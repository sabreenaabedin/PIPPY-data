Abby says…I have a question about Bite Beauty’s Agave Lip Mask. It claims its natural formula smoothes, nourishes and moisturizes lips with a bio active combination of organic agave nectar, jojoba oil, vanilla co2 extract, and triple the amount of the antioxidant trans-resveratrol found in red wine. It doesn’t mention anything about it containing lead so I’m wondering if it’s safe and effective to use on dry lips. I’m also wondering if you can tell me if there’s anything else on the market that might be similar to this because this is very expensive. Bite Beauty, in case you’re not aware, is a Toronto based company that hand crafts lip products using “food-grade, or good-enough-to-eat ingredients.” Their credo is to prove that “there’s no sacrifice in quality for products sourced from nature.” That sounds quite noble but of course it’s never as simple as that. Mainly because when it comes to cosmetics everyone has a different definition of what “sourced from nature” means. But let’s set that aside for the moment and focus on what this particular lip mask. Most of the hype is around the ingredients Abby mentioned: the agave, the “CO2”vanilla, and the resveratrol but let’s use our “Rule of 5” to look at the PRIMARY ingredients in the product: lanolin, castor oil, agave, olive oil and beeswax. Lanolin is the first ingredient and it’s perfectly reasonable for use in a product like this because it’s composed of waxy, cholesterol-like materials and other skin compatible lipids. That means it’s good for sealing moisture into skin and making skin softer and more pliable. The big negative of lanolin is that some percentage of the population is allergic to it. It also gets a lot of criticism because it’s an animal by product. You don’t have to kill the sheep – it just comes from the oil on the wool. But still, it’s animal derived which some people don’t like. Castor oil is another good emollient. Do you know why it’s called “castor” oil? I always that original it was used to lubricate casters…those rollers used on the bottom of some kinds of furniture. But that’s not it all all. Castor oil was originally used as a replacement for the oil from the perineal glands of beavers. And the latin word for beaver is “castor.” Anyway, when properly mixed with other ingredients it can form a nice film on the lips which make it good for a “lip mask.” Next is agave which is essentially cactus nectar. It doesn’t have ANY benefits to the skin that I’m aware of. (Maybe it can help bind a little more moisture but the other ingredients really have that covered.) It’s primary used as a sweetener so in this formula it just makes the product taste better. It does have the advantage of having a lower glycemic load which means it doesn’t have much impact on your blood sugar. That might be a big deal dealing with a product like a sweetened soft drink because you’re consuming a lot of it. If you drink a can of soda with sugar it can mess with your blood sugar levels but a drink sweetened with agave isn’t as bad. Of course, that doesn’t matter very much when you’re talking about a lip balm because you apply such a small amount. Instead of 1 calorie you’re ingesting 0.5 calories. It doesn’t really matter. Olive oil unsaponifiables, which are also known as hydrogenated olive oil, is the next ingredient. This is a solidified version of olive oil that has some skin moisturizing benefits and also contributes to the heavier feel of the product. Beeswax rounds out the top 5 ingredients and it’s there simply to give the product a thicker consistency. This product is not in stick form it’s packaged in a small squeeze tube so it’s more fluid. Beeswax helps, to some extent, seal in moisture so it’s a good thickener for a product like this. So these are the ingredients that provide the form and function of the product. The vanilla, which Abby also asked about, is just there as a flavoring agent. The fact that’s it’s CO2 vanilla just means that it was extracted from the vanilla bean using carbon dioxide and high pressure rather than a solvent like alcohol. Supposedly this means the aroma of the extract is closer to the aroma of the original vanilla bean but it doesn’t necessarily give the vanilla any super powers. It may just make it taste a little bit better. And that brings us to the resveratrol which is often touted as a miracle anti-aging ingredient. This all started because of a few studies back in the early 2000’s which showed that if you give older mice high doses of resveratrol they are able to more successfully walk across a balance beam. Another study showed it made lazy mice look like they had exercised. There haven’t been very many studies on the effect of resveratrol on skin. There was a 2005 study that indicated topically applied resveratrol can protect skin from UV damage but again this was an animal study. A couple of studies have been done on humans: a 2012 study showed that people who took the ingredient orally had better quality skin and a 2011 study showed that resveratrol gel improved acne. But overall, the scientific consensus is that the benefits of topically applied resveratrol are not well established. The fact that this product contains “triple the amount of resveratrol found in red wine” isn’t that relevant because you’re applying such a small amount. So at best you’re applying a very small amount of a compound that hasn’t really been proven to have much of an effect. On the plus side it may help you walk better on a balance beam. So back to Abby’s question about less expensive substitutes for this Bite Beauty product. If the agave is just there for sweetness, the vanilla for flavor and the resveratrol…well probably not much. So let’s say for the sake of argument you don’t need to worry about finding a product with those ingredients. What SHOULD you look for? Since the majority of the product is lanolin I’d look for another lanolin based product. We can’t tell you how to find a product that will FEEL the same way but we can give you a couple of options that are close enough for you to maybe want to try and they’ll be a hell of a lot cheaper. First there’s Koru Naturals lip balm. It contains just two ingredients: USP Grade Lanolin and Sunflower Seed Wax. It only costs $2.80 for a 0.15 ounce stick. And then there’s Lanicare which contains Lanolin, Castor Seed Oil, Olive Oil Unsaponifiables and Beeswax. That’s also about $3.00 per stick. Both of these products are about a tenth of the cost of Bite Beauty so they certainly seem worth a try. Bite Beauty Agave Lip Mask Ingredient list: Lanolin* (medical grade), Organic Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil**, Organic Agave Tequilana (blue agave) nectar**, Olea Europaea (Olive) Oil Unsaponifiables*, Organic Cera Alba (Beeswax)**, Flavor, Vanillin, Siraitia Grosvenori (Monk Fruit)*, Vanilla Tahitensis (Vanilla) Fruit Extract*, Organic Copernicia Cerifera (Carnauba) Wax*, Trans-Resveratrol*, Vitis Vinefera (Grape) oil*, Tocopherol acetate*, Lonicera Caprifolium (Honeysuckle) Flower Extract (And) Lonicera Japonica (Honeysuckle) Flower Extract (and) Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil*. What’s the deal with K Beauty anti-aging alginate masks? Kate in our Forum asks…. There is this new beauty trend going on in Japan and South Korea – Alginate Masks. They work by mixing alignate mask with water, then you need to apply it to the face, leave the mask in place for at least 15 minute, then remove by peeling it off in one piece. These masks claim to have lifting effect, reduce wrinkles and hyper pigmentation. Is this something new that can actually work on skin and penetrate it? Or is it another foolish trend created by marketers? To answer Kate’s question let’s start by explaining what it means for a product to be a “mask.” In her original Forum post Kate asks about two ingredients that she saw popping up in a number of these K Beauty mask products: Calcium sulfate and Sodium alginate. Alginate is a material derived from seaweed and it’s a polysaccharide, sort of a long chain of sugary-starch material. When alginate is combined with a divalent atom like calcium, these long chains of starches are connected together in a process we call cross linking. So when this cross-linked mixture dries, it forms a film. That’s the basic property of any mask – the ability to form a film on your face. That film serves two purposes. First, it provides a tightening feeling because it’s pulling on your skin. That may give the look and feel of lifting and may temporarily tighten some wrinkles. But these benefits only last until the mask is washed away. The second function of the film is to hold other ingredients, like anti-aging actives, onto your skin. Remember, that for anti-aging ingredients to be effective a few conditions must be met. First, the ingredient must be efficacious, just because a company CLAIMS an ingredient will do something doesn’t mean it really works. Second, you need to have that ingredient in the right form, delivered from the right kind of forumula (e.g, pH), third it has to be at the right concentration. And lastly it has to have enough time to get to it needs to do. Some ingredients don’t need to penetrate into the deeper layers of the stratum corneum to work and they work fairly quickly. Others need to be on skin for a lot longer. And that brings us to the problem with masks. There are three problems actually. 1. Masks are limited in the types of ingredients they can contain. Unlike a cream or lotion where you can easily combine oil and water soluble ingredients, masks tend to be made with more water soluble ingredients. 2. Masks are not the best delivery vehicle because the ingredients can be trapped in the film which prohibits them from fully contacting the skin . 3. And most important, unlike other product forms masks are only left on the skin a relatively short period of time which limits the kind of anti-aging effects it can have. Specifically Kate asked about reducing wrinkles and hyper pigmentation. Ingredients that are effective against these symptoms of aging need to be in contact with skin for a LONG time. Think hours, not minutes. Anti-aging ingredients work best when left in contact with skin. So whether it’s a cleanser or a toner or a mask, if the product isn’t left on the skin you KNOW it’s not going to work as well. The bottom line is that masks are fun to use and provide a temporary benefit but they can’t be your main anti-aging weapon. Is baby shampoo good for adults? Alessandra asks…Is Johnson’s Baby shampoo a gentle sulfate-free option for fine-haired adults who don’t use many styling products (and an inexpensive alternative to fancy salon “low-poo” products)? Or is it as harsh as stylists say, because in order to make the product non-irritating to the eyes, its pH is really unsuitable to the hair? First let’s talk about what’s in J&J baby shampoo. We’ll put the complete ingredient list in the show notes for your reference. The first thing you’ll notice is that the ingredients look different than regular “adult” shampoos. Remember the ingredients most commonly used in adult shampoos are sodium or ammonium lauryl and laureth sulfate (SLS, SLES, etc). These are anionic surfactants meaning they tend to have a negative charge, they are high foaming, good degreasers, and unfortunately, can intereact with skin in such a way that causes irritation for some people. Now, in typically for a baby shampoo, and certainly in the case of J&J the first ingredient after water is what we call a non-ionic surfactant. In this case it’s PEG-80 Sorbitan Laurate. This type of detergent doesn’t foam as much so it doesn’t clean as well but it is milder because of the way it interacts with skin. You’ll also see Cocamidopropyl Betaine which is a cleanser and foam booster used in both baby and adult shampoos. It can be made from coconut oil so even though it’s chemically processed you’ll see it featured in some natural products. Next is PEG-150 Distearate. This is another non-ionic compound but this one doesn’t do much cleaning. Rather it’s used as an emulsifier to tie the system together and to add some thickening. Finally, there’s sodium trideceth sulfate. How can this product be sulfate free if it contains a sulfate? “Sulfate free” really refers to free of SLS, etc. This surfactant is considered more of an non-ionic because of the mildness that the “trideceth” portion of the molecule provides. So these 4 ingredients provide the backbone of the formula. Of course it contains preservatives, colorants, and fragrance as well. It also contains a touch of polyquarternium-10 which is a polymer that can provide a little bit of conditioning but it won’t give the same kind of feel of silicones or guar that you’ll find in adult conditioning shampoos. One more thing…it contains sodium hydroxide which is a horrible chemical that can burn through your skin. Do you want to explain how that can be in a baby shampoo? NaOH is very basic which means it has a high pH. But a very small amount can be used to adjust to the pH. When you adjust the pH the base reacts with the acid and is neutralized. In other words the sodium hydroxide is “used up” and isn’t even really in the product any more. So you don’t need to worry about it. The pH of this product is about 7 which is close to the pH of tears which is one of the reasons it doesn’t hurt babies’ eyes. But to answer Alessandra’s question, is this stuff too harsh as she said? I’ve even heard it said that I baby shampoo is harsh because it’s loaded with detergents to help get rid of cradle cap. That’s not true. You don’t need a lot of detergent for that more just mechanical washing. What you might need is a keralytic agent that would help speed up skin cells sloughing off but those are not used in regular baby shampoo. So baby shampoo is NOT harsh but that doesn’t mean it’ll leave your hair feeling smooth. Some people think baby shampoo feels rough because of what it DOESN’T contain: there aren’t really any major moisturizers or silicones in it to coat the hair and counter balance all the surfactants. The bottom line is that you may not like the way baby shampoo makes your hair feel but it’s not harsh and irritating. Ingredients: Water, PEG-80 Sorbitan Laurate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, PEG-150 Distearate, Phenoxyethanol, Glycerin, Citric Acid, Fragrance, Sodium Benzoate, Tetrasodium EDTA, Polyquaternium-10, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Hydroxide, Potassium Acrylates Copolymer, Yellow 6, Yellow 10. Beauty Science News Daily Consumption of a Fruit and Vegetable Smoothie Alters Facial Skin Color. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26186449 Remember that time I ate 3 pounds of carrots in one night in an attempt to turn my skin orange? Well, it turns out that that experiment wasn’t so crazy after all. In an article published in the journal PLOS One researchers found that daily consumption of fruit and vegetables produced a measurable skin color change. Here’s what they did. They took a group of 81 university students both male and female and measured their skin color using a chronometer. I should mention these were all from an Asian population. They were able to get a LAB value for yellowness, redness & luminance. Remember we used to do measurements like that. Anyway, they gave half the group a fruit smoothie to drink daily and the control group got mineral water. Over the course of 6 weeks they did skin measurements to see what would happen. It turns out there was a large increase in skin yellowness in the test group and a slight increase in skin redness after 4 weeks of testing. This effect remained for even 2 weeks after they stopped the test. So, if you have Asian skin and you are interested in changing the color, perhaps a daily fruit smoothie rich in carotenoids is the way to go. Ya know, I’ve always been skeptical of this “beauty from within” trend but this is at least some evidence that it could work. Why is Homeland Security interested in cosmetic products? http://www.cosmeticsdesign.com/Regulation-Safety/What-does-Homeland-Security-want-with-beauty-industry-part-1-CFATS Normally we say you shouldn’t believe all the hype about dangerous cosmetic ingredients. But it turns out that some cosmetic ingredients are so hazardous that Homeland security has gotten involved. The danger is not from using cosmetic products, those are safe, but certain raw materials in high concentrations can be weaponized. For example, here are 3 common cosmetic ingredients that can be used in explosive devices: If there are any terrorists listening please cover your ears: triethanolamine which is used as a pH control agent, hydrogen peroxide which is used in hair lighters and a bunch of other products, and powdered aluminum which is used in color cosmetics. So, Homeland Security is working with cosmetic companies that have large stock piles of these ingredients to help them ensure the materials remain secure. The only time I’ve seen cosmetic chemistry threaten homeland security was that time you were doing some testing in the lab and and you set a comb on fire. Remember that? iTunes reviews Abky25 says…5 stars. This podcast is a must for anyone who wants to be informed about the products they’re using. Since I started listening to this i’ve really reduced the amount of money I spend on skin products. I will say the podcast can get a bit boring after a while. Overall, these guys are easy to listen to and just so knowledgeable!! Disparate Housewife from Ireland says…Beauty is an industry and this podcast holds them to standards while guiding listeners to be savvy consumers. I love that the hosts are intelligent and have a fun sense of humour. Monika from Sweden says…You’ve saved me so much money and I love to listen to you on my morning commute. Um, please says…I never write reviews but this podcast is just so awesome I had to share the love! These guys address all your cosmetic questions in a fun, quick, and educational way.","How can you find a cheaper natural lip balm?

Episode 162 by Perry Romanowski http://media.blubrry.com/thebeautybrains/p/thebeautybrains.com/wp-content/uploads/podcast/Episode162.mp3 Podcast: Play in new window | Download Subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Android | RSS Can you use diaper rash cream as sunscreen? Mari asks…Today a customer came into the retail pharmacy where I work and demanded that we sell him zinc oxide diaper rash paste so he could use it as sunscreen. I tried to steer him in the direction of actual sunscreens with listed SPFs, but he was not to be dissuaded and ended up leaving with a tube of generic diaper rash cream (with no listed SPF) in hand. His rationale was that diaper rash paste has a higher percentage of zinc oxide than zinc oxide sunscreens. Although this is sometimes true, depending on the brand, my concern is that (a) the formulation of a diaper rash paste might not make it an effective sunscreen and (b) without a listed SPF, there’s no way to really know. What are your thoughts on this? We’ve talked quite a bit about sunscreens on the showgram but believe this is the first time that diaper rash products have come up. So a little quick background discussion is in order. We used to think that urine was the primary cause of diaper rash which makes sense since a baby (especially under 2 months) can urinate up to 20 times per day. But the hypothesis was that urine releases ammonia which raises the pH of skin which opens it up to damage. But it turns out urine is NOT the primary cause…it’s feces. The pH of feces is acidic due to bile and studies have shown that diaper rash is more prominent where the feces contact the skin. This contact can lead to yeast and bacterial infection. So mark your calendars that today was the day that the whole urine-diaper rash myth was busted. And that brings us back to diaper rash creams. In case you didn’t know, both sunscreens and diaper creams are Over the Counter drugs and are controlled by the FDA. Sunscreens are 1 type of drug…they are sunscreens. But diaper rash creams are actually not 1…not 2…not 3 but actually 4 different types of drug products: External Analgesic, Topical Antifungal, Topical Antimicrobial, and Skin Protectant. In addition to Zinc Oxide other approved diaper rash ingredients include mineral oil, petrolatum, cornstarch, allantoin, calamine, dimethicone, kaolin clay, and cod liver oil. How does ZnO help with diaper rash? It works 3 ways: It helps water proof (or feces proof) skin, it’s a mild astringent which means it can cause the contraction of body tissues, and it has some antimicrobial properties. That’s what makes it suitable for use in the 4 drug product categories we just mentioned. So Zinc Oxide is an approved drug ingredient that is used in both products. But does that mean you could use them interchangeably? Can you use diaper cream as a sunscreen as the demanding gentleman in Mari’s pharmacy intended to do. And conversely, can you use sunscreen on diaper rash? Let’s begin by answering a fundamental question: is the zinc oxide used in diaper creams the same as the zinc oxide used in sunscreens? In classic Beauty Brains fashion, the answer is yes and no. Chemically, they’re identical. Both have to use USP grade [what does USP stand for] which means they have to meet certain purity requirements. BTW did you know that, being a natural product, zinc oxide contains somewhere between 1 and 10 ppm of lead? Physically, there are differences. Zinc oxide powders are sold with different particle sizes and the size of the particle impacts how well the zinc screens out UV rays. It’s even more complicated than that because it’s not just the size of the particles but these particles tend to stick together to form clumps or aggregates which affect how well the zinc scatters UV rays. In addition to different particle sizes zinc oxide is commercially available in different varieties such as surface coated varieties as well as dispersions in different materials like natural oils and silicone fluids. So sunscreens HAVE TO use a version of zinc oxide that’s designed to scatter UV rays…and sunscreens are tested to ensure that they do indeed do that. But diaper rash creams do NOT have to use one of those forms. They may or may not and there’s no way to know since diaper rash products are not tested for UV protection. So that’s issue #1. Here’s issue #2: Even if a diaper rash cream uses the exact same grade as a sunscreen, the way the diaper rash cream is formulated can impact level of UV protection it provides. Yeah, the medium in which the zinc is dispersed can determine the final opacity of the product. In other words, the oils, waxes, and other ingredients used in diaper creams can make the final formula more transparent in which case it won’t filter out as much UV radiation. And then there’s issue #3: The way the product is processed makes a difference as well. For sunscreens, specific dispersion technology can be used to one way to make sure these particle agglomerates are broken up. Diaper rash products wouldn’t necessarily require the same kind of dispersion technology. What does all this mean? IF a diaper rash cream contains the right kind of ZnO, and IF it’s used at the correct concentration and IF it’s properly processed, and IF the final formula doesn’t contain any ingredients that can compromise the UV scattering properties of the ZnO, THEN you certainly could use a diaper cream as a sunscreen. But the only way to know for sure is to conduct SPF testing and it’s doubtful any company will do that because even if it works they can’t use that data to promote the product? Why not? Because the drug monographs and don’t allow for any combined claims. Even if I knew all those IFs where true I’m not sure I’d want to use diaper rash cream instead of sunscreen. Aesthetically it could be a trainwreck: a diaper cream’s PRIMARY purpose is to create a hydrophobic barrier so they use high amounts of things like petrolatum. A high ZnO/petrolatum cream is great for babies but not very pleasant when smearing all over your face or body. Is there ANY reason why you’d want to do this? I’m guessing it’s motivated by cost: depending on the brand, diaper rash creams can be cheaper than sunscreens. For example, Desitin costs about $1.75/oz while a ZnO-only sunscreen like Badger costs about $4.70/oz. So the Beauty Brains bottom line is amount of money you save is not worth the risk of compromised UV protection or the sacrifice of aesthetics.

Mark asks…is facial massage good for wrinkles? We’ve touched on this before. Way back in Episode 14 we answered a question about facial yoga being good for wrinkles. So go listen to that for a full recap. But the basic idea is that “plumping up” muscles by exercising them gets rid of wrinkles. Massage is essentially another way to stimulate facial muscles. But as we pointed out at the time, muscle laxity is not the cause of wrinkles – rather it’s the collapse of structural elements like collagen and elastin. So if we’ve covered this before why are we answering it again? Because it gives us an excuse to discuss another aspect of this which is using electrical stimulation to get rid of wrinkles. CNN recently reported electro-stim for skin and they quoted Jennifer Aniston who said that “”It’s like a little workout for your face.” And an aesthetician they interviewed said that the more times you have the procedure the more results you’ll see. Sure, get a bunch of treatments – depending on where you have it done it costs between $200 and $600! However, the consensus of the medical experts they talked to is that “there is no data demonstrating its effectiveness.” I did find a couple of papers on the subject. One study tested 6 women. Another evaluated 108 women and did show that the procedure resulted in SOME difference in facial muscle thickness. But it required treatment for 20 min/day, 5 days/week for 12 weeks. That would cost you between $12000 and $36000. Who’s going to spend that kind of money for such a small benefit? As always the important takeaway is that you think critically when you hear about treatments like this. Not everyone thinks like that. RS: When I posted this on Facebook, one commenter said “Clearly Mr. Knott needs to experience micro current himself because regardless of “data” it most certainly does produce results and it is so much more than a “feel good” skincare modality. It seems like he is trying to discredit skincare therapists.” I replied: DM: It may be nice for Mr. Knott to experience the treatment but that doesn’t prove or disprove that it really works. That’s what “data” is for and in this case there doesn’t seem to be sufficient data to prove that this treatment really works. If you’re familiar with any evidence we’d love to see it and share it with our readers. Does this plant extract boost collagen? Ana asks…We love the beautybrains podcast here in Portugal and I finally have a question to ask. I read recently about a plant called bulbine frutescens that is kind of similar to aloe. In some studies it says the juice of the plant stimulates collagen production. Have you heard about it? Do you think it would be a good think to use on the skin for the anti aging properties? Bulbine frutescens is similar to aloe in that their both used in the treatment of skin wounds and burns. We found a study showing that leaf gel extracts can increase collagen deposition in wounds on pig skin. I won’t go into details on how the testing was done but unfortunately I CAN’T say that “no pigs were harmed during the course of this study.” But even if there is some data, before you get too excited, consider 2 of the Kligman questions. Remember what those are? Mechanism, penetration, and data it works on real people. In this case they’re applying the BF leaf extract directly to a wound. So the extract doesn’t need to penetrate and the mechanism of wound healing is NOT the same as the production of normal collagen that keeps your skin looking smooth and healthy. In fact, we couldn’t find anything to suggest this material has anti-aging properties when applied to healthy skin. If it is similar to aloe it may have some moisturizing properties and it may be good for sunburn but don’t expect it to fix the kind of collagen loss we all experience as we age.

Beauty Science News J&J vs natural products Link I want to give a quick mention of an article I saw on Global Cosmetic News about Johnson & Johnson speaking out on natural products. First of all I love the title: J&J calls parents bluff over natural baby products. Let me quote the article: “While many parents want all-natural products for their baby, natural or organic isn’t always what’s safest for baby,” said David Mays, Senior Director of Global Scientific Engagement at Johnson & Johnson in an email sent to Forbes. “The debate over naturals and chemicals has been oversimplified where many consumers now believe that the more natural something is, the better and safer it is. It’s just not that simple and in fact that oversimplification is doing a great disservice to consumers.” I think important take away is this quote: ‘being natural is never more important than being safe.’ Artificial sun tan Link iTunes reviews Ouija says…Your “showgrams” are fun, educational, and a much needed public service. Put me down for a yes on the banter. Tornadogirl1981 from Germany says…So useful! Should be on a list for everyone who spends money on skincare.

Monika asks…Korean Bee Venom essence but it does seem to work. My question is the bee venom really magic or is there something else that removes the spots? RS: Thanks Monika…this gives me the perfect excuse time to remind listeners to go back to Episode 105 and listen to the story about how Perry got stung in the eye by a bee. If nothing else, just go the webpage and check out the picture of his face. It’s horrific. I’m not kidding. But let’s put my personal revulsion aside and try to figure out why this product seemed to work on Monika’s acne. PR: We found a study published in the Journal of Integrative Medicine titled “Effects of cosmetics containing purified honeybee (Apis mellifera L.) venom on acne vulgaris.” The researchers did testing in the lab and found that bee venom can kill p acne which is the bacteria that is a contributing cause of zits. Then they did a study on real people and found that a significant decrease in inflammatory and noninflammatory acne lesions. The P value was only 0.027 which is not very statistically sound but at least there’s a reasonable chance this really works on acne. RS: BTW, the product also contains azelaic acid and willow bark extract which is a natural source of salicylic acid. Both of these acids are drugs that are proven help acne so they could be responsible for the improvement you saw. But this raised the larger question about the trend of using bee venom in beauty products, specifically in anti-aging products. Anyway, is bee venom a good skin care ingredient? PR: As always when looking at functionality of cosmetic ingredients we try to answer the 3 Kligman questions. RS: Does it penetrate? Sure it does…when you get stung by a bee. But I couldn’t find any clear evidence that it penetrates when applied topically. There are studies on bee venom as wound healing agent but of course open wounds are NOT the same as healthy intact skin. So that doesn’t tell us much. We can infer it penetrates based on some of the efficacy studies we’ll discuss in a moment but it certainly is not a clear cut YES. PR: Is there a mechanism to describe how bee venom could theoretically reduce wrinkles or improve the appearance of your skin in any way? Again, this is murky at best. Bee venom does have some anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties and it’s been used for conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease and even cancer. But this has little to do with skin. Apparently it has some some antimicrobial properties which could make it beneficial for certain skin conditions. We did find a study done in vitro showing it can decrease the formation of a type II collagen (which is how it helps treat arthritis). Melittin is the majority chemical found in bee venom is SAID TO increase/boost collagen production. But we couldn’t find anything explaining how it could do this or how it could reduce their degradation which is what you’d expect in an anti-wrinkle product. RS: Okay then, what about the third (and most important) Kligman question: Is there evidence that bee venom reduces wrinkles when applied to real people? Well, there’s some evidence but I wouldn’t call it very good. I thought we had hit the jackpot when we found the study “The beneficial effects of honeybee-venom serum on facial wrinkles in humans.” I mean how much more on point could you ask for, than that? PR: Here’s what they did: First they got some bee venom. That in itself is not an insignificant task. Here’s how the facial study paper described it…”the bee-venom collector was placed on the hive, and the bees were given enough electric shocks to cause them to sting a glass plate, from which dried bee venom was later scraped off. The collected venom was diluted in cold sterile water and then centrifuged at 10,000 g for 5 minutes at 4°C. Purified bee venom was then freeze-dried and refrigerated at 4°C for later use. They took the bee venom and formulated it into a serum at 0.006%. There was no discussion of what else was in this serum. Which, by the way, is kind of important. RS: Next they recruited 22 women ages 30 to 49 and asked them to apply this serum to their faces twice daily for 12 weeks. The researchers did a clinical evaluation before the test and at 4, 8 and 12 weeks. Here’s what they found: The average visual grade of all patients significantly improved with the bee-venom serum treatment: 6.64% at 8 weeks (P=0.002) and almost 12% at 12 weeks. (P=0.0003) I don’t even know what that means. They also directly measured wrinkles using a couple different techniques, one was total wrinkle count. Results showed that total wrinkles went from about 104 initially to about 100 after 12 weeks. Plus or minus 32. Huh? There were similarly confusing results for wrinkle depth and total wrinkle area. PR: Even if these numbers showed a conclusive reduction in wrinkles the data would still be suspect because the study was done with out a proper control. The product is just tested against nothing so we don’t know if some other factor cause the change or if other ingredients in the serum moisturized skin and therefore provided a modest reduction in wrinkles. There’s just no way to know. RS: So what’s the bottom line? There seems to be a CHANCE bee venom may be helpful in treating acne, but we have data showing how it compares to conventional treatment like sal acid or B.P. There seems to be even less evidence that bee venom has any reliable anti-aging properties. By the way, thanks you Paige DeGarmo for providing much of the research we used in answering this question.

Vanessa asks…I just saw a video of someone saying she uses Nizoral dandruff shampoo as a face mask or face cleanser for clearing tiny bumps on her face. Would this really work? RS: This is one of those practices that sounds like an urban myth..I was ready to call B.S. on this one. Until we did a little digging. PR: First, a little background on Nizoral. The active ingredient in that formula that stops dandruff is an anti fungal agent called ketoconazole. It kills the fungus that causes dandruff. That’s unlike most dandruff shampoos, like Head and Shoulders, that use zinc pyrithione. Did Nizoral get an NDA? RS: Second, let’s talk about face bumps. It’s like a fist bump but done with your face. What causes face bumps? PR: Of course there is acne but that condition is caused by bacteria (among other factors) not related to fungus. RS: There’s Milia which is a skin condition characterized by small white bumps. These are typically keratin-filled cysts that are harmless. Milia is extremely common in infants (but adults get it too) and it’s believed to be caused by oil producing glands in your skin that are not fully developed. But they have nothing to do with fungus. RS: What about razor bumps? No, those are caused by ingrown hairs, not fungi. PR: BUT…there is a condition called “Pityrosporum folliculitis” which is caused by a yeast that can colonize the hair follicles and cause itchy, acne like bumps. RS: I believe it’s pronounced “Pity the forum you like to eat us” RS: It’s not TYPICALLY found on your face…most commonly found in what is called “the cape distribution.” I had never heard that term but it refers to the upper chest and upper back. Which is wear a cape would contact your skin. The bumps are said to be pinhead sized and uniform. PR: Everyone has this yeast but in some cases it can grow like crazy. Contributing factors including applying greasy ingredients, like coconut oil, to your skin and wearing tight clothing that doesn’t breath. RS: Which is why all the best dressed superheroes only wear capes made from cotton. PR: Why are we spending so much time discussing this condition? Because this particular kind of yeast can be killed by ketoconazole. And that brings us back to Nizoral. According to the American Osteopathic College of Dermatology, washing your face with Nizoral weekly can get rid of face bumps. The best practice is to apply it to your face and leave it on for about 10 minutes before rinsing it off. However, you should be aware that treatment with ketoconazole doesn’t always work. RS: So the bottom line it that IF your face bumps are caused by “Pliny thesaurus, come and fight us” then washing your face with a dandruff shampoo containing ketoconazole MIGHT help. But if some other condition is the cause then you’re totally wasting your time. In that case, consult a dermatologist. Reference: http://www.aocd.org/?page=PityrosporumFollicu Is dry conditioner the next dry shampoo? Melissa Mary asks…Have you seen some of the dry conditioner formulas lately? They seem to be sold in specialty beauty stores like Ulta and Sephora. I’m not sure if they’ve made their way to drugstores yet. Are they essentially just shine sprays? Would they work well with dry shampoo? RS: Dry Shampoos have been popular for several years now. In fact, we worked on the first successful mass market dry shampoo, Tresemme Fresh Start. PR: But we weren’t familiar with dry conditioners until now. Melissa Mary provided a link to a couple of example products. One is from Amika and it’s an alcohol based spray with some silicone and cationic type conditioning agents. RS: The other is Drybar’s Detox Dry Conditioner I can’t figure it out. According to a Sephora website it’s a very light light aerosol spray that you apply to dry hair. But the ingredient list they provide must be wrong because it looks exactly like a conventional rinse out conditioner with fatty alcohol, silicones, and quats. It could even be a No Poo Spray (although that sounds like some sort of aerosol laxative.) Regardless, this kind of product couldn’t be sprayed in the way shown in the video. So I’m guessing the ingredient list is wrong. PR: We can tell you, though, that these products appear to be more conditioning than a shine spray because shine sprays are pretty much just pure silicone. Typically Cyclomethicone is used because it evaporates and it’s paired with something like dimethicone which gives good shine. RS: But I still don’t understand the point of these products. I don’t really see how these would work with a dry shampoo, though, because dry shampoos leave a powder in your hair. Would you really put another leave in product on after that? Or do you use them instead of a dry shampoo in which case you’re applying them to dirty hair which is just going to make it weighed down? It makes no sense!

"The Beauty Brains","","Why is new Dove Intensive Moisture their most effective conditioner yet by The Beauty Brains Kari’s question… While I was watching House Hunters last night I saw an ad for Dove’s Intensive Moisture conditioner and they said it’s their most effective conditioner yet. I’m pretty sure I’ve seen this kind of claim before. Is it true that haircare products just keeps getting better and better or is this just marketing hype? The Beauty Brains respond: There’s no doubt that this is hype but, rest assured, it is hype that Dove has supported with some kind of test data. How cosmetic companies improve formulations When cosmetic companies upgrade their formulas they always find some way to make them a little bit better. They typically approach an upgrade in two ways: they look for technical performance measures which demonstrate that the new product is better than the old and they conduct broad scale consumer testing to ensure that the new formula is at least as well liked by consumers as the old one. However, that doesn’t necessarily mean that any improvements measured in the laboratory will be perceived by you, the consumer. This combination of consumer test data and technical measurement is enough to support the claim “new and improved.” (Read this cosmetic claims substantiation case study if you want to get a better feel for how to dissect claims.) New and improved claims Based on the the ingredient list below, the new Dove formula is a fairly conventional blend of fatty alcohols, quaternary ammonium compounds, and cationic silicones but the various Dove commercials for this product do make a couple of interesting claims: Gives your hair all the benefits of a treatment at the speed of a conditioner This is not surprising since, as we’ve explained before, hair care products start to work almost instantly and don’t really need to sit on your hair for very long. The exception is coconut oil that can penetrate into the cortex – that takes more time. Keratin Repair Actives absorb into Keratin already present in your hair and repair proteins at the cellular level. The “cellular level” claim sounds great but what does that really mean? Anything that chemically binds to protein could be said to work at that level. Repairs and seals lifted cuticles to help protect from future damage. While “repair” is a fairly strong claim it can be supported with data showing improvement. That doesn’t mean it’s permanent repair though. Any good conditioner will smooth lifted cuticles to some degree. (The only way to permanently repair hair is to cut off the damaged part, keep that in mind the next time you schedule an appointment at Rush Hair .)

"The Beauty Brains","2014-02-03 18:59:00","Is Sweat Bad for Your Scalp and Hair? by The Beauty Brains Sillabear says… I am looking for ways to minimize the amount of times that I wash my hair and I recently came across information that utilizing a mixture of 1:2 parts of peppermint oil to jojoba oil will break down the salts that are deposited on the scalp from pores after a strenuous exercise. Is this true? If not, do products such as dry shampoo rid one’s scalp of these potentially damaging salts? The Beauty Brains respond: Before we talk about sweat removal, let’s do a quick recap of what’s in sweat. Sweaty chemistry Our bodies sweat through two different glands: eccrine (which are found pretty much all over the body) and apocrine (which are concentrated where there are hair follicles.) Both glands produce sweat that consists of water and minerals (or salts). Specifically, sweat contains sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium. But only the apocrine glands product lactate, urea, and other substances which make this milky sweat so tasty to odor causing bacteria. Peppermint oil or jojoba oil have no special ability to breakdown or remove sweat. Peppermint oil could have some antibacterial properties which might inhibit some of the odor associated with eccrine gland perspiration but it is also a mild irritant and may end up making your scalp inflamed. The “stuff” you’re trying to get rid of like salts, Sodium lactate and urea are water soluble so jojoba oil won’t do much to remove them either. A dry shampoo which contains a water absorbent starch might help “soak up” some of these materials if you’re that determined to get them off your scalp. Which brings us to the main point of this post… Is sweat bad for scalp? Why do you think that salts from sweat are damaging in the first place? And what exactly do you think is becoming damaged? Your skin? Your hair? That may not be the case! In fact, some of the components of sweat have skin moisturizing properties. (Lactate and urea are found in many skin lotions.) And there’s some evidence that suggests sweat may actually keep you healthy by helping to ward off certain microorganisms. The Beauty Brains bottom line If you’re sweaty and stinky you should certainly clean up as needed. But if you’re just worried about sweat “damaging” your scalp or hair it’s probably less of a problem than you realize.

"Randy Schueller","2017-04-16 18:01:00","Does lipstick expose you to dangerous levels of lead? by Randy Schueller You’ve all heard the scary stories about lead in lipstick and, yes, it’s true that most brands of lipstick contain lead. But do they contain enough lead to pose a hazard to your health? Let’s find out with the Beauty Brains “Lead in Lipstick” calculator. (References for each data point are included if you want to look up any of this for yourself.) Question: How much lead is added to your body from lipstick? Fact 1. How much lead is in your brand of lipstick? Let’s assume the worst case scenario: the brand/shade with the highest lead content is Maybelline Pink Petal with 7.19 mcg/g (that’s micrograms of lead per gram of lipstick. A microgram is 1/1,000,000 of a gram or about 1/28,000,000 of an ounce.) You can also think of it this way: one microgram is like a single ant swimming in a pool the size of Central Park. ( http://www.fda.gov/Cosmetics/ProductandIngredientSafety/ProductInformation/ucm137224.htm#expanalyses) Fact 2. How many times a day do you apply lipstick? We’ll assume five applications per day which is fairly heavy use. (http://www.snopes.com/science/stats/lipstick.asp) Fact 3. How much lipstick is deposited on your lips per application? A tube of lipstick weighs about 3 grams which will provide about 400 applications. Therefore a single application delivers about 7.3 milligrams to your lips. (http://www.snopes.com/science/stats/lipstick.asp) Fact 4. How much of that lipstick do you swallow during the day? We know that much of your lipstick ends up on napkins, coffee cups, and body parts but again let’s use the worst case scenario and assume that ALL the lipstick you apply to your lips is swallowed. Answer: Based on these calculations the absolute most lead you could swallow from lipstick is about 0.3 micrograms per day. (For most people it will far less than that.) Is that much lead bad? Read on. Question: Is 0.3 micrograms of lead a dangerous amount to swallow? Fact 1. How much of that lead gets into your blood? The lead in lipstick is tied up in the color pigments and it takes a very strong chemical reaction (using hydrofluoric acid) to release the lead so it can be absorbed into your blood. So, in reality, a large portion of the lead you swallow doesn’t get into your blood at all, it passes right through your body. (One reference says your body only absorbs about 10% of the lead you swallow) But, once again, let’s assume the worst case and figure that 100% of the lead you swallow stays in your body. So that means your daily lipstick use will add 0.3 micrograms of lead to your blood. (Hepp, N.M.., “Determination of Total Lead in 400 Lipsticks on the U.S. Market Using a Validated Microwave-Assisted Digestion, Inductively Coupled Plasma–Mass Spectrometric Method,” Journal of Cosmetic Science, accepted for publication in May/June, 2012, issue and http://www.lecbiz.com/serv02.htm) Fact 2. How much lead is normally in your body? Even though you hear that there is no safe level of lead, every healthy adult has some amount of lead in their blood from drinking water, foods, and the environment. According to the CDC, the average healthy adult person has 1.4 micrograms per deciliter of blood. That means an average woman (130 pounds, 5 feet 6 inches) will have a total of 53.5 micrograms of lead in her blood. Therefore, the additional 0.3 micrograms from your daily lipstick usage will increase the total amount of lead in the average person’s blood from 53.5 micrograms to 53.8. (http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/ables/pdfs/ABLES_EBLL_050112.pdf) and http://easycalculation.com/medical/blood-volume.php) Fact 3. How much lead is dangerous? While this is a controversial point the CDC says that for non-pregnant adults the total Blood Lead Level (or BLL) should be below 10 mcg/dl which is a total of 382 mcg in an average person’s blood. If the BLL is above 382 mcg, then the CDC recommends you seek medical treatment. As you can see, going from 53.5 mcg to 53.8 mcg doesn’t put you anywhere near that limit. The average person would have to ingest an additional 328 micrograms of lead in a single day to cross this threshold. It would take 15 tubes of lipstick to give you that much lead! (http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/ables/description.html) Answer: Based on the calculations used above, you’d have to EAT 15 entire tubes of lipstick in a single day to elevate your blood lead level to the point where the CDC would say it’s necessary to take action. Obviously the small amount of lead you swallow from lipstick each day presents very little risk. Question: So one day’s worth of lipstick lead is fine but you wear lipstick everyday. Does lead build up over time? Fact 1. How much lead are you taking in every day from lipstick? We’ve just shown that in the worst case scenario lipstick adds an extra 0.3 micrograms of lead to your blood every day. Fact 2. How much lead does your body get rid of every day? Studies have shown that every day your body can get rid of about 35 mcg.(mostly through urine and feces.) (http://digitalcommons.mcmaster.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2526&context=opendissertations and http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC333178/pdf/jcinvest00644-0006.pdf) Answer: Lipstick doesn’t cause any buildup of lead in your blood over time because you’re only taking in about 1/100 of what your body removes. The Beauty Brains bottom line Even assuming you’re a heavy lipstick user, the amount of lead from your daily lipstick usage only raises your blood lead level by a very small amount. Over time your body excretes far more lead than you take in from lipstick. Lead poisoning from other sources IS a serious problem (especially for children) but non-pregnant adults don’t need to worry about getting lead poisoning from lipstick. Final note: we’re cosmetic chemists, not toxicologists, and we invite anyone with additional knowledge on this subject to check our numbers and assumptions. We’ll gladly update this article if new information comes to light.","Does lipstick expose you to dangerous levels of lead?","c49f594938c02bb1372b046ba1d25a18b8844ce5","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2013/04/does-lipstick-expose-you-to-dangerous-levels-of-lead/"
"Perry Romanowski","","Is fluoride toothpaste giving me cancer by Perry Romanowski Michelle says: I am not even sure I trust the dentists to do the teeth whitening. They say they can carefully control the application, but I am still really skeptical that the H2O2 itself cannot do long term damage to the enamel – and if one wants to be cynical – more business for them in the future in terms of cavities. After all this is still a profession that gives patients high dose fluoride treatments when the ex-head of the EPA under Clinton stated that when they did their internal testing, there was no more potent carcinogen than fluoride, and informed governments around the world are starting to remove it from the water supply. The Beauty Brains respond: Michelle’s comment comes from our recent post on using OxyClean to whiten teeth and we felt it deserved a quick rebuttal. Is there a link between fluoride and cancer? Fluoride and tooth decay share a long and interesting history. It all started with the discovery that people living in areas with water supplies with naturally occurring fluoride had lower incidence of cavities. This knowledge led to the addition of fluoride not only to toothpastes but to public drinking water. The latter prompted rumors of a Communist conspiracy which, mostly, have faded away. Health concerns associated with fluoride remain but there seems to be little data to indicate there’s really a problem in regard to cancer. In fact, according to the Centers for Disease Control, adding fluoride to water supplies has been “one of the greatest achievements in public health in the 20th century.” More importantly, multiple animal and human studies have failed to show a link between fluoride and cancer. Researchers reviewed over 2.2 million cancer death records and 125,000 cancer case records from places where fluoridated water is used and found no indication of increased cancer risk. You can read all the details at cancer.gov . Are governments removing fluoride from water supplies? Michelle’s comment about “informed governments” removing fluoride from drinking water is interesting but we could find no evidence to support that notion. It is true that too much fluoride can cause a condition called fluoridosis which can initially cause teeth to turn mottled and brown eventually cause irreversible skeletal and nerve damage. This condition is a problem in parts of the world which have high exposure to fluoride due eating food grown with fluoride-containing fertilizers, drinking ground water contaminated with excess fluoride, or breathing fumes generated by burning fluoride-containing coal. In those areas where this problem exists UNICEF is working on de-fluoridation programs with local governments. However this has nothing to do with cancer risk and it does NOT mean that governments are eliminating water fluoridation programs in areas that need it (in other words, areas that have low levels of naturally occurring fluoride.) The bottom line At the time of this writing, Michelle just posted an additional comment with some references that make a case against fluoride. You can read it here . If you time to jump down the rabbit hole, we suggest you read this reference she provided. We responded with additional references from skeptical websites that basically repeat what we’ve said above. It looks like this controversy rages on and while we appreciates Michelle’s point of view we’re not convinced. Hopefully, if fluoride really is dangerous, something will turn up in the mainstream, peer-reviewed scientific literature. In the meantime we’ll keep brushing with our Colgate with fluoride.","Is fluoride toothpaste giving me cancer","82dbb3e4ea4d936a4449c4bf553defe96f5eacc3","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2013/03/is-fluoride-toothpaste-giving-me-cancer/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Is DIY mascara safe? by The Beauty Brains Needleusesman says… This site has recipes for DIY mascara. Not sure if this sounds hygienic and may be risk of getting eye infection? The Beauty Brains respond: Listen up kiddies because the message of this post is as close as we get to a public service announcement: Do not use home made mascara! DIY Danger Beautylish, the site referenced by Needle, recommends making your own mascara by mixing aloe vera gel with powdered charcoal. Supposedly the benefit of this approach is that you avoid preservatives and “excess chemicals.” Unfortunately, whoever wrote this post is not very well informed about cosmetic science and is actually advocating something that is MORE dangerous, not less. Here is what I would say to the writer of that post: Aloe Vera gel is not preservative free First, if your goal is to create s safer product by avoiding preservatives, then you’ve failed from the start because aloe vera gel HAS preservatives in it. Depending on the manufacturer, aloe vera gel can be preserved by a combination of sodium benzoate, sodium sulphate, potassium sorbate, and ascorbic acid. But wait it gets worse: not only are you using preservatives but you’re using the WRONG ones. I couldn’t find any mascaras that use these as preservatives. You should use preservatives which have been tested and shown to safe for use around the eye such as Imidazolidinyl Urea, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, and Phenoxyethanol. You’re creating a formula that may grow dangerous bacteria. Colorants for eyes need to be tested Second, the activated charcoal you’re using is not approved as a colorant for use around the eye. The FDA requires that each batch of colorants used around the eye are certified that they comply with safety regulations. A jar of activated charcoal won’t have that safety assurance. Who knows what kind of contaminants it may contain? The Beauty Brains bottom line In conclusion let me ask which you think is safer: Purchasing a professionally formulated product with ingredients that have been shown to be safe for use around the eye and that have been tested to ensure it won’t support growth of bacteria that could potentially lead to dangerous eye infection, OR mixing two ingredients, one of which is not properly preserved and the other which is not designed to be used close to your eyes? (Whew, pardon the run on sentence!) I’m sorry, but you couldn’t pay me enough to risk an eye infection by “protecting” myself from excess chemicals.

"The Beauty Brains","2017-09-07 07:11:00","Collagenta serum: skin savior or scam? by The Beauty Brains Mdh must know… Apologies if this has already been discussed (couldn’t find a topic), but I stumbled across a free trial for Collagenta and wondered if the Beauty Brains had reviewed this product? The Beauty Brains respond: Collagenta is a mail order product line from London-based DS Marketing Ltd, the same company that markets the Dead Sea Minerals collection. Their Active Collagen Serum, which retails for $149 for what appears to be a 2 ounce container, seems to be the one offered in the free trial so let’s take a look at the key claims and the ingredients. Collagenta Serum Claims Regular use of Collagenta Active Serum helps the skin stay supple, plump and taut by supplying it with pure marine collagen, rejuvenating minerals and antioxidants. Clinical studies show that when applied twice or thrice daily for just 15 days, Collagenta will fill and smooth out wrinkles that have taken years to form. After as little as one month of regular usage, deep wrinkles, sun spots and other hard signs of ageing are dramatically reduced. Within 3 months, your skin could look 10 to 15 years younger – velvety smooth, glowing and elastic – without painful and expensive Botox injections! What do these claims really mean? If you look closely there’s nothing particularly compelling about these claims. Many other (cheaper) products will help moisturize your skin, plumping it up to reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. There are also “weasel words” included in some of the claims that make them dubious. Note the phrasing of “your skin could look 10 to 15 years younger.” The words “could look” helps soften the claim. Hey, we said your skin “could look” 15 years younger! We’re sorry that yours still looks like crap! There are some numerical claims as well. The most seemingly compelling one states that the product delivers “91% deep wrinkle reduction.” While at first glance this seems impressive, what does it really mean? It could mean that 91% of all deep wrinkles were 100% removed. But it could also mean that 91% of deep wrinkles showed SOME degree of reduction. And that degree could be 25%, 5% or less. Without these important details this claim doesn’t seem so compelling. How does it work? Unfortunately, we couldn’t find an ingredient list for this product on their website. (That is a huge red flag in our opinion. Companies should be transparent about the ingredients they use and not hide them from potential consumers.) So all we know is that the marketing copy tells us the “unique” formula includes 87 key ingredients: active marine collagen, pure honey, plant extracts, Dead Sea minerals, vitamins and powerful antioxidants.” None of these ingredients have been proven to have radical effects on the skin. Collagen, for example, is too big to penetrate anyway. All it can do it moisturize and plump up wrinkles. There’s no evidence presented here that makes us think this product works better than any other moisturizer. Collagenta Serum Scam? In addition, for what it’s worth, this product seems to have a fair number of complaints about people being over charged and not being able to get their money back. You can check it out for yourself on this Complaints Board . Let the buyer beware! The Beauty Brains bottom line Based on what we’ve seen there’s no compelling reason to spend $149 on a product like this. Even getting the free sample makes us a little nervous given the problems that others have had.","Collagenta serum: skin savior or scam?","c16acce9064f4aa9be21145b1a1e05015132626a","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2013/01/collagenta-serum-skin-savior-or-scam/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Why does sweat stink? by The Beauty Brains Which makes you stink more: a workout at the gym or a stressful meeting at the office? The answer lies in understanding that there are two different kinds of sweat. “Regular” sweat comes from the eccrine sweat glands which are activated by physical activity and environmental temperature. “Stress sweat” is produced by secretions from the eccrine and the apocrine gland. Sweat from this gland consists of 80% water and 20% nutrients which means that bacteria will grow more easily. And bacteria are the cause of odor. (Sweat itself doesn’t smell.) The bottom line is that stress sweat makes you stink more. Here’s a clever infographic animation that explains how this works in greater detail.","Why does sweat stink?","8a1ca7ef5e15cc2a06b1ce7b0106f9025a06b08f","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2012/11/why-does-sweat-stink/"
"The Beauty Brains","None","A-Revitol Hair Removal Cream – Too Good to Be True? by The Beauty Brains Rozy asks… A-Revitol hair removal creme says that it’s so gentle you can use to remove pubic hair. I know that is a very delicate area so I am skeptical. Whats the deal? The Right Brain replies: The product in question is A-Revitol Hair Removal Cream . Here’s the deal on the product claims and the likelihood that it will live up to those claims. How do hair removal creams work? All hair removal creams work essentially the same way: by using chemicals that dissolve the hair to a point where it can be wiped off. Since the hair is removed at (or just below) the surface of the skin, there’s no razor stubble so your skin feels smoother than if you had shaved. Most products use a combination of two type of ingredients to dissolve hair: a thioglycolate and a hydroxide. Is A-Revitol more gentle? Any product potent enough to dissolve hair has the potential to irritate skin but this product is formulated to be on the gentle side because it only uses one of these two ingredients we just mentioned. In this case it uses calcium hydroxide. That means it’s somewhat less likely to irritate skin but it will also be somewhat less effective at removing hair. Is A-Revitol is a better product? If you have really sensitive skin you might be better off with this product compared to a standard depilatory like Nair. However, since this product is almost 4 times the cost of Nair, you should probably try that one first to see if it works for you. (A-Revitol costs about $20 compared to $5 for Nair’s Bikini Cream.) Does the product do what it claims? The key claim that the company makes is that it’s safe enough to use anywhere, which is true enough as long as you follow their instructions to patch test it on your skin first. They are prone to some exaggeration, however. They say that A-Revitol will “get rid of hair in seconds” even though instructions tell you “leave the cream on for 12 to 15 minutes.” I guess “instant” is a relative term. The website mentions that “we sell countless numbers of these as we move toward a hair less society.” If they’re unable to count how many sales they make, they might want to fire their accounting department. And I guess I missed the official announcement about the new hairless society. The Beauty Brains bottom line A-Revitol appears to be a pretty standard hair removal product, but it might be right for you if you have really sensitive skin and you don’t mind paying a lot more.

"The Beauty Brains","","Does Avon ANEW Clinical Pro Line Eraser Really Work? by The Beauty Brains FK1221 asks… What is A-F33? According to AVON “It’s unlike AHA. Unlike Retinol. It works to deactivate collagen blocking ( what does ‘deactivate collagen blocking’ mean?) and help effectively boost collagen production in just 3 days. The look of deep wrinkles begin to fade in just one week.” What part does the ingredient Acetyl Tyrosinamide play in the formulation? The Right Brain responds: The product you’re referring to is officially known as Avon ANEW Clinical Pro Line Eraser and is new to the market as of September 2012. The magic ingredient Amino-Fill 33 is actually the Acetyl Tyrosinamide that you asked about. What does “decrease collagen blocking” mean? Our skin contains an enzyme called PLOD-2 that is partially responsible for ensuring our skin has an adequate amount of healthy collagen. As we age the production of this enzyme drops which causes collagen production to decrease. Less collagen means more lines and wrinkles. Supposedly, A-F 33 works to increase the levels of this enzyme so collagen production remains that youthfully high levels. In other words, the ingredient decreases the chemical that stops new collagen from being created. Does it really work? As always, it can be tough to separate the science from the marketing spin when it comes to anti-aging products. We haven’t been able to track down anything on this ingredient that was published in the peer-reviewed technical literature but we did find information from Avon about a poster session presented by one of their researchers at the Academy of American Dermatologists. Here is a summary of some of the key points along with our comments. In vivo testing showed that the formulation “increased the thickness of the stratum corneum…and compressional elasticity of skin.” Without being able to review the actual data it’s unclear whether the skin thickening was the result of plumping from moisturization or a more fundamental long-term structural change. It’s also impossible to tell the magnitude of the result. While the researcher noted that the results are statistically significant there is no indication of how large the improvement was. Therefore it’s impossible to tell if this product causes enough improvement to be noticeable to the average person. In vitro research showed A- F33 was shown to stimulate the production of both collagen and elastin. In vitro essentially means the testing was done on cells in a test tube not on “complete” skin on a real person. Chemicals applied directly to a solution of living cells have the opportunity to interact with those cells in ways that are much different than a product that is applied to the top of your skin. Therefore this kind of testing is directional at best. Plus, you’ll notice that the ingredient A-F33 was tested, not the finished product. So even if A-F33 works we have no way of knowing if the finished product contains enough of the ingredient to be effective. ANEW Clinical Pro Line Eraser improved “fine wrinkling, pigmentation and skin texture better than the commercial treatment.” The study notes that the ANEW product works better than a ”commercial anti-aging wrinkle treatment.” Unfortunately the reference does not disclose which anti-aging product was tested. If this product works better than a retinol containing product we might be impressed. However if the other anti-wrinkle product was simply a moisturizing lotion the results would be less meaningful. There’s no way to tell without access to the full study. The Beauty Brains bottom line We haven’t seen strong enough evidence to convince us that this product is worth its high price tag. It was would be really helpful if Avon was a little more forthcoming in the details of their testing or if they published the results in a peer-reviewed journal. Nonetheless we are a little more optimistic than all Paula Begoun’s BeautyPedia site which cranked out a scathing review of this product. Unlike many other products there seems to be at least a nugget of science behind this treatment. Try it at your own list.

"The Beauty Brains","","The Cheapest Miracle Skin Ingredient Ever? by The Beauty Brains We get a few dozen press releases for new beauty products every day, and most of them we dismiss pretty quickly because they appear to be the same old stuff repackaged with outrageous claims and a high price tag. But, we recently received one on Epsom salts which caught our eye because it provides some common sense beauty tips that also make sense technically and that can be applied VERY inexpensively. While some people may find salt too drying for their skin, we still think these tips are worth sharing, especially for the DIY fans in the crowd. (And, no, we weren’t paid off by the Epsom Salt Council of America to promote their product.) Glowing skin exfoliating treatment Mix 2 cups of Epsom Salt with 1/4 cup of petroleum jelly and a few drops of lavender essential oil. Use the mixture to gently scrub away dry skin patches. Microdermabrasion Facial Mix 1/2 TSP of Epsom Salt into cleansing cream for a deep-pore cleansing. Massage on skin. Rinse with cool water. Pat dry. (Note: I’m not crazy about this one because salt can destabilize some emulsions and may interfere with the delivery of other ingredients.) Bathtime Bliss Add two cups of Epsom Salt to the water in a standard-sized bathtub; soak for at least 12 minutes, three times weekly.

"The Beauty Brains","","What is Micellar Water? by The Beauty Brains Elana44 asks… Lately i see a lot of brands coming out with something called micellar water. What are they, what do they do to skin? How are they different from regular water or a toner we all are used to see around? What do they put in there that makes it micellar? The Right Brain responds: Wow, we thought we’d seen it all when it came to Marketing co-opting technical terms to make products sound differentiated, but this is a new one! In reality, any product that contains a detergent (aka surfactant) can said to be “micellar water.” What are micelles? Micelles are the structures that surfactants form when they reach a certain concentration in water. Think of it this way: Surfactants are little chemical bridges with one end that loves water (hydrophilic) and one end that loves oil (lipophilic). Here’s an actual electron micrograph of a surfactant molecule: Sarah Bellum says this picture reminds her of something else but I have no idea what she’s talking about. Anyway, when you dump a bunch of these molecules in water, the oil loving parts want to be close together to get away from the water. So, surfactant molecules spontaneously form these spherical blobs where the oily ends all point toward the middle of the sphere and the water loving ends all point to the outside of the sphere where the rest of the water is. That’s why surfactants are so good at dispersing oil: oil droplets can “hide” from the water in the middle of the micelle so they can be suspended or washed away. And here’s a real picture of a micelle: Once again, I point out that ANY product with surfactants will do this. It doesn’t have to be called a fancy name like “micellar water.” Is there ANYTHING different about micellar water? Faithful forum member Alchemist did a quick breakdown on the ingredients in these products. They typically contain the following: Water A Glycol (eg Hexylene Glycol, Pentylene Glycol) – acting both as a humectant and hydotrope (improves solubulity of the the makeup in the surfactant) Solubiliser (eg Polysorbate 20) – the surfactant that does the cleansing Preservative Fairy Dust Based on the examples we’ve seen it looks like most of these products use non-ionic surfactants which are very low foaming. So they’re kind of like cleansers that don’t feel like traditional cleansers. Non-ionic materials also tend to be milder than their anionic cousins which include SLS, SLES, etc. So perhaps the “hook” for these products is that they look and act more like water than a traditional high-foaming cleanser. The Beauty Brains bottom line If you’re looking for a mild, low-foam face wash, micellar water may be just the thing for you. But don’t be tricked into spending a ton of money just because of the micelles.

"The Beauty Brains","","Does NeriumAD Age Defying Treatment really work? by The Beauty Brains Fellr asks… My friend is looking at direct marketing with Nerium International. She dropped off a bottle of anti-aging cream, NeriumAD, for me to try for one week. Forever the skeptic, I am not convinced this is the savior for our aging skin. Does this product work? The Right Brain responds: Nerium’s claim to fame seems to be two proprietary ingredient blends: an oleander extract (made from a type of evergreen shrub) and a mixture of proteins (which appeared to be quite common so I’m not sure why these are exclusive.) Here is the complete ingredient list (as provided on the Nerium website ): NeriumAD Ingredients NAE-8 Proprietary Blend (Aloe Barbadensis Leaf, Nerium Oleander Leaf Extract) Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Proprietary Protein blend (Collagen, Elastin, Glycosaminoglycans) Oryza Sativa Bran Oil Stearic Acid Cetearyl Glucoside Cetearyl Alcohol Glycerin C14-22 Alcohol C12-Alkyl Glucoside Glyceryl Stearate Ricinus Communis Seed Oil Cetyl Alcohol Olus Oil Chondrus Crispus Powder Sodium Borate Dicaprylyl Ether Hydrolyzed Quinoa Sodium Isostearoyl Lactylate Dimethicone Sodium PCA Proprietary Blend (Caprylyl Glycol, Glycerin, Glyceryl Caprylate, Phenylpropanol) Parfum Sodium Hydroxymethylglycinate Tocopherol Note: This is how the ingredients appears on their website but they don’t seem to be listed correctly in order of concentration because, according to their clinical study (see below) the NAE -8 blend is only used at 0.0117%. Therefore it would NOT appear at the top of the list. What is NeriumAD supposed to do? According to their website they have done clinical testing to prove their product dramatically reduces the appearance of… Fine Lines and Wrinkles Hyperpigmentation Uneven Skin Texture Enlarged Pores Aging or Sun-Damaged Skin These are fairly standard claims made by many products on the market. What do their test results show? According to their clinical test report , they used impressive methodology involving state of the art wrinkle tracking imaging equipment and software. But we’re a bit perplexed by how this methodology satisfies the objective of the study. The report indicates that “Ingredients that may provide additional efficacy are sought to improve existing products” and that the purpose of the study was to investigate “the safety and efficacy of two such ingredients….Nerium oleander extract and proprietary protein blend.” Given this objective, we’d expect the test to be done comparing a lotion containing the “new” ingredients to a control that does NOT contain them. That comparison is the only way to ensure that the ingredients are responsible for any benefits that the product provides as opposed to other ingredients in the formula. However, it appears that the test was done without a control. In other words they only evaluated a lotion containing the test ingredients. So not only can we not distinguish the effects of the ingredients from the effects of the lotion base but we also can’t tell if there were other factors that caused improvement. For example, did the skin show improvement from sun damage because the panelists had less sun exposure for the duration of the test? The only way to know for sure would have been to test the product against an untreated face (either by adding panelists to the study or doing some kind of half-face test.) What does all this mean? You asked if this product works. We have little doubt that this product, like many others, will help reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. However there’s no information here to indicate that this product works better than other less expensive products. If their test results showed dramatic improvement versus a ”regular” skin lotion we would have been more impressed. But as they stand, the data does not justify the rather exorbitant cost of the product ($110 for 1 ounce.) The Beauty Brains bottom line The information provide by Nerium doesn’t convince us that this product is worth the cost.","Does NeriumAD Age Defying Treatment really work?","5b6f7d3f7c54422639638f535500c423c44907da","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2012/06/does-neriumad-age-defying-treatment-really-work/"
"The Beauty Brains","2014-11-06 11:43:00","Does Vaseline Darken Lips? by The Beauty Brains Janelle says… Hi Beauty Brains! Let me start off my expressing how much I love your website! It’s informative, interesting, and best of all…SCIENTIFIC!! I am a college student, and love the last point! My question is, does Vaseline darken lips? I’ve always used it on my lips before I go to bed, but my roommate tells me that it darkens lips because it can be used to get a greater tan – as it is like an oil. Many people are adding their own anecdotal evidence about how it has darkened their lips – but I don’t know what to think! As it is, I have moderately dark lips. Is there any scientific proof? Please help! And many thanks! The Right Brain responds: Thanks for the kind words, Janelle! Vaseline is essentially petrolatum (which is closely related to mineral oil) so it’s reasonable to assume that they might work the same way. But we were surprised to find very little research on the effect of tanning oils on skin. (We did find studies on tanning accelerators like L-tyrosine but that’s a story for another day…) Still, after much searching, we did find one reputable source that should definitively answer your question. Why does oil make you tan better? Everyone seems to know that rubbing baby oil (aka mineral oil) on your skin will make you tan faster and deeper. Many articles claim that mineral oil “attracts” UV rays. But WHY is that? What’s really happening? According to a paper we found in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology, mineral oil (and similar lubricants) are used to in the photo-therapy treatment of psoriasis to enhance the effects of UVB treatment. Apparently the mineral oil smooths scaly skin and decreases the amount of UV radiation that is reflected. Less reflection means skin absorbs MORE UVB rays. And since UVB rays are responsible for tanning, the skin gets darker. That must be how tanning oils work! Remember, though, that your lips don’t tan. So if you’re asking about the actual lips themselves, this won’t work. But, if you’re asking about the skin of your upper lip, yes, it is very possible that putting Vaseline petroleum jelly on it will make it get darker (after exposure to sun.)

"The Beauty Brains","None","What’s the best way to apply coconut oil to hair? by The Beauty Brains CYW says… Is using coconut oil as a pre-poo or a leave in after shampoo/cond going to benefit my hair the most? The Right Brain responds: We’ve blogged before about how coconut oil is effective at treating hair damage . That’s because it’s one of the relatively few oils that are able to penetrate deep into the hair. Coconut oil is special because it has the right combination of molecular size and shape (it’s small and has straight line structure that allows it to slip into hair) and the right chemical structure (it’s derived from lauric acid which has an affinity for protein.) So while most conditioning oils (like silicones and mineral oil) just sit on top of that hair, coconut oil is literally able to work from the inside. What’s the best way to apply coconut oil? One of the best studies we’ve seen on this subject was conducted in India is in 2002. Researchers found that coconut oil reduces damage both as a pre-wash and post grooming treatment. However, results showed it worked better as a prewash which makes sense since that’s when a lot of mechanical damage occurs during the washing and drying process. Does this sound too good to be true? Well there is a slight catch, at least based on the methodology used in this particular test. The coconut oil was applied to hair and allowed to soak in for 14 hours (overnight). Despite the usage instructions for many regular conditioners you don’t have to let those sit on your hair for very long. However, if you want good penetration (and who doesn’t?) you have to allow coconut oil to soak into your hair for quite some time. Maybe 14 hours isn’t the magic number but that’s the timeframe that researchers used in this study. The Beauty Brains bottom line We wouldn’t want to over emphasize the results of any single study, however, based on the research we’ve seen you should apply coconut oil to your hair at night before going to sleep. In the morning wash it out with a shampoo like Phique and you should see significantly less damage.

"The Beauty Brains","","Can baking soda make shampoo work better? by The Beauty Brains Bella begs to know… I recently read on Eco-Chick and a couple of other places that adding a little baking soda to shampoo can help get rid of styling residue and other gunk in your hair. How does this work? Is it safe for hair? The Right Brain responds: Adding baking soda to shampoo is a very persistent beauty myth. Using baking soda as a shampoo substitute (i.e., as a dry shampoo) does make some sense because the powder can absorb oil and some surface dirt. But will adding baking soda to shampoo really result in better cleansing? There are three potential reasons why this might work: 3 Ways Baking Soda MIGHT Clean Your Hair Enhanced detergency Detergents, which belong to a chemical classification known as surfactants, work because they have both oil and water soluble properties. Baking soda, on the other hand, is a water soluble salt which doesn’t really have provide any detergency. You can easily demonstrate this by dissolving some in water and adding a drop of oil. If the baking soda was good at washing away oil it would disperse the oil droplet. (But it doesn’t.) Increased abrasion If you had some very insoluble substance stuck in your hair that shampoo would not remove, like chewing gum, the gritty texture of baking soda might help physically abrade it. But for the common types of soil that you will find in your hair (sebum and styling residue) you don’t need this increased abrasion. Raising the pH to dissolve styling residue At first glance this approach potentially makes the most sense. Styling polymers are neutralized with acid to make them less water-soluble (that’s why they can hold your hair in high humidity.) One way to get rid of styling gunk is to make it more soluble by raising the pH. Since the pH of a baking soda solution is about 9 this could work, right? That, as they say, is a testable proposition. So we added a 1/8 teaspoon of baking soda to 1/2 ounce of the shampoo we’re currently testing (the new Mark Anthony Oil of Morocco Argan Oil shampoo.) Then we measured the pH using litmus strips. As you can see from the strip on the left, the initial pH is pretty close to 7 which is neutral. After adding a good slug of baking soda the pH strip turned slightly darker. The lighting in the picture makes it hard to tell, but it looks like it went up to about 8 or 8.5. Unfortunately, this much of a pH increase won’t provide much cleaning boost to the shampoo because baking soda is a weak base and it won’t do a very good job of neutralizing the weak acids present in the styling resins. The Beauty Brains bottom line While adding baking soda to your shampoo won’t hurt your hair it also won’t help much. So if you like to do this and you think it gives you a little bit of an edge in cleaning power go for it. But, if you’re going to run out and buy a 50 gallon barrel of baking soda just because you think it’s critical for clean hair. then save your money.

"The Beauty Brains","","Nair Brazilian Spa Clay: In the Beauty Brains Bathroom by The Beauty Brains We received the following Nair products to evaluate so Sarah Bellum and I teamed up to give this review. New from Nair Nair Brazilian Spa Clay Shower Power Hair Removal Cream Depilatory for legs and body that removes hair while you shower using Nair Shower Power technology Nair Brazilian Spa Clay Roll-On Wax Water rinseable sugar wax for legs and body equipped with reusable cloth strips that are gentle to remove Nair Precision Face Roll-On Wax Kit Mistake-proof water rinseable sugar wax with white lily in a roll-on format Hair removing technology The first product uses standard depilation technology: a high pH mixture of calcium thioglycolate and sodium hydroxide. This combination swells the hair and weakens down the protein bonds so the hair is easily broken off. Nair Brazilian Spa Clay Shower Power Hair Removal Cream Ingredients Aqua, Paraffinum Liquidum, Calcium Thioglycolate , Cetearyl Alcohol, Calcium Hydroxide, Ceteareth-20, Sodium Hydroxide , Illite, Parfum, Silica, Mangifera Indica Seed Oil, Glycerin Euterpe Oleracea Fruit Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Citric Acid, Benzyl, Salicylate, Hexyl Cinnamal, ButylPhenyl MethylPropional, Limonene, Linalool, Geraniol, CI 77891 The other two products use a novel sugar-based approach. These are really epilators (i.e. they pull the hairs out rather than chemically destroying them.) Epilation is typically done by waxing but these formulas are difficult to handle because they must used at high temperatures and they can overly sticky. Nair’s approach is to use a sugar-startch combination that doesn’t require as much heat and doesn’t get as sticky. Interestingly, even though both products have “wax” in their name they don’t not contain any real wax. It look like they’re describing the mixture as a “sugar-wax.” Nair Brazilian Spa Clay Roll-On Wax Ingredients Hydrolyzed Corn Starch, Sucrose, Glucose, Glycerin, Citric Acid, Water, Fragrance, Ci 77891 (Titanium Dioxide), Propylene Glycol, Honey Extract, Pentylene Glycol, Peg-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Trideceth-9, Nonfat Dry Milk. Nair Precision Face Roll-On Wax Kit Ingredients Sucrose, Hydrolyzed Corn Starch, Water, Citric Acid, Butylene Glycol, Lilium Candidum Bulb Extract. Do these new Nair products really work? We’re skeptical that sugar solution could have adequate cohesive strength to remove hair , so gave these products to Sarah Bellum, the hairiest of all the Beauty Brains, to test them out. Here’s what she found: You tell everyone that I’m the hairiest Beauty Brain??? And people wonder why we feud ! Anyway, I have to tell you that I was not thrilled with the way these products worked for me. I have them a torture test by letting my leg hair grow out for a few days. The shower product (with the calcium thio stuff) did work but it left some patches of hair untouched, even after leaving it on for 4 minutes. (You can see all untouched hair in the first picture.) So I still had to shave. It did leave my skin feeling really soft and smooth, which I liked. I think this one might be better suited for a small area like the lip for the bikini area, but not for legs. Or, maybe it could be good for touchups in between shaving. The sugar based products were useless in my opinion. I couldn’t get them to pull ANY hair off my lip or any where else. (See the cloth strips in the second picture.) It just didn’t feel sticky enough. Not cohesive enough, like Righty said. Or was that adhesive? Anyway, I’m not a big fan of these two products even though I wanted to like them because the packaging was so cool.

"The Beauty Brains","","Dove Clear Tone Antiperspirant: In the Beauty Brains Bathroom by The Beauty Brains One of our most popular posts is about the top 5 causes of darkened armpits . It’s amazing how many women have this problem! As we explained in that post, one of the 5 causes is from shaving. Now the research and development team at Unilever’s Dove brand have developed a new antiperspirant that is designed to reduce dark marks under your arms caused by shaving. How Dove Clear Tone works Here’s how Dove explains it works: when skin is damaged by shaving the body responds with increased blood flow to the damaged area. Part of this response includes increased production of melanin, the same brownish-red pigment that gives your skin a tan color. This extra melanin is extra responsible for the dark marks in your pits. By adding extra conditioning agents to the formula, this new Dove product is supposedly able to reduce the effects of shaving irritation and therefore reduce dark marks from forming. This technical explanation was improvised by the Public Relations firm for Dove and was very helpful. However, we haven’t seen any reference to test data showing how well the product really works. The Beauty Brains bottom line Theoretically, this product can reduce dark marks caused by shaving. It also feels nice, smells great, and it’s not expensive.So, if you have a problem with dark armpits and you suspect shaving is the cause, you don’t have much to lose by giving this product try.

"Perry Romanowski","","Can Soap Really Kill Germs? by Perry Romanowski Mitte must know… I often get contact dermatitis on my hands from soaps (liquid, soapbars or even the “mild” ones). I understand a good hygiene is necessary to prevent spreading of bacteria and virus, but how effective is really soap (surfectants) when it comes to killing germs in the first place? Is there an effective alternative that is not so irritating/dehydrating? In other words, what surfectant is the mildest on the market and does it work on germs? The Beauty Brains respond: A quick literature review, courtesy of PubMed, should help answer your question. Do you need soap? According to a research paper entitled “The effect of handwashing with water or soap on bacterial contamination of hands” water alone won’t cut it (at least not for bacteria of faecal origin.) The researchers found that not washing hands resulted in a 44% contamination rate. Washing with water alone dropped the contamination level to 23% and washing with non-antibacterial soap showed only 8% contamination. So clearly, even regular soap is much better than rinsing with water alone. (Ref. 1) Do you need antibacterial soap? Okay, so you do need to use soap to control bacteria. But do you need special antibacterial soap? Another study found that that “although differences in efficacy between antimicrobial and nonantimicrobial soap were small, antimicrobial soap produced consistently statistically significantly greater reductions” (Ref. 2) When it comes to keeping your hands free from bacteria it looks like soap is a MUST have and antibacterial soap is a NICE to have. What’s the mildest? If surfactant mildness is your concern, look for a hand soap (ok, actually it’s detergent, not soap) based on an ingredient called “Sodium Cocoyl Isthionate (or SCI for short). This is one of (if not the) mildest surfactant on the market. We’ve blogged before how it’s used in the mildest body washes and shampoos. You can use hand santiziers but those are often alcohol based and they may be drying to your skin. References: 1. Int J Environ Res Public Health. 2011 Jan;8(1):97-104. Epub 2011 Jan 6.

"Randy Schueller","","The top 5 causes of darkened armpits by Randy Schueller Germaine Pie Is Puzzled By Her Pits: What causes darkened armpits and what can we do to get rid of them? They’re so embarrassing! The Right Brain Raises Her From the Pit of Despair: It’s not surprising that so many people have this problem – there are at least FIVE different reasons your pits could be darker than they should be. Reduce darkened armpits Cause #1: Shaving. When you shave you cut the hairs off at, or just below, the surface of the skin. If your hairs are slightly darker than your skin color, they can give the appearance that your skin has a dark stain when it`s really just sub-surface hair. What To Do About It: Stop shaving and try waxing or plucking instead so you get rid of the hair below the skin surface. Since the hairs aren’t lurking so close to the top of your skin, they won’t be as visible. Cause #2: Buildup of dead skin cells. According to at least one dermatologist, dark spots under your arms are the result of dead skin cells that are trapped in microscopic “hills and valleys” on your skin. What To Do About It: Exfoliate, preferably with a product containing lactic acid. Cause #3: Antiperspirant and deodorant usage. In theory, some ingredients in these products (perhaps the fragrance) could be reacting with the skin to cause discoloration. Practically speaking this seems unlikely but many people do claim that when they stop using APDs, the darkness goes away. What To Do About It: Try switching brands or using a deodorant instead of an antiperspirant. You may stink a bit more, but hey, the Left Brain lives for experiments like that! Cause #4: A medical condition called acanthosis nigricans . This condition causes light-brown-to-black markings on the neck, under the arms, or in the groin. It can be related to insulin production or to a glandular disorder and it typically occurs in people who are overweight. What To Do About It: Watch your diet to control insulin production and use Retin-A, 20% urea, alpha hydroxyacids, and salicylic acid prescriptions to lighten your armpits. Cause #5: Hyper-pigmentation. This condition causes your skin to produce excess melanin pigment. It doesn’t usually affect armpits, so it’s a less likely cause. What To Do About It: Use a skin bleaching cream to destroy the excess melanin. The Beauty Brains don’t recommend this unless you consult a dermatologist first. You can also try laser treatment to destroy the pigment.","The top 5 causes of darkened armpits","cfec77174563d164594ff4b8bc22965aad3dcb07","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2006/12/the-top-5-causes-of-darkened-armpits/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Why is Lancome more expensive than l’oreal? by The Beauty Brains Shelley Ann Asks… If L’Oreal ownes Lancome, why the heck is the price difference SO high? I recently received a foundation sample from Lancome and absolutely loved it. I went to the Lancome counter at Macys. . . the 0.85 oz full size product was $35.00. Yikes! The sales gal told me in France L’Oreal was at the department stores behind the counters and Lancome products were sold at France’s Walmarts, Target’s, and Walgreen stores. So what is up with this? The Right Brain responds: We can think of at least four different reasons why two different brands by the same company would be priced differently. Reason 1: Higher quality = more expensive In some cases there really is a difference in quality between brands that just justifies a different price.F or example, the Alberto Culver company used to make both VO5 shampoo and Tresemme shampoo. Tresemme shampoo was more expensive because it used richer surfactants and it more contained conditioning agents. The difference in performance justified a price difference. On the other hand, we also know for a fact that large companies share formulations across different brands. In that case there may be low and high cost products using the exact same formula. When that happens the difference is based on pure marketing because the parent company wants one of the brands to be more prestige. The marketing position may vary across different regions like your example of L’Oreal being sold at Walmart in France. (By the way is it just me or is the idea of Walmart in France really funny? Also we’re pretty sure that if there was a Target store in France it would be pronounced “Tar-zhay.” Anyway, the only way to tell for sure if the same formula is used across different products is to compare the ingredient list side-by-side. If you have any specific products you’re interested in we would glad to review them for you, just leave a note in the comment section. Reason 2: More fashionable color choices = more expensive Even though the basic chemistry may be the same, companies do charge more for brands with more fashionable colors. (At least in the case of color cosmetics.) For example we’ve heard that the color choices between L’Oreal and Lancome are different and that may be driving the difference in price. Reason 3: More elaborate packaging = more expensive A large part of the expense of any cosmetic product is the package. So, if Lancome uses more colors of ink, more expensive dispensing mechanisms, or even higher-priced design elements (like metallic accents) that could drive its price higher than the comparable L’Oreal product. Reason 4: More marketing = more expensive Of course it could be all these things combined with marketing that accounts for price differences between the ads. More advertising, promotions, celebrity spokespersons all add into the selling price a brand. The Beauty Brains bottom line What’s in the formula is only one small factor in determining the selling prices of a beauty product. The magical manipulations of marketers has a much greater effect.","Why is Lancome more expensive than l’oreal?","48e80bec4c3ea13043931431866581cd131e5e11","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2012/03/why-is-lancome-more-expensive-than-loreal/"
"The Beauty Brains","None","Do Skin Lotions Work Better if You Pat Instead of Rub? by The Beauty Brains Calla Lily asks… I’ve always wondered if there is legitimacy to Clarins’ claim that by patting their product into your skin, it works better and you skin absorbs it better than rubbing it in. Is this really true? If so, what about all other skincare products out there? Should we be patting instead of rubbing? The Right Brain responds: We’re not familiar with this particular Clarins product but the notion that lotion will be absorbed better if you pat it on instead of rubbing it on makes no sense. While patting your face may increase blood flow, blood circulation doesn’t play a role in the absorption process because ingredients penetrate the upper layers of skin by diffusing through the channels between skin cells and not by absorption through blood vessels. A dermatologist discusses skin penetration Rather than rely on our knowledge of chemistry to answer this one we decided to consult Dr. Cynthia Bailey M.D., a dermatologist who runs her own blog. Here’s what Dr. Bailey had to say in response to the question: Hmm, I had to ponder just what might have led Clarins to this idea, and I’m stumped. You see, the outer dead cell layer of the skin (called the stratum corneum) is THE single, main protective barrier for our skin. Once something gets through the stratum corneum it has a free ride into the rest of the skin, but getting through the stratum corneum is no easy feat – and the act of rubbing or patting is inconsequential. To put it in perspective, if it wasn’t for the strength of this huge (like biggest organ in the body sort of huge) barrier all our important body stuff would be leaching out from our skin all day long, and every substance we came into contact would enter. The integrity of this barrier is a big deal for our health, and it takes more than patting or rubbing to impact it. To breach the stratum corneum you need to assault it with tactics like a facial acid peel that dissolves it entirely, laser vaporization where it goes up in smoke, repetitive stripping with tape until you’ve pulled it all off (anyone who has had hair removal waxing knows what I mean), or severe irritation that disrupts the components of the stratum corneum rendering it defective (think dish pan hands). When we apply skin care products, by either rubbing or patting, our skin care products sloooowly penetrate our stratum corneum by gradually seeping in (a process called diffusion). Again, whether we pat or rub, they aren’t going to get through any faster than the stratum corneum will let them. If you’d like to learn more from Dr. Bailey you can find her at Drbaileyskincare.com . The Beauty Brains bottom line Patting on lotion instead of rubbing will not make the product penetrate your skin any differently. If Clarins has any data to the contrary, we’d be glad to review it in a future post.

"The Beauty Brains","","Moroccan oil hair treatment: look at the label by The Beauty Brains Another look at a top selling Amazon.com beauty product… Moroccan Oil Hair Treatment has been in the top 100 Amazon.com beauty products for almost two years! (It’s currently ranked as the 17th best seller.) It’s obvious that people really love this product; let’s look at the label to see exactly what it is they like so much. (Hint: it doesn’t actually have anything to do with Morocco.) Moroccan Oil Hair Treatment ingredients Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone, Cyclomethicone These three silicones are what make this product work (as opposed to the small amount of argan oil that it contains.) The “cyclo” ‘cones are volatile which means they evaporate. They are used as a carrier for dimethicone which is what is really smoothing and conditioning your hair. The cyclo’s distribute easily through your hair, depositing a thin coating of dimethicone. Then *poof* they disappear. There are many other hair treatments that use similar ingredients so you can find cheaper products that do the same thing as Moroccan Oil. Butylphenyl Methyl Propional This is a little sneaky: this ingredient is really the primary fragrance in the product. By listing this ingredient by its chemical name and by listing a “fragrance supplement” lower in the ingredients (see below) I guess it makes this product look like its fragrance free. I’m not really sure why they would list it this way. Argania Spinoza Kernel Oil (Aragan Oil) This is the “magic” ingredient that this product is famous for (and named after) but it’s used at very low levels. Linseed (Linum Usitatissimum) Extract I’m not sure why they added this additional extract. It won’t add any benefit at low levels. Fragrance Supplement Again with the sneakiness. D & C Yellow 11, D & C Red 17 These dyes are added to give the product a golden color so it looks more like “real” Argan oil. (The silicones which make up the bulk of the product have no color.) Coumarin, Benzyl Benzoate, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone These chemicals are listed because they are known allergens that are contained in the fragrance.

The Right Brain responds: This question has come up in one form or another several times over the last few years.

Using a straw The squeezing of skin that results from puckering can result in permanent wrinkles. Sleeping on your face In previous posts we’ve been skeptical of the effect of silk pillow cases on wrinkles . But Dr. Wu suggests sleeping on silk or satin to reduce wrinkle-causing friction.

"The Beauty Brains","2016-12-28 08:15:00","How can I test my hair porosity? by The Beauty Brains Today’s link love question comes from Life with Baby J . Amma asks… Is there a way to test porosity of your hair? The Left Brain responds: Amma, thanks for taking time to comment on our blog. Before I tell you how to test porosity, let me explain why it’s an important concept in hair care. Why should you care about porous hair? Porosity is an indicator of how damaged your hair is. The “pores” are really tiny cracks in the protein structure that weaken hair’s natural defenses. Porous hair has increased moisture loss, lower natural lipid content, and is more prone to breakage and split ends. Porosity is dramatically increased by chemical processing. A 2008 study by Nalco Chemical company showed that even just one minute exposure to hair bleach caused significant number of pores to open in the hair. To accurately measure porosity requires sophisticated testing equipment (the study cited above used nitrogen sorption using a Quantachrome Autosorb-lC instrument.) Most people don’t have one of those laying around the house, but there is a quick and dirty test you can do yourself. Hair porosity test You’ll need a glass container at least 6 inches tall and a few inches wide. Fill the container almost to the top with tap water and let it sit undisturbed until it reaches room temperature. While you’re waiting, pluck a clean hair from your head. Then, very gently lay the hair on top of the water. Look at the glass container from the side and watch the hair to see how it sinks. If your hair is in virgin condition it will float for a long time. If it’s very porous it will start to sink right away. The higher the porosity, the faster it will sink. This test gives you a very rough approximation of how damaged your hair is. What to do about porous hair Once hair becomes porous, there’s not much you can to to physically reverse the damage. However, using a good conditioner can provide temporary relief. (In fact, you can do the water drop test on strands of hair with and without conditioner to see the difference.) I like to recommend dimethicone-containing conditioners because they provide effective water proofing to hair.

The Right Brain responds: This is a great question because one of our favorite pet peeves are all the products that claim to repair hair but don’t. When you actually look at the science behind those products you find that they are almost always “regular” conditioners. That means they are very good at smoothing the cuticle and helping to prevent future damage but the do nothing to truly repair hair. Does any hair repair product really work? There is hope, however, because of new one technology that works differently. This technology is based on a polyelectrolyte complex, or PEC for short. This PEC complex consists of a negatively charged ion (PVM/MA copolymer) and a positively charged ion (Polyquaternium-28.) This combination of positive and negative charges creates a single complex with the unique ability to stick to damage hairs and to itself. How does PEC technology repair hair? What does all this mean? Well, instead of just coating the outside of hair like most conditioners do, the tiny PEC molecules are able to enter the split ends of hair. Because the complex can stick to the damaged hair protein and to other complex molecules, it creates little bridges across the open ends of the splits. As your hair dries, the water evaporates from the complex causing it to contract. The force of this contraction pulls the end of the split hairs back together again. Once the PECs are dry they bind the split end shut. Watch this video to see what happens when a drop of PEC complex is placed on a split end and dried with a blow dryer: Which products contain PEC technology? Nexxus, Joico, and Tresemme all make products containing the Polyelectrolyte Complex.

"The Beauty Brains","2015-08-17 06:45:00","Are silk pillowcases good for your skin? by The Beauty Brains Stephanie says: Is it true that it is better for your skin to sleep on silk pillow cases ? The Left Brain believes: There is some evidence, like this Pubmed article , that indicates special silk clothing can reduce atopic dermatitis in children who are prone to that condition. However, I have can’t find any evidence that sleeping on silk pillowcases is really better for your skin. Nonetheless, one brand, Silkskin Antiwrinkle Pillowcases , says they actually fight the signs of aging. Here are a few claims from their website followed by my comments: 1. Gives your skin the chance to breathe naturally While your skin does perspire and while certain chemicals can clog your pores and cause acne, skin does not really “breathe” so silk doesn’t really make a difference in this regard. 2. Because moisture levels are being maintained throughout the night, deeper lines and wrinkles are not forming. Moisture loss causes dry scaly skin, not wrinkles. A pillow case can not stop wrinkles from forming. 3. Different from run of the mill silk pillow case as it is made from organic silk which contains amino acids, the building blocks of your skin. ALL silk is made of amino acids, so the fact that this silk is organic is completely irrelevant. And the amino acid profile of silk is different than keratin protein, which is what skin is made of. And, even if it were the same, it’s not like the amino acids leap off the pillowcase and attach to your skin. 4. Organic silk also has the same pH balance of your skin. Measuring pH really only makes sense when you’re talking about a water solution. Yes, skin has a optimal pH balance, but the pH of fabric you’re sleeping on is really irrelevant. 5. When sleeping on this pillowcase, your night cream is fully absorbed by the skin and won’t rub off like it usually does, therefore allowing the cream to work to maximum effect. I’m curious if Silkskin has any actual data to back up this claim. I suppose it’s possible that silk is less absorbent than cotton, which means it could absorb less oils and moisture from the surface of your skin. But even if silk is less absorbent, just the friction of your skin against the fabric as you move around in your sleep is still enough to wipe some of the lotion off your face. Without some kind of test data to show Silkskin has a beneficial effect, I’m skeptical on this claim. 6. Silk stops you getting the dreaded ‘bedhead’ as your hair will simply glide over the pillowcase. Bed head isn’t just caused by rubbing your hair across the fabric of the pillow. It’s also caused by the warmth and moisture of your perspiring scalp saturating your hair and reforming the hydrogen bonds (also known as salt bonds) in your hair, which results in the bizarre hair configuration you wake up with. Since silk doesn’t stop you from perspiring, it probably has little effect on bed head. But once again, if there’s test data to the contrary I’ll gladly reconsider my position. 7. Dust mites cannot live on silk so the pillowcase is excellent for allergy sufferers. This is the most intriguing of all Silkskin’s claims. While I found references to very tightly woven pillowcases being used to prevent dust mites from penetrating into pillows, I could not find any legitimate scientific source that answered this question one way or the other. The Beauty Brains bottom line: There may be some legitimate benefits to sleeping on silk, but Silkskin makes a number of definitive claims without providing much information to back them up. Maybe it’s true that dust mites can’t live on silk, but I’d rather not take the word of the company trying to sell me the product as proof. A little independent confirmation would go a long way toward making me feel better about buying this product.","Are silk pillowcases good for your skin?","190c86d7c2f61062496b70b78c1d9c8fc98a6e5c","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2008/02/are-silk-pillowcases-good-for-your-skin/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Can honey lighten hair? by The Beauty Brains LeahSierra says… There’s a video on Youtube by Andrea’s Choice . She used honey to lighten up her hair. I haven’t tried but you can watch the video. The Left Brain responds: Thanks, Leah, for the link to this video. In it, Andrea explains how mixing honey (either raw or regular) with either olive oil and banana or with just your regular conditioner can lighten hair. She claims the honey contains peroxide that can bleach hair over time. But does this really work? Hair lightening science It’s true that honey contains peroxide. More accurately it contains an enzyme, glucose oxidase, that can produce peroxide. But keep in mind that peroxide is only an effective bleaching agent at the right concentration and at the right pH. Concentration: how much peroxide is in honey? How much peroxide do you need to lighten hair? To fully bleach hair it takes a solution of peroxide at a concentration of 6%; 3% can be used over time to gradually lighten hair. Glucose oxidase in honey can react to release peroxide under the right conditions. (It’s also important to note that only raw honey contains this active enzyme.) When honey is diluted with water, the enzyme can produce about 1 milimole of peroxide per liter which is about 1000 times less than the 3% solution required to bleach hair. This is far too little to have a significant effect on your hair. Okay, but just for the sake of argument let’s say that you used a LOT of honey on your hair. Would it work then? Only if the pH was right. The pH required for bleaching hair Peroxide solutions must be “activated” by increasing the pH because peroxide is not very reactive at pH below 4. Typically, peroxide is mixed with ammonia because it has a very high pH. The pH of honey is between 3.2 and 4.5 which is far below the range required for effective hair bleaching. What about Andrea’s tip about mixing honey with conditioner? Would that make it work better? Well, the pH of conditioner is in the 4-5 range (conditioners work better on the acid side because it protonates or increases the positive charge of the goodies that stick to your hair. So even mixed with conditioner the pH is still to low be effective. The Beauty Brains bottom line IF you use the right kind of honey and IF the enzyme is still active and IF you dilute it properly and IF get it to the right pH and IF you get it on your hair before it’s used up by reaction with the rest of the organic stuff in the mixture. then you’ll STILL have only about 1/1000 of the amount you need to lighten your hair. I guess just because Winnie the Pooh was blonde doesn’t mean that honey can lighten your hair.

"The Beauty Brains","","Neutrogena Mineral Sheers Powder Foundation Review by The Beauty Brains From The Beauty Brains Forum Member: Pas71 I have really oily skin and live in a humid climate, so I was super excited to have the chance to review Neutrogena’s Mineral Sheers Powder Foundation . Not only does it come with lots of great “extras” (SPF 20, time-released anti-oxidants, and the claim that it is actually good for your skin), but it also seemed to be the perfect product for me. I was thinking that it would be a great for providing enough coverage to hide my trouble spots while combating my skin’s natural oiliness, which is, of course, exacerbated by humid weather. Unfortunately, it was not quite the miracle product I was hoping for. Feeling flaky First, any flakiness you have will be extremely noticeable when using this product. I don’t usually notice flakiness with my oily skin, but I do get it at times because I use such strong anti-acne products. However, when using a liquid foundation, the flakiness is usually concealed… not so with powder foundations. The first time I used this product (on top of a moisturizer and primer, mind you), my face was a mess! All you could see was what looked like dry, flaky skin. The product and its somewhat rough sponge applicator flaked my skin all over. So, I immediately washed it off and exfoliated my face the best I could. I then tried the product again with better results. If you decide to try it, please be sure to exfoliate well before using! Tiny texture Second, it seems the texture of the powder is not fine enough. After applying what I needed to give me a bit of coverage, the powder was very noticeable on my face. This was solved by taking a big fluffy brush and basically buffing it out. However, I was then left with less coverage than I was hoping for and far less coverage than I would get with my semi-sheer liquid foundation. Questionable coverage Which brings me to my next point: the level of coverage. Though Neutrogena claims that the product is build able to the desired level of coverage, it is not. If you put more than a sheer dusting on, the texture of the powder is far too noticeable. And, the sheer dusting doesn’t do a whole lot for skin like mine that needs some coverage. I did get better results when using a liquid concealer on problem areas prior to putting on the mineral foundation, but I still did not get the even-looking result that I do with liquid foundation. As for oil control, this product actually passes my high standards. When using this with a light moisturizer and my foundation primer, I found my skin to be far less oily than normal, even in the humidity! I hardly needed to blot my face while wearing this, which is definitely a plus in my book. Overall, I really can’t see a difference between this product and a regular pressed powder. In fact, that is what I’ve decided to use it as and it’s doing quite well controlling the shininess in my T-zone that I am used to getting by 10am. In sum, I would recommend this product for someone who doesn’t need too much coverage and whose skin is not particularly dry. What do you think about about mineral foundations?

"The Beauty Brains","","Is Grape Seed Oil Good for Protecting Hair from Heat? by The Beauty Brains Lilypad asks… I’m transitioning from relaxed to natural hair and a lot of blogs and video bloggers tout grape seed oil as a heat protectant when blowdrying or flat ironing hair because it has a high smoke point (about 420 °F). Is there any truth to this claim? The smoke point refers to the oil’s use in cooking but does it apply to hair as well? The Right Brain responds: We’ve blogged before about how to protect your hair from heat damage and there’s more to it than just the how much heat the ingredients can take. What to look for in a good heat protectant Heat tolerance (in this case measured by smoke point of the oil) is only one factor to consider. You also need to look at how the product lubricates hair. You can experiment with oils if you want DIY heat protection but be careful: oils alone can create drag which could slow down the flat iron as it passes through your hair so it could end up doing MORE damage. Good heat protectants should also help offset the drying effects of heat. Ideally you want a combination of glycerine or other moisturizers to lock in water and a low molecular weight polymer that can penetrate and help prevent heat from cracking the cuticles. (See the link above more more discussion and scientific references.) Which oils can stand a lot of heat But back to your question about smoke point. This site lists grape seed at 485F with soy bean oil at 495F, safflower oil at 510F, and avocado oil at a startling 520F! Wikipedia lists slightly different values: Cottonseed and virgin olive oil are in the same range as grape seed while almond, peanut, sunflower, and our cold friend coconut oil are higher. We’re not sure which values are more accurate, but either way it looks like you have some options to try that offer an even higher smoke point than grape seeds.

"The Beauty Brains","2014-02-01 13:08:00","Can canola oil condition skin? by The Beauty Brains Alex asks: I read that Canola Oil is a very good skin moisturizer because it contains a lot of alpha hydroxy acids. I’ve tried it and I think it makes my skin feel softer. Can you explain why Canola oil is good for skin? Thanks a bunch! The Right Brain responds: Before we talk about its benefits, we’ll explain why Canola is one of the most controversial of all the vegetable cooking oils. What is Canola oil? As you might guess, Canola oil comes from the seeds of the Canola plant. You might guess that, but you’d be WRONG. Canola oil actually comes from the rapeseed plant. For some strange reason, women didn’t seem inclined to buy a product called “Rape Oil,” so in the late 1970s, Canadian rapeseed growers renamed their product Canola, which is an abbreviation for “Canadian Oil, Low Acid.” Voila, sales of Canola oil took off. Then, disaster struck a few years later when Canola oil was hit with more bad press: it was found to cause glaucoma and Mad Cow Disease. Psych! That connection actually turned out to be just an urban myth . So despite a rocky start, Canola oil finally established itself as a popular cooking oil. Can Canola condition skin? Ok, so it’s good to cook with, but is it good for skin? The answer is yes, no, and maybe. First of all, whatever benefit Canola has on skin, it’s unlikely to be related to alphahydroxy acids. In fact, we can’t find any reference to alpha hydroxy acids in Canola, which makes sense since those acids are water soluble and generally come from fruits. (If you’ve seen any credible sources that say something different, let us know and we’ll check them out.) Instead of AHAs, at least one study suggests that naturally high levels of sterols might give Canola oil the ability to soothe skin that is irritated by surfactants. But these studies showed little effect on normal skin. And other studies show no benefit at all. But even if Canola Oil provides no special benefit, it can still make your skin feel soft just because it’s an oil. The Beauty Brains bottom line: If you have irritated skin you may see some benefit from Canola oil. But for most people it probably doesn’t make enough of a difference to justify spending more money. A regular moisturizer will work just fine. (By the way term “rape” in rapeseed is derived the Latin “rapum,” which means turnip. That’s because turnips, rutabagas, cabbage, and Brussels sprouts are related to the rapeseed plant.)","Can canola oil condition skin?","cb990d639160af6ebe1d9519aef36d912757a81f","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2008/02/can-canola-oil-condition-skin/"
"Perry Romanowski","","Can Collyre Bleu Eye Drops make your eyes blue by Perry Romanowski Darkeyes dwells on drops… I read that Collyre Bleu Eye Drops are used on models and celebrities to make the whites of the eyes whiter and that it also makes blue eyes bluer and gives a little sparkle to the eyes. I don’t think it is available in the US, and I couldn’t find the ingredients list for this product. I’m interested in buying this product but is it safe? Are there any negative long-term effects from using this product? The Beauty Brains respond: As you might infer from the spelling of “bleu,” Collyre Bleu Eye Drops come from France. According to their website, French women have been using these drops for years “to enhance the intensity of their eye color and their beauty.” In the rest of the world “make-up artists have kept this little beauty secret to themselves.” Well, apparently they weren’t very good at keeping secrets, because anyone can buy it now on the Internet. The Wow effect From what we can tell, it looks like the French company that owns the product is GSP (Groupe Services Pharmactifs Inc.) but the US distributor is a company called Verseo. According to Verseo’s website: “Blue Eye Drops increase the intensity of blue eyes and the whiteness of the cornea of all eye colors for instant WOW! effect.” The site goes on to say that regardless of your eye color, Collyre Bleu Eye drops will… Make your eyes look clear and bright. Increase the appearance of alertness and awakeness. Enhance your eyes intensity for photos. Eliminate the appearance of redness due to any factors including tiredness, allergies and more. Eliminate yellow-ness in your sclera (white part of your eye) for bright white eyes. The Red, White, and Bleu The product makes two key claims: it makes eyes whiter and increases the intensity of eye color. Let’s look at whitening. First of all, we find it odd that the makers of the product claim that it affects the “whiteness of the cornea.” This wording implies that the cornea is the white part of your eye when in fact it’s not – it’s the covering of the iris and the lens. And the cornea is clear, it doesn’t have any color. (The iris is the colored part of the eye. The white part is called the sclera, just in case you’re keeping score. They did get it right in the final bullet we quoted above.) The fact that Verseo doesn’t seem to have a good grasp of eye anatomy doesn’t exactly inspire a lot of confidence in their ability to deliver a product that really works. Eye whitening products, like Visine work by reducing the appearance of blood vessels in the eye. Visine contains tetrahydrozaline hydrochloride, a drug that constricts the blood vessels in the eye to reduce redness. Collyre drops don’t appear to contain any such drug actives. Here are the ingredients: Aqua, Boric Acid, Chamomilla Recutita Extract, Anthemis Nobilis Extract, Malva Sylvestris Extract, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Borate, C142051 Based on reviewing Pubmed and various ophthalmologic sources, the only one of these ingredients that has any documented use in eye care is Boric acid. It’s used to irrigate the eye, to buffer pH buffer, and to preserve the product. While it could have some soothing effect, we could find no specific information that indicates it will whiten the sclera. Likewise, the botanical extracts used in the formula have no referenced functionality in eye care. The only other ingredient that could theoretically have a whitening effect is the last one, the blue dye (C142051). Blue/violet colors can cancel out yellow shades because they are opposite colors. A substrate can be whitened by counteracting yellow with a little blue. This is similar in principle to how fabric brighteners work. So, in theory, Collyre could be making the whites appear whiter by counteracting yellow. But that’s just our guess. Don’t it make your brown eyes bleu We can find no mention of any mechanism by which the intensity of the iris color can be increased via eye drops. So, we’re assuming that if the whitening effect described above really works, what’s happening is that these drops increase the appearance of the iris color by increasing the contrast between the white part of the eye. In other words, the iris color appears brighter and deeper against a nicely whitened background than it does compared to a dingy, yellow sclera. It seems that this kind of claim could easily be backed up with some research, but there’s no reference to any kind of studies on any of the websites we looked at. Long term safety? Finally, Darkeyes asked about the safety of this product for long-term use. We have no idea. On one hand, Boric acid is used in many other eye drop products on the market. On the other hand, according to Dr. Steven Pray of the School of Pharmacy at Southwestern Oklahoma State University, boric acid exposure in the eye should be limited because of potential toxicity. The Beauty Brains bottom line This may be a perfectly wonderful product, but unless Verseo can present some kind of data to substantiate that these drops are safe and effective, we’d stick with a proven eye-whitening drug like Visine. Has anyone in the Beauty Brains community tried these drops? Leave a comment and share your experience. And let us know if you’ve seen any technical references to how and why this product really works.","Can Collyre Bleu Eye Drops make your eyes blue","198ec0e102511798017f935c47f2dbc86b233e2c","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2008/02/can-collyre-bleu-eye-drops-make-your-eyes-blue/"

"The Beauty Brains","","Aloe vera actually works by The Beauty Brains Sarah Bellum Says: One of my personal heroes of the cosmetic industry is Zoe Draelos, MD a dermatologist who is frequently quoted on matters of cosmetic science. In a recent article in Dermatology Times , Dr. Draelos answered a question that’s bugged me for ages: Is there really a scientific reason that aloe vera is good for burns? So, here are three things you should know about aloe vera: Where does Aloe come from Aloe vera gel is harvested from plants by cutting open the leaves and collecting what oozes out. This thick, clear “ooze” is known as a mucilage. What is Aloe made of This mucilage is 99.5% water. The other 0.5% is a combination of mucopolysaccharides, choline and choline salicylate. What does Aloe do? Aloe works two ways: Mucopolysaccharides are film formers that create a thin, protective covering over the burn as the aloe dries; this film helps shield exposed nerve endings. Choline salicylate (which is chemically similar to the active ingredient in muscle rub creams) is an anti-inflammatory that soothes burned skin. Her explanation really helped me understand why this natural remedy really works. But here’s the REALLY important part: don’t buy products that use reconstituted powdered aloe vera because it doesn’t contain the same 0.5% of goodies that make the aloe work. Have you ever used aloe vera gel on a burn? Did it work for you?

"The Beauty Brains","","10 things you should know about scunci hair extensions by The Beauty Brains Judy’s jaw clipped question: I bought long layered Scunci brunette jaw clipped faux hair. Although in the store, under their lighting, it looked like a match, when I went to wear it, the color was about 2 shades lighter than my natural hair. Are there any products that I can use to darken it? Would regular hair dye work on synthetic hair? The Right Brain’s response: We certainly get interesting questions from the Beauty Brains community! We’ve blogged about the dangers of hair extensions before, but we’ve never stopped to think about what synthetic hair is made of. So, we did some research and put together this list of interesting fake hair facts. 1. Better living through chemistry One of the most common types of synthetic hair is made from fibers known as modacrylics. These consist of a long chain synthetic polymers composed of less than 85% but at least 35% by weight of acrylonitrile units. (-CH2CH[CN]-)x. (I’m sorry, but the Left Brain made me put in the chemical structure. I apologize in advance for the geekiness.) Modacrylics can also include mixtures of acrylonitrile and other materials, such as vinyl chloride, vinylidene chloride or vinyl bromide. (Yawn, enough organic chemistry already!) 2. Spinning wheel Modacrylic fibers are made by a spinning extrusion process and can be either dry spun or wet spun. FYI, of all the Beauty Brains , Sarah Bellum has been “wet spun” the most times. If you know what I mean. 3. National Modacrylic Day The first commercial production of modacrylic fibers in the US was in 1949, by the Union Carbide Corporation. Remind me to mark that date on my calendar. 4. Is it real or is it Modacrylic? Modacrylic fibers feels and looks like real human hair. The material is nontoxic and nonflammable. It can be shampooed, blow-dried and styled with curling irons. It is also durable, washable and anti-static. 5. Moth proof! Hair made with this fiber has outstanding resistance to chemicals and solvents, is not attacked by moths or mildew, and is non-allergenic. 6. Fake fur The same kind of fiber used in hair extensions is also used to make fake fur for bedspreads, cushion covers and other interior goods because of its realistic appearance and soft texture. Fake fur reminds me of “That 70′s Show.” 7. The modern wig era In the 1970s, an Encino, California company sold modacrylic wigs what were actually sutured to your scalp for a mere $2,350. Oddly enough, that company is no longer in business today. 8. Dueling fibers There are several types of modacylic fibers, two of the most popular used in synthetic hair are Kanekalon and Toyokalon. Kanekalon hair looks more realistic in regards to color and texture but it tends to tangle and mat very easily. Toyokalon hair, on the other hand, is a softer synthetic hair that does not tangle as much as Kanekalon, but the hair color and texture does not look as natural. 9. Faux hair shortage According to some sources , there’s an impending shortage of synthetic hair. But never fear, the Kaneka company has developed a new type of fake hair known as ULTIMATM that’s made from collagen. 10. Don’t dye Finally, to answer your question Judy, regular oxidative dyes that you use on your own hair will not work on synthetic hair extensions. According to Kanecaron, fake hair is dyed using industrial processes that require extreme temperature (about 200F) and/or solvent delivery (usually from acetone). In either case, these are not conditions that you can safely duplicate at home.

"The Beauty Brains","","The Top 10 Mildest Body Washes by The Beauty Brains QM29′s irritation inquiry: I’ve read about SLS and how it is a harsh cleanser that dry/sensitive skins should avoid. But there are plenty of variety in “cleanser components” in shower gels/shampoo/soaps. Which are the components to look for when you have dry skin and/or dry hair ? Which ones are to be avoided ? Are they the same for skin and hair ? The Right Brain’s mildness missive: There are many ingredients that are milder than SLS but rather than bore you with a litany of chemical names we’ll cut right to the chase: Based on several research studies (see references below from the Journal of the Society of Cosmetic Chemists), the mildest cleansing ingredient for hair and skin is: sodium cocoyl isethionate. Why so serious (about mildness?) Sodium Cocoyl Isthionate (or SCI for short) is thought to be milder than other surfactants for two reasons: It doesn’t strip as much natural oil from your skin and it doesn’t attach to protein as strongly as other cleansers so it rinses better and is therefore less irritating. So why doesn’t every cleansing product use this ingredient? Again, two reasons: it’s expensive and (by itself) it doesn’t produce the most aesthetically pleasing product. That’s why you’ll most commonly see it used as a secondary surfactant in products. If you want to try this mild cleansing ingredient yourself, here is our top ten list of body washes that use it in significant quantities (i.e., SCI is the first or second ingredient after water as long as the first ingredient is not a lauryl or laureth sulfate.) One important note: we’re only talking about the mildness of this ingredient. There is no way for us to know if any of these products will irritate you because of other ingredients, like the fragrance. But if you’re sensitive to sulfate-based products and you are looking for an alternative that is based on milder cleansing chemistry, you might want to give some of these a try.

"The Beauty Brains","","Is Visine good for skin spots? by The Beauty Brains Leah sees spots: My grandmother always says to put a drop of Visine on spots. I’ve never done it, but was curious as to whether there is any truth in this. And would it damage the skin? The Right Brain’s red-eyed reply: Visine reduces red eye because its active ingredient, tetrahydrozoline hydrochloride, constricts the superficial blood vessels in the eye. But skin spots, like acne blemishes, scars and age spots, are not caused by dilated blood vessels. Therefore, there doesn’t appear to be any benefit to applying Visine to your skin. In fact, there’s at least one good reason NOT to use Visine any place else except your eyes. And that reason is related to a nasty practical joke. Visine and potty humor Supposedly, you can prank someone by someone by putting a few drops of Visine in their drink to give them an amusing case of diarrhea. (This is assuming of course, that you’re the kind of person who finds diarrhea amusing.) But according to Snopes.com , this prank is actually an urban legend; Visine will NOT give you the runs. But it will cause vomiting, seizures, difficulty breathing, blurred vision and it can even induce coma. Now THAT’S entertainment! Visine ruined my love life What does this have to do with your skin? Imagine the following scenario: The night of your Big Date you discover a nasty pimple on your face. Taking your kindly old grandmother’s advice, you dab a few drops of Visine on the zit. Later that night in the throes of passion, as your main squeeze’s lips brush across your rosy cheek, he gets a tiny taste of tetrahydrozoline hydrochoride. Sometime after the vomiting and tremors subside, but before he slips into a coma, he drives you home. You do NOT get a good night kiss. The Beauty Brains bottom line Visine may or may not ruin your date, but it won’t do anything for your skin spots. Slather on some Clearasil or cover up with some Face Spray Foundation instead. Does anyone else have a favorite grandma’s home remedy they’d like to ask about?

"The Beauty Brains","","Is backcombing bad for your hair? by The Beauty Brains Katy’s combing question: A lot if my friends backcomb their hair. They say it adds more volume. My hair is fairly short and I tried this but I looked like a bird’s nest. What type of products would you recommend for people with short thin hair who are looking for a little extra volume boost for their hair? The Right Brain’s reply: Good question, Katy. The answer is a combination of hair biology and product chemistry. What is backcombing? As the name implies, backcombing means you literally comb your hair backwards. Instead of moving the comb from root to tip, you reverse the direction and comb your hair from tip to root. This kind of combing is also known as “teasing.” It’s an old stylist trick to give your hair more volume. The good news – it works Does it really work? You bet! Why? Because you’re combing your hair against the grain, so to speak. Look at your hair under a microscope, or, if you don’t have a microscope handy, you can look at the picture at the right. The hair is covered by small scales, known as cuticles, that make a hair shaft look a little like the bark on a palm tree. As the hair grows, the cuticles form in such a way that the leading edge is facing toward the end of your hair shaft. When you back comb, you’re scraping the edge of the cuticle in the opposition direction. This action causes lifts the cuticle up and makes it stand away from the hair shaft. The more cuticles you lift up, the more volume your hair will have because each little piece of cuticle will push away the hair shaft laying next to it. You can create tons of volume by combing this way. The bad news – it’s damaging The bad news is that back combing is very bad for your hair. When you lift up those little pieces of cuticle, they never return to their nice flat arrangement, no matter what you do to your hair. Instead, they become increasingly loose and eventually break off. Once you remove enough layers of cuticles, your hair shaft will be damaged and you’ll create a split end. If it helps you to visualize it, think of cuticles like the shingles on the roof of a house. When they lay nice and flat they form a protective barrier on the roof that keeps the rain out of your bedroom. But when the shingles become loose, they break off and the next thing you know, the roof leaks and you’ve got a water stained carpet. That’s how cuticles work on your hair. Except for the part about staining your carpet. Is there any safe way to boost volume? Are there any good products that will allow you to boost volume without requiring you to scrape off your cuticle layer by layer? Sure, you can use a styling product to give the hair fibers some stiffness. Mousses and root boost stylers can coat your hair, providing some interaction that makes the fibers lift up and stand apart to it temporarily creates volume. Of course, this kind of volume disappears once you wash the product out of your hair. But does ANYTHING really last in this crazy modern world we live in? Here are few products you might try: 5 Popular Volume Boosters Tresemme Volume Big Boost Root Lift Spray Catwalk Root Boost Paul Mitchell Root Boost Redken Full Frame Volumizing Mousse Rusk Full Volume Mousse What’s your favorite tip or trick for adding volume to your hair?

"The Beauty Brains","2016-09-25 16:53:00","Crystalift microdermabrasion kit review by The Beauty Brains From The Beauty Brains Forum Member: Anonymous Blonde When I received the Crystalift Skin Resurfacing Kit with a month’s supply of uses, my first thoughts upon opening the box were how compact the machine is. It makes for quick and easy storage. Additionally, the user manual was easy to read, and helped me feel confident and comfortable about using the system. Skin resurfacing technology According to Crystalift, “the Crystalift System is the first and only at-home skin resurfacing machine using the same crystal and vacuum technology, just like professional treatments. With Crystalift, bring home your own personal resurfacing machine whose dual-action process combines both crystal resurfacing and vacuum-lift therapy to help stimulate surface cell renewal, allowing smoother, fresher skin to emerge – in one simple to use system. It’s easy, convenient and takes less than 10 minutes to give you softer, smoother, younger-looking skin for a fraction of the cost.” Safe for skin There are multiple settings on the machine to adjust the intensity to one’s skin that makes the product seemingly suitable for all skin types. There is also a safety feature that stops the vacuum system if you are applying the wand incorrectly or have pulled it away for your face. I was initially hesitant to do my own microdermabrasion, but between the easy-to-read manual and this safety feature, I felt at ease. No nose The process itself feels like sharp tingles on the skin. It was a little discomforting at first, but after the initial feeling I hardly noticed. Unfortunately, I found the wand could not easily be used over the nose, the safety feature kept kicking it because it was difficult to keep the wand completely flush to the skin. Aside from that, the process was extremely quick, easy, and efficient. Amazingly smooth skin Immediately after the process my entire face felt impossibly smooth. This system is remarkably proficient. After the first treatment, my skin was slightly reddened for the next day and looked similar to mild sunburn. When the redness faded, my skin was glowing! For the rest of the week, I was able to go without foundation. This system is amazing! Costly crystals The only downside with the Crystalift system is the price. The retail price of the system is $249, but the website has is offered for $199 . That said, considering the cost of professional treatment, I think the system is well-priced. The initial system comes with the machine and a month’s supply of uses. However, the cost of continuing with the system is only $39.95 a month if you sign up for the monthly club. That’s about $10 a week, which, when considered, is well worth it! I gave up two lattes a week, and signed myself up. My pores are less noticeable, my skin is supple, the skin tone is stunning, and I am a very happy customer. I would recommend this system to anyone who can afford to purchase it.

"The Beauty Brains","","Hair extensions may be killing your hair by The Beauty Brains Today’s question comes from Heather whose experiment with professional hair extensions turned into a nightmare: Heather writes: I got hair extensions out almost two years ago. I paid four thousand dollars for the kind that are put on individually with clips, which need to be put in and taken out with a tool that only salons have; they have to be adjusted every month. After about nine months, as the stylist was adjusting the clips, I noticed that my hair was coming out along with the extensions! There just was no more hair below the clip of hair extension hair. My hair was just GONE. It all broke off at hundreds of different places where the clips were attached. It looked like a horror film! I cried for months. Now my hair is still growing from my roots, but it’s not getting longer. Is there anything I can do to help strengthen my hair and stop it from breaking? If I were a multi-millionaire, would there be some way? Do movie stars have some way they repair their hair we don’t know about? The Brains Respond: Heather, your story is really touching and we`re so sorry for what you`ve gone through. Based on your description, you have a condition known as Traction Alopecia a type of hair loss that is caused by pulling on hair. In some cases this can be caused by wearing your hair in a pony tail, in your case it`s caused by the weight of the extensions. Over a long period of time, this pulling stress can cause the follicle to atrophy and stop producing normal hairs. Depending on the intensity and duration of the stress the follicle may or may not recover. (You should consult a dermatologist to confirm this is really your problem.) For more details please read this summary on Traction Alopecia from emedicine , you may find it helpful. Hopefully you had the extensions removed in time and your follicles will recover and begin producing thick, strong hairs again. But if your follicles were permanently damaged, there`s not much you can do. Sadly, there is no secret millionaire`s product that can solve your problem; there is no known medical treatment for late-stage Traction Alopecia. One thing MIGHT help increase hair strength, though is treatment with pure coconut oil. As the Brains have said before, that`s one of the few natural oils that has been shown to penetrate the cortex and provide some strengthening effect to hair. It won`t make your hair grow any thicker, but it might help protect your thinner weaker strands. We wish you the best of luck! Write back and let us know how your hair turns out.","Hair extensions may be killing your hair","bd76232e5cee3002d8ae52a468266f22d1206c9a","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2006/12/hair-extensions-may-be-killing-your-hair/"
"The Beauty Brains","","John Frieda Weather Works Review by The Beauty Brains From the Beauty Brains Forum Member Judy: I generally like John Frieda Hair Products. I have successfully used his Frizz-Ease Straightening Cream, Radiant Red Color System and Luminous Color Glaze. These products give good value for money and…uh…I try to get them when they are on sale. The Weather Is Here, Wish You Were Beautiful Sooooo…I was very receptive to trying their new product in the Frizz-Ease line called Weather Works which is meant as a system of products that are meant protect your hair from changeable weather conditions. Their promotional material says that these products are designed to “create a barrier to seal in essential moisture and block out excess moisture, thereby blocking out style-ruining effects of ANY weather condition (Winter, Spring, and Summer).” Huh? Did I actually believe THIS? Of course not, I am a natural skeptic and a regular Beauty Brains reader!! However, I have naturally curly hair that misbehaves whenever there is ANY humidity so I thought I would suspend my disbelief and see if these products could deliver on their extravagant promises. I used the products the first time (Weather-Proofing Daily Shampoo, Daily Weather-Proofing Daily Conditioner, and Weather-Proofing Style Sealant Crème) as directed and my overall impression was…Big yawwwwwn!. My hair felt soft to the touch but kind of flyaway and certainly not immune to humid weather conditions. Let It Rain However, realizing this was hardly the scientific way to experiment I decided to use it for a week to see what would happen. I was in luck…California was scheduled to get rain throughout the week so this would help me in more accurately assessing the product claims. I can now revise my initial snap judgment and say that these products DO indeed seem to control the effect that humidity would normally have on my hair. Both the shampoo and the conditioner are nice and creamy and the sealant styling cream is light but effective. I have used other silicone products to tame my naturally curly (and colored) hair but this lighter product seemed to work even better. Long term effect I think it is possible that the effect of these products may be cumulative after a few days of use. Today I thought perhaps there was some build-up from the shampoo and so I used my regular shampoo followed by the Weather Works products and would have to say my hair wasn’t as weather-proofed as it had been when using all THREE products. My bottom line would be that these products DO deliver what they promise. Yippee for me! When it’s raining I no longer have to resemble Mel Brooks’ Bride of Frankenstein with out of control hair! The cost is reasonable at $5.99/for each component. The ingredients touted as producing the weather proofing results are: Glyceryl Oleate in the shampoo to smooth, soften and resist humidity; Aminopropyl Dimenthicone in the condition to resist humidity; and a complex of polymers and silicones to smooth hair and maintain style.

"The Beauty Brains","","Do conditioners cause your hair to fall out? by The Beauty Brains Lunatique asks… During a discussion on conditioners etc, a friend of mine told me that I shouldn’t use conditioner on daily basis because I would eventually lose my hair. That one bothered me for a while (in the summer I wash my hair every day, and if I don’t use conditioner they are totally untamable), so I decided to ask my hairdresser which I trust. To my surprise, she agreed, but told me not to use it daily near the roots, because the emollients in it would soften the hair follicle and it wouldn’t be able to hold the hair anymore, thus making my hair fall. So…am I really causing that much damage on my hair, or is it just another beauty myth? The Right Brain responds: We thought we’d heard all the hair care myths but this was a new one to us. We’re highly skeptical that this could be true given that conditioner ingredients coat the hair shaft and that they generally are too large to penetrate into the follicle. Plus, we’ve never seen any data to suggest that emollients “soften” the follicle as your hair dresser suggested. We tried to be as thorough as possible and did a literature search but we could not find definitive proof that conditioners don’t cause your hair to fall out. But, we did find a study showing that shampoos with conditioning agents do not impact “hair fall.” Let’s take a look… Hair fall study We found this journal article (“Absence of effects of dimethicone- and non-dimethicone-containing shampoos on daily hair loss rates”) which was published in 1991 the the journal of the Society of Cosmetic Chemists. The study, conducted by researchers for Proctor and Gamble, involved 400 women in Thailand. They had women collect lost hairs ( in drains, combs, brushes, pillows, etc) for 2 weeks to establish a baseline of what normal hair loss was for them. (Most people will lose between 30 and 180 hairs a day.) Then they divided the women into 3 groups and on a blind basis gave them one of three shampoos: A regular non-conditioning shampoo, a silicone containing shampoo, or a 2-in-1 type shampoo with silicone. Results and Discussion Results showed that regardless of how much conditioning the shampoo provided, it did not impact hair fall rates. We recognize that this test was done on shampoos, not conditioners as asked in the question. But, it is reasonable to assume that this data could be extrapolated to conditioners for two reason: One, the testing was done with shampoos containing dimethicone which is one of the most popular ingredients used in conditioners. Two, one of the cells tested a two-in-one shampoo which typically contains cationic guar, which is representative of the kind of positively charged (or cationic) ingredients often used in conditioners. Therefore, we’d expect these results to be similar for conditioners. (If anyone finds a more recent study that contradicts our assumption, please let us know.) The Beauty Brains bottom line Conditioner helps keep your hair looking and feeling healthy. We could find no data suggesting conditioners cause your hair to fall out. If this really was an issue, the entire hair care industry would be affected and you can be sure that the large cosmetic companies would be racing to create the first “non-hair fall” conditioner because that would give them a competitive advantage.","Do conditioners cause your hair to fall out?","c4ca2ae1825646fa1069d59508c9bd5225b2ba01","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2011/11/do-conditioners-cause-your-hair-to-fall-out/"
"The Beauty Brains","","More Trouble for Jan Marini by The Beauty Brains After having their eyelash product seized by federal marshals in the US, Jan Marini now has European agencies to worry about. According to this story , the company is now under investigation by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in the UK. Apparently, they are still selling some of the product in Europe despite their legal problems at home. Like the FDA, the MHRA is concerned that the company is selling an unregulated, untested drug for cosmetic purposes. This may be the final straw that scares Jan Marini out of the eyelash lengthening business forever. According to Jan Marini herself, “We believe it makes sense to suspend these products while we strategically review our options.” This means that they will focus on skin care products like their Bioglycolic Facial Cleanser and likely let these eyelash lengthening products go the way of the dinosaur. But don’t worry. If there really is some effect by these bimatoprost containing eyelash lengthening products some big company will do the proper testing and relaunch a similar product in a few years. If this doesn’t happen, you can bet your Beauty Brain the testing didn’t show a sufficient effect.","More Trouble for Jan Marini","42405a8254bf4596da50b613074ce40de6b0153b","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2008/01/more-trouble-for-jan-marini/"
"The Beauty Brains","","The 3 worst hair horrors by The Beauty Brains Jenni’s Jumpy About Weird Hairs: I have 3 different hair aberrations that I don’t understand: 1. Crazy Hairs, as I call them. Out of nowhere, I’ll suddenly notice a very long (I’ve had up to 7 or 8 inches!), very fine hair on my chin, lower cheek, or neck. How does this happen? Is this akin to cancer of a hair? Needless to say this is plucked out immediately. 2. Chin Whiskers. Why, oh, why do we ladies of a certain age get these? I pluck, and darn if it isn’t back in a few days!!!! 3. Hair loss. Why do I lose a LOT of head hair all at once? Several months ago I was in the hospital very ill with a Norwalk-type virus. Starting about 6 weeks ago I began to lose massive amounts of my already thin hair. Why did they all fall out at once? And, why didn’t all the hair on my legs fall out, too? The Left Brain Responds: To answer your question I need to give you a bit of hair biology background: Let’s go all the way back to fetal development, when your cells are growing and differentiating. Some cells form eyes, teeth or intestines; others form follicles, the little tubes in your skin that grow hair. Some of these follicles are programmed to produce long, thick hairs like you usually get on your scalp. Others are designed to produce short, fine hairs like on your face, arms and legs. Most of the time, these follicles mind their own business and keep producing the kinds of hairs they were made for. But every once in a while, a couple of follicles will go rogue and start acting crazy. Scalp hair can become very fine and thin, or worse yet, fall out and not grow back! Facial hair gets coarser and longer, creating those crazy hairs you mentioned. What’s the cause? Well, no one knows the exact mechanism or how to control it but it’s related to hormones. That`s why changes in hair growth tend to be triggered by periods of hormonal change like puberty, pregnancy, and menopause. (Diseases and prescription medications can cause similar changes.) Different follicles on different people react differently, so it’s hard to predict what will happen and when. And unfortunately, there`s not much you can do about it except be alert and pluck those crazy long hairs before someone else spots them!","The 3 worst hair horrors","f4fce618b5eb6057dd91b041f0a7007a0ea82219","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2006/12/the-3-worst-hair-horrors/"

But, we did find a study showing that shampoos with conditioning agents do not impact “hair fall.” Let’s take a look… Hair fall study We found this journal article (“Absence of effects of dimethicone- and non-dimethicone-containing shampoos on daily hair loss rates”) which was published in 1991 the the journal of the Society of Cosmetic Chemists. The study, conducted by researchers for Proctor and Gamble, involved 400 women in Thailand. They had women collect lost hairs ( in drains, combs, brushes, pillows, etc) for 2 weeks to establish a baseline of what normal hair loss was for them. (Most people will lose between 30 and 180 hairs a day.) Then they divided the women into 3 groups and on a blind basis gave them one of three shampoos: A regular non-conditioning shampoo, a silicone containing shampoo, or a 2-in-1 type shampoo with silicone. Results and Discussion Results showed that regardless of how much conditioning the shampoo provided, it did not impact hair fall rates. We recognize that this test was done on shampoos, not conditioners as asked in the question. But, it is reasonable to assume that this data could be extrapolated to conditioners for two reason: One, the testing was done with shampoos containing dimethicone which is one of the most popular ingredients used in conditioners. Two, one of the cells tested a two-in-one shampoo which typically contains cationic guar, which is representative of the kind of positively charged (or cationic) ingredients often used in conditioners. Therefore, we’d expect these results to be similar for conditioners. (If anyone finds a more recent study that contradicts our assumption, please let us know.) The Beauty Brains bottom line Conditioner helps keep your hair looking and feeling healthy. We could find no data suggesting conditioners cause your hair to fall out. If this really was an issue, the entire hair care industry would be affected and you can be sure that the large cosmetic companies would be racing to create the first “non-hair fall” conditioner because that would give them a competitive advantage.

"Randy Schueller","","Scientists discover why we wear high heels by Randy Schueller Telegraph.co.uk reports that scientists may have found the formula for having perfect legs: they need to be long in proportion to your torso, but not too long. Lusty looks for longer legs In this study, researchers at Wroclaw University in Poland had male and female subjects evaluate the relative attractiveness of different silhouettes of a man and woman. They found that a person of average height (5ft 4in tall) was rated most attractive when their inside leg measurement was 30.5in, which is about 5% longer than the average leg measurement for a person that size. In other words, you could be more attractive if you could lengthen your legs by a few inches. Feel like a heel This study could provide a scientific basis for why some people think high heels makes a woman more attractive, because it makes our legs appear longer, getting us closer to that magic 5% number. Interestingly, the study showed that very long legs are not as sexy. The subjects rated women with legs that were 10% longer than average as less attractive. The study leader, Dr Boguslaw Pawlowski, also said that long legs may be an indication of good health because people with short legs tend to have a greater risk of cardiovascular disease and type II diabetes. What do you think? Is this an excuse to run out and buy a new pair from Martinez Valero, Bruno Magli or Gabriella Rocha? Or are lusty legs not worth the hassle of high heels?

"The Beauty Brains","","Don’t fall for lies about toxic ingredients in chemicals by The Beauty Brains Vic’s Talking About Toxins: There appear to be alot of inactive and a fair amount of even potentially hazardous or toxic chemicals in makeup. Now a days people want their makeup to be more biochemical active. From Germany comes a line of cosmetics called Dr Bauman whose claim to fame is no toxins. The claim appears true. What do you think about this line of products? The Left Brain Blows Away Dr. Bauman: I wonder, how did you get the impression that there are a lot of inactive and toxic chemicals in make-up? The truth is, there aren’t. Putting extra ingredients in make-up is a waste of money so cosmetic manufacturers will not do that. Quite the contrary, they try to minimize the amount of chemicals in the formulas. And toxic chemicals? I don’t think so. Every ingredient used in cosmetics (unless you buy from a non-reputable place) has been thoroughly animal tested to ensure that they are not toxic or hazardous. Anyone telling you otherwise is just trying to fool you into thinking you should buy from them. See this recent post we did on how and why companies lie to you . And here’s an older one . So, I looked at their website and would you believe it, the products contain the same old ingredients as anyone else. Look at this one, it contains Propylene Glycol ! Now, I know there is nothing wrong with propylene glycol but there is also nothing wrong with the mineral oil and fragrances and preservatives that Dr. Baumann says are so bad. It’s like people saying that medical petroleum jelly is bad for you. It’s just not true! And then there is this product that contains Sodium Laureth Sulfate! It is a perfectly fine ingredient but it’s the same thing everyone else uses. I can’t find any pricing for the formulas but I’m guessing they are not as cheap as the Neutragena stuff or Maybeline that you could buy at your local store.

"The Beauty Brains","None","Do mineral crystal deodorants really work? by The Beauty Brains We thought you might be interested in this email exchange with one of our favorite fans, Wendy Wild , who does the weekend show on KTU radio from New York. Wendy wonders: Hey, I haven’t contacted you in a while, so just wanted to see how you were. I really enjoy reading your site each day! Thanks for the great entries. Here’s a product I recently bought that I’m absolutely baffled by. Naturally Fresh Crystal Deodorant Stick. It’s one of those no-aluminum deodorants, however… It’s just a damn rock, lol. The weirdest thing is that it works (WELL). I still don’t understand how because it smells like nothing and looks (and feels) like a piece of plastic. However, it’ll magically keep you smelling like NOTHING for at least 24 hours. Any insight here? Sarah Bellum replies: Hi again Wendy, nice to hear from you. We’ve been busy here at the Beauty Brains, getting ready to publish our first book . Exciting, huh? To answer your question, the Beauty Brains have seen these mineral deodorants before. They do look like a hunk of plastic, or glass. That’s because they’re made from a mineral known as potassium alum, also known as potassium aluminum sulfate. Yeah, that’s right these mineral deodorants do contain aluminum! I always thought they were aluminum free. But unlike the aluminum salts used in antiperspirants, alum doesn’t stop you from sweating, it only helps control the growth of bacteria that makes your sweat stinky. If you like the way these mineral crystals work for you, that’s great. But don’t fall for all the advertising claims made by some of the companies that sell this kind of product. For example, Crystal Body Deodorant claims that regular deodorants are made with highly toxic chemicals. (If that was true we’d all be dropping over dead!) Others claim that mineral deodorants are being better for you because they don’t block the release of toxins like other deodorants do. While it’s true that antiperspirants do plug the opening of the sweat gland to reduce sweat, there is no data that proves deodorants (or more accurately, antiperspirants, are harmful because they block the release of toxins. Since your body doesn’t use sweat glands to rid itself of toxins, this really isn’t an issue. (This discussion reminds me of our post on Kinoki Detox foot pads . Hoo boy, what a controvery ol’ Lefty stirred up with THAT one!) If you can want learn more, read our previous post on the difference between antiperspirants and deodorants .","Do mineral crystal deodorants really work?","bdfc553f68f667de0abfa06a7c2843f5567ba6ef","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2008/02/do-mineral-crystal-deodorants-really-work/"
"The Beauty Brains","None","Rhamnose: Anti-Aging Miracle or Marketing Ploy? by The Beauty Brains ElenaMilano asks… Vichy has created a much publicized rhamnose based anti aging line, called Liftactiv. They claim rhamnose is a very important patented discovery and that it stimulates the papillary dermis, causing it to produce new skin cells, collagen etc. Is it true or is it the usual marketing ruse? The Left Brain responds: Vichy, for those who may not be familiar with the brand, is the self-proclaimed ”number 1 skincare brand in European pharmacies.” Vichy is also owned by L’Oreal so they have access to deep pockets for R&D spending. Liftactiv day cream According to Vichy’s website, there are 13 Liftactiv products, 3 of which contain 5% Rhamnose. Here are ingredients for the day cream: BUTYROSPERMUM PARKII BUTTER / SHEA BUTTER • RHAMNOSE • PRUNUS ARMENIACA KERNEL OIL / APRICOT KERNEL OIL • PENTAERYTHRITYL TETRAETHYLHEXANOATE • DIMETHICONE • ISOHEXADECANE • PENTYLENE GLYCOL • STEARIC ACID • STEARYL ALCOHOL • CERA ALBA / BEESWAX • PALMITIC ACID • PEG-100 STEARATE • GLYCERYL STEARATE • PEG-20 STEARATE • BIS-PEG-18 METHYL ETHER DIMETHYL SILANE • NYLON-12 • CI 77891 / TITANIUM DIOXIDE • MICA • TRIETHANOLAMINE • DIMETHICONOL • PHENOXYETHANOL • ADENOSINE • MAGNESIUM ASCORBYL PHOSPHATE • ASCORBYL GLUCOSIDE • POLOXAMER 338 • DISODIUM EDTA • CAPRYLYL GLYCOL • XANTHAN GUM • PENTAERYTHRITYL TETRA-DI-T-BUTYL HYDROXYHYDROCINNAMATE • A C R Y L A M I D E / S O D I U M ACRYLOYLDIMETHYLTAURATE COPOLYMER • POLYSORBATE 80 • PARFUM / FRAGRANCE So what’s the big deal about this product? Aside from the standard “reduces the appearance of wrinkles” claims, here’s what Vichy’s says about Liftactiv : “Our breakthrough formula features Rhamnose, a naturally derived plant sugar extracted in its purest form. Rhamnose in a 5% concentration, has been clinically proven to improve skin rejuvenation at the source; improving collagen production, elastin production and cellular turnover.” These are pretty bold claims to make and would require significant research. Is there anything to back this up? What does Rhamnose do? According to a study from PubMed, in vitro lab tests on cell cultures (i.e., testing done in a “glass dish”) show that cell cultures treated with rhamnose and other similar compounds produced fewer aging byproducts (known as Advanced Glycation Endproducts or AGE). (1) These results suggest that rhamnose could be an effective anti-aging agent. Of course laboratory testing alone does not demonstrate that the benefit will be seen when used on real people, but surprisingly (at least to me) there is an in vivo study that backs up the laboratory testing. Clinical testing According to a paper presented by L’Oreal (2), the effectiveness of Rhamnose has been confirmed in by in vivo testing. A rhamnose containing lotion and a placebo lotion were applied twice a day for 8 weeks to the internal side of forearms of female volunteers between the ages of 50 and 7. Clinical and histological measurements were taken before and after treatment and the results showed “a significant increase of pro-collagen I expression at papillary dermis level and considerable epidermis thickening…” This looks to be a properly designed test but since I was unable to review the entire study protocol, I’m concerned that measured effects may be statistically “significant” but may not be large enough to be observable to the user. I’m still skeptical but it’s refreshing to have at least some basis for believing this technology works. The Beauty Brains bottom line We’re quick to call “Bull Sh*t” if there’s no evidence of a product providing a differentiated benefit. However in the case of Vichy’s Liftactiv, based on the limited information I’ve been able to find, it appears that rhamnose MAY provide a measureable anti-aging benefit that other products don’t. Whether or not you want to gamble $50 to find out whether or not you can tell a difference on your skin is up to you.

"The Beauty Brains","","3 reasons not to recycle lipsticks by The Beauty Brains Sandie’s sticky question: Has anyone tried making a new lipstick out of the end bits of old ones? There is always quite a lot left inside the case and I have about 25 almost empty lipsticks that I keep meaning to do something with. Just not sure how to go about it! Sarah Bellum Says: Sandie, that’s a very interesting question! I kicked it around with the other Beauty Brains and we think trying to fix those sticks is probably a waste of time. Here are three reasons why: 1. Color calamity Unless you have 25 tubes of the same color, you’re going to mix shades which might end up looking like baby poop. 2. Spoiled stick Lipstick formulas are a mixed up waxes, oils and pigments. Since not all lipsticks use the same ingredients, when you mix different products from different brands you might end up with a lipstick that’s too soft, too hard, doesn’t spread right, or just plain falls apart. 3. Messy molding If you’re like me you’ve got a couple of tubes of Clinique a couple of Lauder more than a few Revlon Colorstay and maybe, just maybe even a Nars But even IF all 25 lipstick stubs are the same brand and same color and IF you were able to mix and melt them you couldn’t make a new lipstick unless you had a special mold to shape your melted lip goop into a new stick form. For that untidy little job you need a two piece metal mold. (Hmmm, maybe someone should sell a special lipstick saver mold…) Of course, you could always pour it into an old lipgloss pot if you don’t mind applying it with a brush or your finger. The Beauty Brains bottom line Maybe I’m too lazy for DIY cosmetics, but it doesn’t really make sense to salvage old lipsticks. But if you do decide to give it a try, write back and let us know how it turns out. What do you think. Have you ever tried reworking lipstics? Or better yet, would you buy a special tool that let you redo your unused chunks of lipstick? Or, is it just not worth the hassle?

"The Beauty Brains","","Neutrogena Healthy Volume and Nourishing Eye Duos Review by The Beauty Brains From The Beauty Brains Forum Member: Purple Rules Neutrogena has introduced two new products that promise to make you look great and to improve the condition of your skin and lashes as well. I tried out the Healthy Volume Mascara and the Nourishing Eye Duos. Super-size it The mascara promises to give you 400% fuller lashes and to moisturize, protect and improve the condition of your lashes. 400% fuller lashes! Even professional athletes only promise 110 %. They say “the exclusive super sized Visible Volume Brush quickly coats and builds every single lash.” The brush certainly is super sized. It’s on the far left in the picture and is clearly larger than any of the other brushes. The mascara contains Olive, Meadowfoam Seed and Sweet Almond Oil, which “penetrate lashes on all dimensions to moisturize, protect and improve the condition of lashes” and rinses clean with water. Big brush The proof is in the pudding, of course; what really matters is how it applies and how it wears. The super sized brush made applying the mascara a challenge at first but gave me soft, natural looking eyelashes. The mascara didn’t clump or smudge and still looked great at the end of the day. I wasn’t able to remove it with water alone but it came off easily with a little help from a gentle cleanser. One coat resulted in a nice, natural look. Two coats gave me a little more oomph without getting clumpy or spidery. I don’t think my lashes were 400% fuller but I don’t own calipers so I can’t be sure. Eye conditioner The eye shadow duos are “the next evolution in eye shadow.” They contain a multi-vitamin complex that is “clinically proven to condition the delicate skin around the eye.” Each duo contains a coordinated base and accent color. The colors are sheer and easy to apply. I tried “Sweet Dusk” (a great color if you have green eyes) and “Iced Coffee.” They’re not highly pigmented and appear much lighter on. They stayed on well when I used a primer underneath but when I tried to build up the color for a more dramatic effect, I had problems with creasing. Healthy and wholesome Both products give you a healthy, natural look that’s entirely in keeping with Neutrogena’s wholesome image. I don’t know if my lashes and the skin around my eyes are healthier then before but both products apply easily and stay on well. They also wash off easily, which is important. There’s nothing more frustrating then watching your lashes go down the drain along with your makeup. You’re not going to achieve a dramatic evening look with these products, but that’s not what we’ve come to expect from Neutrogena. The mascara sells for $7.99 and the eye shadow duos sell for $8.49. What kind of make up looks best on your? Natural and wholesome, or dramatic and glamorous? Leave a comment and let us know.

"The Beauty Brains","","Jan Marini eyelash growth update by The Beauty Brains A previous post on Jan Marini Eyelash Growth product prompted many comments. Most of the comments were anecdotal stories about how people used the product and were convinced that it was the greatest thing they’d ever tried. While reports from users are interesting, they aren’t “proof” that the product works. It’s a basic Beauty Brain belief. “Anecdotal evidence does not prove anything” This Beauty Brain remained highly skeptical in a way that would make my heroine Rebecca Watson proud. But then the following comment was posted… Hello Everyone, I can`t stand the confusion anymore. Here is the scoop. The OLD Jan Marini eyelash product did indeed work. It had a DRUG in it for GLaucoma that had a known side effect of hair growth. A larger company already has a patent on it for this use. THAT IS THE REASON WHY IT WAS TAKEN OFF THE MARKET FOR MONTHS. Not surprisingly, the active secret ingredient was not disclosed on Jan Marini`s label. It did work however, so I hope that settles the confusion. People were using a DRUG!!!(for glaucoma) The NEW formulation does not have the drug in it. It was released last week. the new product probably will not work since there is nothing in it that can make eyelashes grow. The company is in fact writing letters to consumers telling them that the product is different. This is such a travesty. Thousands of people are waiting for the back ordered product, and now they will be getting nothing. The public always loses. I guess it is very difficult to come up with a safe, cosmetic product that indeed makes eyelashes grow. So, the OLD JM EYElash did work for most people, and now that is GONE. The new one has no drug in it. We are too late to do any studies. Sorry! I still remained skeptical but it prompted me to look into the claims and there just may be something to what this commenter said. It turns out that in 2003, a group of dermatologist published a paper in the Dermatology Online Journal suggesting that a drug used for glaucoma (latanoprost) actually stimulated eyelash growth. This could be the basis for the Jan Marini eyelash product. I was amazed that this could be true! It seems to me that this would’ve been HUGE news in the cosmetic business and the general public. But it went by without nearly a mention. Imagine the money this discovery could bring in! Then I dug a little deeper and found out why the discovery likely passed unnoticed. Subsequent studies were not able to repeat what the original scientists demonstrated. According to these scientists in an article published in 2005 in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology, topical application of latanoprost was NOT EFFECTIVE. Not having seen the original papers, I can’t say which research study is more believable. However, in terms of credibility, the American Academy of Dermatology is one of the premiere organizations in the area of dermatology so they win out there. Additionally, amazing claims like “Renews hair growth” require amazing proof. One paper in an online journal that can’t be reproduced by peers is hardly amazing proof. Beauty Brains bottom line: Jan Marini eyelash growth product could’ve been based on a drug used for glaucoma, and there is at least one study to back-up the use of that drug for eyelash growth. However, the work was not repeatable and we don’t know for certain that the Jan Marini product used the drug anyway! I continue to remain skeptical. No cosmetic will make any of your hair grow.

"The Beauty Brains","","Jan Marini Admits It – Age Intervention Eyelash Product Does Not Grow Hair by The Beauty Brains One of the most popular topics on the Beauty Brains is the Jan Marini Age Intervention Eyelash. People always want to know, “will this product make my eyelashes grow?” “Is it worth $160 for less than 1 ounce of product?” No evidence for lash growth We’ve looked high and low, but have not been able to find any scientific studies that would support that this product will make your eyelashes grow thicker and longer. But that hasn’t stopped people from leaving comments telling us how wrong we are. They insist that there is a special off-label glaucoma drug that Jan Marini uses in the product to make eyelashes grow. Or they insist that they’ve used it and it makes their eyelashes grow. While we’re skeptical, we continue to look for credible research that shows this product really works. Passionate comments Here is a recent comment that prompted some more research. Jim writes… Everyone has a right to their opinion, but blatant misinformation is not only inaccurate, but harmful.The new Age Intervention Eyelash product does work. Jan Marini Skin Research replaced the original prostaglandin analog with another customized prostaglandin analog that actually appears to be even more effective than the original. There was never a patent issue and Jan Marini Skin Research has patents pending on both the original and new formulations. The product has enormous positive media attention along with a huge celebrity following. Physicians throughout the US and abroad have validated the tremendous efficacy of the formula and continue to recommend it to their patients. There is no doubt regarding the amazing results. In addition, the company has excellent safety studies. This continued bashing and misinformation needs to stop. A loyal and informed fan. Patent pending? Well, there are certainly some testable claims here even though no references were given. First, we looked at the claim that they’ve got patents pending. Well, a search at the United States Patent Office reveals no such patents pending for Jan Marini. Second, “the product does work.” This we agree with. Jan Marini Age Intervention Eyelash does work, just like every other mascara you can buy. It DOES NOT work to make your eyelashes grow longer or thicker and we have excellent proof. What does Jan Marini say? Just look at what the company says on their own website about the Age Intervention product . We quote “Age Intervention Eyelash Conditioner is not intended to stop, prevent, cure, relieve, reverse or reduce eyelash loss or to promote the growth of eyelashes” The company admits that it will not grow your eyelashes! What more proof is needed? Word of mouth Third, that a product has a “huge celebrity following” and is endorsed by unnamed physicians throughout the US is not proof of anything. Everyone is susceptible to glitzy marketing and wishful thinking. And if you’ve spent $160 for a cosmetic to make your eyelashes grow, you probably don’t want to admit that you’ve been fooled. It’s ok, no one wants to, but it happens.","Jan Marini Admits It – Age Intervention Eyelash Product Does Not Grow Hair","8af3e8d255e0fc8e0e17427b76faa69c9e952280","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2007/05/jan-marini-admits-it-age-intervention-eyelash-product-does-not-grow-hair/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Jan Marini product seized by US Marshals by The Beauty Brains I had to take a break from working on the Beauty Brains book to comment on this story. We’ve written about and debated whether eyelash growth products like Jan Marini actually work. Some say yes, some say no. The Beauty Brains have always said we were skeptical unless they are using an unapproved drug. Well, that looks like it’s true. $2 million worth of product According to news reports, 12,682 tubes of the Jan Marini Age Intervention Eyelash product (purported to make your eyelashes grow longer) have been seized by US Marshals on directives from the FDA. In a press release , the FDA says that it “takes seriously its responsibility to protect Americans from unapproved drugs”. They say the product contains bimatoprost an active ingredient found in an FDA-approved drug. They say use of the Jan Marini product could result in optic nerve damage which could ultimately cause blindness. Other side effects could be swelling of the retina and inflammation in the eye. YIKES! The FDA recommends consumers who have bought the product should DISCONTINUE USING IT. According to the Fresno Bee , Jan Marini, the company’s president and CEO, the company stopped selling the product in September of last year. They should have known better not to sell it in the first place! The Beauty Brains bottom line We’ve said this before. If a cosmetic product claims to affect hair growth and they are not using an approved OTC drug, then it’s either an illegal drug or the people selling it are liars. In the case of the Jan Marini Age Intervention Eyelash product, it seems like they are the former.","Jan Marini product seized by US Marshals","0b4f1fc9714e7ad964e70e7fa156fac6553e8451","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2007/11/jan-marini-product-seized-by-us-marshals/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Do you need Nioxin for thinning hair? by The Beauty Brains Gail’s guard is up: My hairdresser assured me that Nioxin would make my thin, fine hair stop falling out so much and appear thicker. So far it just seems finer and thinner. (She insists that I need to use the Therapy conditioner as well as the shampoo.) What do you know about Nioxin? The Left Brain responds: Nioxin’s line of shampoos, conditioners, and treatments is an interesting example of a cosmetic product that has a reputation for having drug benefits. If you do a quick web search of Nioxin you’ll find numerous sites commenting on its ability to slow hair loss, increase hair growth, inhibit DHT (one of the causes of thinning hair) and make hair grow thicker. As we’ve blogged before , if a product really did claim to do any of these things it would have to be a drug and would require FDA approval. Hair today, gone tomorrow But if you go to the source and look at Nioxin’s website , there is no direct mention of any drug benefits. In fact, they are very careful to tell you that their product is NOT a drug and that it does not grow hair. What do they say? The Nioxin story can be summarized in three basic points: 1. DHT is linked to thinning hair. 2. Nioxin helps remove DHT. 3. The Nixon system reduces the appearance of thinning hair. Specifically their website says: 9 out of 10 people perceive a thickening effect when using the daily 3-part system.* *Independent Market Research conducted among consumers who perceived themselves as having fine, normal to thin-looking hair. Deciphering Nioxin’s clams What does this mean? They’re not claiming their product grows hair or even that it stop hair loss. They’re not even claiming that the product makes individual hair strands thicker. First, they’re just claming that DHT is linked to thinning hair which is true. Second, they say their shampoo removes DHT. This is true as far as any shampoo will remove any DHT that’s present on the scalp in sebum. Third, they are claiming that 90% of the people who used their shampoo, conditioner and treatment perceived a thickening effect. Since the 3 part system includes a leave in treatment that contains various proteins, and glycoproteins and other film formers, it’s likely that people are perceiving a thickening effect just from the ability of the product to provide a mild styling effect. In other words, if the product leaves a coating on the hair that stiffens it, it will look and feel like it has more body and will therefore be perceived as thicker. The Beauty Brains bottom line Nioxin, like Scalp med , is a good example of why you have to read claims very carefully so you understand what’s REALLY being said and so you aren’t fooled by what the advertiser is implying.

"The Beauty Brains","","The top 5 causes of droopy eyelids by The Beauty Brains Big Evie Is Feeling Droopy: Aside from surgical procedures, what’s the best way to lift eyelids that are just beginning to sag? I notice that my eyelids perk up after a nap, but I can’t sleep all of the time! The Right Brain Lifts Her Spirits: A saggy or droopy eyelid is also called ptosis or blepharoptosis . For most people this condition is just annoying but when the it’s severe, the lowered lid can actually interfere with your vision. There are 5 primary types of ptosis, each with it’s own cause: 1. Congenital ptosis This affects infants and occurs when the levator muscle (the muscle that lifts the eyelid) doesn’t develop properly. Surgery may be required to prevent permanent loss of vision later in the child’s life. 2. Muscle diseases This condition is like myasthenia gravis, progressive external ophthalmoplegia, or oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy, can cause ptosis too. These conditions are much more serious and ptosis os more of a side effect than the actual problem. Seek medical help if you think you have any muscular disorder. 3. Nerve problems These can cause ptosis because the eye muscles are controlled by nerves. Any condition that damages the nerves, like a stroke, brain tumor, brain aneurysm can result in ptosis. 4. Local eye problems Special conditions like eye infections, tumors inside the eye socket, or even a blow to the eye, can cause ptosis as well. 5. Aponeurotic ptosis Also called senile or age-related ptosis, aponeurotic ptosis is the most common type. The combination of gravity and aging results in a stretches the tendon-like tissue that helps the levator muscle hold the eyelid open. Hard contact lenses, history of eye infections, of trauma to the eye can increase chances of this type of ptosis. The Beauty Brains bottom line: Because gravity and old age are such powerful forces, The Beauty Brains think the most likely cause of your problem is the Age-Related type (We hate to call it the Senile Type!) But if your problem is severe, or if you’re having any other symptoms, you shouldn’t hesitate to see a doctor. Unfortunately, short of having eye surgery there’s really no effective treatment for droopy eyelids. Some film forming cosmetics may give you temporary respite by providing a slight tightening of the eyelid skin, but there’s no topical product that can truly reverse this condition.","The top 5 causes of droopy eyelids","46e8fe7e6bd9f720576f42c27cbde4c03e11c115","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2006/12/the-top-5-causes-of-droopy-eyelids/"

"The Beauty Brains","","3 ways to fight static flyaways by The Beauty Brains Denise is shocked by all the static electricity in her hair, especially in the winter time. So, she’s turned to the Beauty Brains to find out what causes it and how to stop it. The Right Brain gets excited about electricity in this response… The Causes of Static Electricity Static electricity, unlike the electric current that runs your blow dryer and your iPod, is caused by two unlike materials rubbing against each other. (Think about rubbing a balloon on your sweater or running a comb through your hair.) This process causes electrons to be transferred from the surface of one material to the other. The material that loses electrons ends up with an net positive charges and the material that gains electrons ends up a net negative charge. When this charge build up occurs on materials that don’t conduct electricity very well (like dry, damaged hair) the electrons just kind of sit there. (Hence the name “static electricity.) If there’s enough moisture in the hair the charge can dissipate, but in very dry weather it has not place to go. This charge buildup causes hairs to repel one another (like two ends of a magnet) and that’s when you get static flyaway. 3 Tips For Reducing Static Charge 1.) Reduce the friction that causes static charge. If you can, cut back on combing and brushing, be careful when putting on or taking off coats, sweaters, and hats. If you must comb or brush, using a wooden comb or brush can help. Ok, this isn’t the most practical advice in the world because you still HAVE to style your hair, but you get the idea – the more you rub stuff against your hair the worse the flyaway will be. 2.) Prevent charge buildup by increasing the conductivity of your hair. Increasing the conductivity of your hair means that the charge can be spread out and neutralized. Leave in products are particularly good for this because they’re less likely to build up on your hair over time and they can be easily reapplied during the day. You don’t have to spend $15 on something like Fredrick Fekkai Winter Hair Anti static Weightless Mist , there are plenty of other products that work as well. Read the back of the package and look for products that have the ingredients with the word quat or “amine” in their name. These ingredients conduct electricity better than silicones or oils and so are better static fighters. If you don’t like a leave in, you can spray Static Guard on your hair brush or you can even wipe your hair with a dryer sheet. Not our favorite choice but it gets the job done. 3) Improve the condition of your hair so there are less damaged sites. The more porous and damaged your hair is, the drier it will be. And the drier it is, the more likely that static charge will build up on it. Use a good rinse out conditioner every time you shampoo to keep your hair smooth and moisturized and you can lessen the likelihood of charge building up in the first place. If you don’t mind using silicones, Pantene is one of the best conditioners available. If you’re silicone-shy, try something like Nisim","3 ways to fight static flyaways","c7595c96db95a37fedff7df178af63188b2121f0","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2007/02/3-ways-to-fight-static-flyaways/"
"The Beauty Brains","","5 new ways to reduce animal testing by The Beauty Brains Nicky wants to know: What’s the latest scoop on animal testing? I’ve read your earlier posts on testing cosmetics on animals but I’m still worried that cosmetic companies abuse too many bunnies and such. The Right Brain replies: Nicky, your question could not have come at a better time. We just read a press release from the Scientific Advisory Committee of the European Center for the Validation of Alternative Methods (also known as ECVAM) who announced that there are 5 new methods of testing skin and eye irritation that previously had to be done on rabbits. That means that products like hand soaps, face creams, and make up (among many, many others) can now be safely formulated and tested with out harming a single hair on a hare. But it gets better: one test mimics human skin so well that it will COMPLETELY replace testing on rabbits. Two of the other tests can identify severe eye irritants which will eliminate the need for live rabbit eye test. And, another new test for skin allergies will cut animal testing in half, saving up to 240,000 mice. All these test methods came about as a result of joint work between the US and the European Union. Thanks guys!! The Beauty Brains are thrilled to see that effective, scientifically valid alternatives to animal testing are becoming increasingly popular in the cosmetic industry. And that means that in the near future Nicky won’t have to wonder if any furry little creatures gave their lives to test her favorite eyeshadow, lipgloss or blush.","5 new ways to reduce animal testing","e14c062fa192e57d8fc16d0d958645a8e92c5496","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2007/05/5-new-ways-to-reduce-animal-testing/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Can kinoki detox foot pads save your sole? by The Beauty Brains Erin Inquires: Can you tell me how Kinoki Detox Foot Pads work or is it a hoax? It is a product that you place on your feet to remove the toxins from your body. The Left Brain de-feets Kinoki: I’m going with HOAX on this one, Erin. The power of vinegar According to their website, Kinoki Detox Foot Pads claim to draw harmful toxins through the bottom of your feet by using distilled bamboo vinegar. All you do is place the pads on the soles of your feet. As you sleep, the vinegar sucks the evil toxins from all your organs, through your blood stream, until they pass through the bottom of your foot where they are absorbed by the pad. It works on all kinds of contaminants including heavy metals, metabolic waste, microscopic parasites, mucous and even cellulite. You can tell it really works because as the pad absorbs toxins it changes color from white to gray-black. What a load of crap! The idea that toxins can be sucked out of your body through the soles of your feet is completely absurd. Dr. Stephen Barrett, M.D., part of the Quackwatch network, did a great job of debunking detox foot patches . He points out that skin is not a permeable membrane, so substances will not easily flow out of the body through the skin. And even if materials could pass through the skin this way, that’s not how detoxification works. True detox involves the liver and kidneys working together to filter the blood. The skin just doesn’t work that way; all it can do is emit sweat, which contains water and salt (and a little sebum). The Beauty Brains bottom line This entire concept is so unscientific that it boggles the mind. Yet, even Amazon.com sells detox pads like this! Let the buyer beware!

There are thousands of comments from nearly 400 members on all kinds of beauty issues. As a special reward to the more prolific Forum members, we provide them with new beauty products to review. In today’s post, forum member “Judy” shares her thoughts on Neutrogena Triple Moisture Hair Conditioner . Triple Moisture: Is it a “must have” or a “maybe?” Judy says: The Neutrogena Triple Moisture Hair Care line is described by the company as the solution to the fact that “hair experimentation has evolved faster than the availability of effective hair treatments.” For a brief moment I thought dismissively that they couldn’t be talking about MY hair. Experimentation? I don’t dye my hair a different color every couple of weeks…and I don’t style my hair everyday with lots of goopy substances. However, then reality hit and I realized that I do have my hair colored every month and do use quite a few products even before I blow hot air on it. Sooo…maybe I actually should consider something like Neutrogena’s Triple Moisture Deep Recovery Hair Mask. After all, who am I to pass up recovery…especially DEEP recovery. This deep conditioning product is a heavy cream that is to be applied sparingly after shampooing and left on the hair for 3-5 minutes before rinsing out. It is meant to be used as a weekly treatment for dry or damaged hair. According to the packaging the Triple Moisture comes from: Olive which penetrates the center of the hair shaft; Meadow Seed which helps moisturize the middle and Sweet Almond which seals the surface hair. I don’t know if these claims are scientifically true but each of these natural ingredients are known as emollients that have moisturizing properties. I have naturally slightly coarse, naturally curly hair that is colored to cover the gray. I used this treatment twice within a week as directed and my results were that my hair felt softer to the touch but in both instances actually a bit over-conditioned and fly-away. And so it may be that my hair was not in such bad shape as to need a deep conditioning treatment as often as weekly. Neutrogena Triple Moisture product line also includes shampoo, conditioner, leave-in cream, and a shine serum. All are priced between $7-$12 so they are reasonably priced. The Mask that I sampled currently comes in a generous 6-oz size for $6.99 which seems as if it would last forever, especially if you didn’t use it on a weekly basis. For those with truly damaged and/or over-processed hair this conditioning mask might work well but for me the results wouldn’t make this a “must have” for my hair care regime.

"The Beauty Brains","","Aveeno Essential Moisture Lip Conditioner by The Beauty Brains If you enjoy the Beauty Brains blog, you’ll also enjoy sharing your thoughts with others in the Beauty Brains Forum . There are thousands of comments from over 400 members on all kinds of beauty issues. As a special reward to the more prolific Forum members, we provide them with new beauty products to review. In today’s post, forum member “Karen” shares her thoughts on Aveeno Essential Moisture Lip Conditioner . Addicted to lip balm I love using lip balm and you may, too. Evidently, 64% of women use lip conditioning products. I have tubes of it everywhere and can’t stand how my lips feel when it’s not on. I might even go so far as to say I’m addicted to it, but experts say there’s no need to worry about that . There simply isn’t an ingredient in any of them that could cause a true chemical dependency. Okay then: I might not have a chemical dependency for it but I must have a psychological one because I sure feel relief once I slather it on and my lips feel a whole lot better, too. My products of choice First, I reach for Blistex to repair, soothe, and moisturize. It’s an absolute must for me to protect my lips from the elements once the cold weather hits. Second, a fellow Beauty Brainiac in the Forum recently turned me on to Caudalie Lip Conditioner, a wonderful but pricey creation that takes lip balm to a whole new level with its antioxidant ingredients. It’s now my go-to product that I apply before bed to repair free-radical damage. I’ve also found that it makes an excellent base under lipstick, a function my beloved but slippery Blistex can’t do. Additionally, it contains a sunscreen so I wear it on my light makeup, lipstick-free days. Essentially Aveeno When I had the opportunity to try another lip balm, Aveeno’s Essential Moisture Lip Conditioner with SPF 15, it seemed like the perfect assignment to send my way. Aveeno claims their lip balm is unique in the following ways: It’s enriched with natural oatmeal, an ingredient known to soothe skin It contains a blend of natural conditioners including jojoba oil and shea butter It leaves lips feeling moisturized long after applying It shields lips from harmful UVA an UVB rays It’s hypoallergenic Aveeno explains it was also developed to address frustration over the constant need to reapply lip balm, a common complaint from women using other products on the market. Soft and smooth, not heavy and waxy I used it for a week, giving up both Blistex and Caudalie Lip Conditioner. How did Aveeno’s lip balm compare to what I personally liked and used? I didn’t think it was as good at repairing chapped lips nor keeping them as moist as Blistex but it did a reasonable job of making them feel soft and smooth when it was on. I liked the fact that it didn’t feel overly waxy or heavy but I did feel the need to apply it at least as frequently as my other two products of choice. It’s also effective as a lipstick base but doesn’t contain the antioxidant ingredients that Caudalie lip conditioner does to soften fine lines and keep lips plump at the same time. “Fragrance” was not listed as an ingredient but it had a mild pleasant vanilla scent due to the addition of Vanillin. Petrolatum is best I did a little research on lip balms. I learned that petrolatum-based lip balms are always a smart choice for chapped lips. One dermatologist called this key ingredient “the gold standard” for lip balms and claimed it was the very best thing that you could possibly put on your lips. Does Aveeno’s lip balm contain it? The answer is yes. A good value Its price is very good: $3.49 or less per tube and it’s available at most drug stores. It comes in both stick and pot form. Overall, it’s a good value for the money if you’re looking for a lip balm to maintain soft healthier looking lips. If you’re looking for a product to prevent or repair chapped, cracked lips or a lip conditioner that offers anti-aging benefits, you might want to have something else on hand. What you use will depend on your likes and needs. There you have it, Brainiacs! Now I’m off for my must-have lip conditioner “fix!” What do YOU think about Aveeno Essential Moisture Lip Conditioner ?

"The Beauty Brains","","Put antibacterial lotions to the stress test by The Beauty Brains According to a study published in the November issue of the Journal Clinical Investigation, researchers at the University of California, San Francisco have discovered the link between stress and skin infections. Their theory goes something like this: How stress effects skin Psychological stress causes your body to increase production of chemicals called glucocorticoids. The glucocorticoids then decrease synthesis of fatty materials in the skin’s upper layer. Without these fatty materials, antimicrobial peptides aren’t properly secreted to the skins surface. And without the bacteria-fighting power of these peptides, microbes are able to grow unchecked, thus creating an infection. Get it? More stress = more chance of infection. This prompts another question in my mind: are antibacterial lotions and cleansers more effective when your skin’s own natural defense system is compromised by stress? Hmmm. Sounds like another study is needed. Wouldn’t you love to know exactly when your skin needs extra protection? Someone should make a lotion that changes color or something to signal you that you need an extra shot of antibacterial protection.

"The Beauty Brains","","Is retin-a burning my face? by The Beauty Brains Seven-Teen Says: I’m quite desperate for any advice on my current skin situation. I have fair skin, and it turns out to be quite sensitive as well. I had a few break outs, being 17 and all, so I got Retin-a from my doctor. I used it last week for 2 nights, and became quite red. I stopped using this but stupidly decided to put on antibiotic to ease the redness. what was I thinking? I suppose I wasn’t. Currently my skin looks burned– extremely red, blotchy, bumpy disgusting and scaley. I’m devastated, I might sound incredibly melodramatic but it’s truly quite bad.I will be seeing my dermatologist next Tuesday but that`s more than a week away and I’m writing to ask you for some advice on what might help heal this. I stopped moisturizing in fear of making it worse. I heard that Lancome Nutrix helps with “any type of burns” but the only way I can get that is by ordering it on Amazon. Anything I can do? My texture is terrible right now, how long will it last? The Left Brain ‘s Reply: I need to preface this by saying we are not doctors. This question is best answered by the doctor who prescribed the Retin-a. But it is not uncommon for people to experience a worsening of their condition when using Retin-a before things get better. Essentially, your body needs to get used to the stuff. It usually takes 2 weeks before you start to see positive results. And it could take as long as 6 weeks before you get consistent results. It’s not likely that the antibiotics caused your problem so don’t beat yourself up about it. It is most likely the reaction of your body to the Retin-a. Then antibiotics won’t help however. There’s not much you can do to heal it as it’s an allergic reaction. It’s probably ok to use a hypoallergenic concealer but best would be not to use anything on your face. The condition should clear up in a day or two. Hope that helps.

"The Beauty Brains","2016-10-02 19:57:00","The scary secret of stronger nails by The Beauty Brains This is a message for Lynnette. I understand you skepticism about an industry that has earned your mistrust. I would like to offer you some FREE FlexiNail to show what it can do. If you have great nails, then give it to the friend that has the worst nails. Then just do me a favor and post the results of what happened when you used it. Contact me through the FlexiNail website: http://www.FlexiNail.com Below is a response I just posted on this site about another topic and will post it here as well. — Before you jump all over me – I WORK for FlexiNail. I do have an awful lot of knowledge about nails though – so maybe my brief comments here may make sense. Someone above very thoroughly described what a nail is and what it is made up of. Correct, it is dead cells packed together. As they pack together they “push” the nail out (it grows). When the body fights a disease or infection, sometimes this “growth” is disrupted and you will see a horizontal line across the nails. You can’t change that “ridge” until it gets pushed out to the end of the nail. I mention this because it is very difficult to change the make-up of the nail that is already there. It has a natural protective coating that as humans we tend to screw up with things like frequent exposure to water (dish washing, soaks in baths and even frequent hand washing with water or alcohol based gels etc); trying to make them look good (acrylics, nail polish, nail polish remover etc); and even exposure to weather (dry cold winters or dry hot summers). All of these things (and more) attack the nail’s protective coating and cause nail problems. The lipids are stripped from the nail and the nail “dries” out and becomes brittle or peels. Taking an oral supplement will NOT help and you are wasting your money if you buy some for your nails. Even most nail “oils” are simply an oil (which yes should hydrate and supply lipids to the nail) with “added” vitamin E etc. The vitamin E in these oils is mostly to stop the oil from going rancid, because unless the oil is able to penetrate through the nail’s protective barrier – the oil and the vitamin E etc just sit on the top of the nail and do very little other than to hydrate the cuticle (which is a good thing). If you want to see a real difference to your nails, try a penetrating nail conditioner (yes, like FlexiNail) that is designed to penetrate into the nail and take all the good stuff down with it. A good conditioner like this will help repel evil water and even when the nail is exposed to the elements or our treatment of them – they are “re-hydrated”. I know you are skeptical, but read some of the testimonials on the site and even watch the video of ME bending over and snapping my nail 90 degrees. Watch the video, I think you will like it. And for the last “sales” pitch, if it doesn’t work for you – there is a 100 DAY (one hundred day) money-back guarantee and FREE s/h on top of everything else.

"The Beauty Brains","2014-05-25 21:12:00","Don’t ruin your nails by using the wrong sunscreen by The Beauty Brains Kelly and Dixiemedic have the same problem: Kelly has acrylic nails and every time she applies Coppertone Waterbabies sunscreen to her daughters, it ruins her manicure. Dixie says sunscreen makes her nails all sticky but she`s not sure if it`s the topcoat or the nail itself that`s messed up. They both want a sunscreen that won`t mess with their nails. The Right Brain tries to help: Are Sunscreens Bad for Nail Polish? We`re surprised more people haven`t asked about this; in fact, we`re surprised this isn`t all over the internet! Why? Because it`s TRUE that sunscreens can soften or dissolve acrylic nails or nail polish. As we`ve said before, sunscreen ingredients can be tough to dissolve (by the way, if you haven`t read our post on 3 Ways to Tell if Your Sunscreen is Bad, this might be a good time to do so). Anyway, it just so happens that some of the ingredients used to dissolve the sunscreen agents also dissolve the kinds of acrylic chemicals used in nail polishes and fake nails. In fact, some of these dissolving agents (or emulsifiers, as we chemists like to refer to them) are used in acetone free nail polish removers! For example, if you look at Cutex`s Acetone Free polish remover, you`ll see that it contains dimethyl adipate which is very similar to “dibutyl adipate,” a common emulslifier used in sunscreens. So it’s not surprising that you’re seeing a problem with your sunscreen making your nail polish sticky! And, this problem is only likely to get worse because as new high SPF, broad spectrum sunscreens become increasingly popular, cosmetic formulators will have to add more dissolving agents to the product to keep the active ingredients dispersed. Unfortunately, we can’t just tell you which sunscreens will cause the problem and which won’t. We’d have to test each sunscreen with each type of nail polish before we’d know for sure. That’s not very practical for us do to, but we can give you a tip for testing your favorite products: How To Tell if Your Sunscreen Will Ruin Your Manicure Smear a little of your favorite nail polish on a piece of glass (you can use an empty nail polish bottle or even a old compact mirror. Then, take that with you when you`re shopping for a sunscreen. Squeeze a little of the sunscreen product onto your polish smear and see if it softens the film. That should be a pretty good predictor if it will be ok when you actually apply it with your manicured fingers. Kelly, try this experiment with your Waterbabies product and see if it helps! Let us know how it works out. And as always, thanks for being part of the Beauty Brains community!","Don’t ruin your nails by using the wrong sunscreen","1672be5162d9aca7bc4d6b206b089ed6f9deca5e","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2007/05/dont-ruin-your-nails-by-using-the-wrong-sunscreen/"
"The Beauty Brains","2018-01-09 10:53:00","Phytorelaxer: the lie of no lye relaxers by The Beauty Brains Neecholle needs knowledge: I have natural African-American textured hair, which I would like to grow longer by keeping my hair natural, healthy and moisturized. How safe, effective, and natural is the PhytoSpecific PhytoRelaxer ? The Right Brain responds: Before we answer your question about Phytorelaxer, we’ll explain about hair and how it’s relaxed for our readers who may not understand the process. Chemical bonds in hair The shape of hair is partly controlled by chemical bridges, called disulfide bonds, that connect protein fibrils together. Because these bonds are so strong, a powerful chemical reaction is required to break them apart before the hair can be straightened. This reaction requires a very high pH. For those of you who fell asleep during chemistry class, pH is a measure of how acidic or basic a substance it. The pH scale runs from 1 to 14. Chemicals with a very low pH value (around 1 to 3) are very acidic and can be damaging to hair and skin. Chemicals with very high pH (10 to 14) are very basic and can also be damaging. Relaxers have high pH Relaxers must have a very high pH (11 or above) in order to work. Unfortunately, this pH can also weaken your hair and damage your scalp. Historically, relaxers used a chemical called sodium hydroxide (also known as “lye”) to create such a high pH. Over time, chemists found similar chemicals like calcium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide, ammonium thioglycolate, and guanidine carbonate which basically do the same thing. Relaxers based on these chemicals are called “no lye” because they don’t contain sodium hydroxide. But they still expose your hair and scalp to very high, potentially damaging pH. How Phytorelaxer works Phytospecific’s Phytorelaxer is a no-lye type. It’s based on guanidine carbonate and its pH is between 11 and 12. Here’s what Phytospecifc’s website says about the product: “Phytorelaxer is effective yet different because it permanently relaxes hair without harsh chemicals or irritation usually associated with chemical relaxers. The active ingredients in the straightening cream are a complex of egg and soy extracts. These ingredients are from 100% botanical sources and are hypoallergenic.” This is a very misleading statement for two reasons. First, the pH of this product is very high, almost as high as lye relaxers, so it is using harsh chemicals. Second, the straightening cream may contain natural ingredients but egg and soy are not what make this product work. This cream is only one of the products in the relaxer kit. You also have to use the high pH guanidine carbonate Inductor product, or the hair won’t be permanently straightened. So, to answer your question: is this a safe product? It’s as safe as other no-lye relaxers. Is it effective? Yes, it’s active ingredient really works. Is it natural? No, but Phytospecific leads you to think that based on what they say about the product. In our opinion, that’s misleading to consumers. They have a very good product, they shouldn’t have to distort the truth to get people to buy it. The Beauty Brains bottom line Phytorelaxer is a good, but somewhat expensive, alternative if you’re looking for a milder relaxer. But don’t fall for their hype about natural egg and soy extracts permanently straightening your hair because that is just NOT TRUE. If you want to try it for yourself, you can buy Phytorelaxer here . And if any of our community would like to share their thoughts on no-lye relaxers, we’d love to hear your comments.","Phytorelaxer: the lie of no lye relaxers","a22bde32bc5e2ff0aafaf19f6e1d14ea57556cd1","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2008/01/phytorelaxer-the-lie-of-no-lye-relaxers/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Is salt good for your face? by The Beauty Brains Stephanie says: My friend raves about Estee Lauder Idealist Micro-D Thermal Face Polisher so I looked up the ingredients. The first one listed is calcium chloride, which, apparently, is corrosive and is used to make bleu cheese. How can this be safe to use on your skin? My friend also wants to know if adding an eye dropper-full to a jar of her regular scrub would yield the same exfoliating results? The Right Brain ’s cheesy reply: We’re not sure what calcium chloride does for cheese, (our guess is that it’s a protein cross-linking agent) but in this formula it functions as a gritty abrasive. And yes it can be corrosive if left in contact with metal surfaces, but in the context of a rinse-off facial scrub you don’t need to worry about that. Salty scrub Can you add calcium chloride to your regular scrub and save a ton of money? No, and here’s why. This Idealist product is basically a type of salt scrub. As the name implies, salt scrubs use salt crystals as exfoliating agents (sugar scrubs do the same with sugar.) Since salt dissolves in water, these scrubs have to be made with oil or some other anhydrous base. (Anhydrous just means “without water.”) In the case of this Idealist product, the formula is based cyclomethicone, a type of silicone, instead of water. But if you added calcium chloride to a regular water-based scrub, like St. Ives Apricot scrub , it would just dissolve and would have no benefit. The Beauty Brains bottom line This may be a perfectly fine product, but it’s really just a glorified salt scrub. The most important question in our mind is, is Idealist Thermal Face Polisher worth it’s $63 price tag? Does anyone use expensive department stores brands, like Estee Lauder, instead of drug store brands?

"The Beauty Brains","2017-10-20 12:03:00","PURPOSE redness reducing moisturizer by The Beauty Brains If you enjoy the Beauty Brains blog, you’ll also enjoy sharing your thoughts with others in the Beauty Brains Forum . There are thousands of comments from over 400 members on all kinds of beauty issues. As a special reward to the more prolific Forum members, we provide them with new beauty products to review. In today’s post, forum member “ Taiwanese Girl ” shares her thoughts on PURPOSE Redness Reducing Moisturizer . Taiwanese Girl tells all: I used to have an extremely sensitive face that was always red. The redness was from a combination of pretty stupid things, such as: Using products that irritated my skin (thanks mom for telling me to use a salt scrub everyday to get my face really REALLY clean!) Spending tons of time in the sun without proper SPF, and The lovely and infamous Santa Ana winds that we experience here in LA. Mother doesn’t always know best Even though my skin has calmed down dramatically since the days of following my mom’s clueless skincare advice, my face is still a tad red and angry looking. When the opportunity to sample PURPOSE Redness Reducing Moisturizer with SPF 30, I took it right away. After all, according to its website, this product claims to have “CLINICALLY shown to reduce redness in just one week while it protects your face with broad-spectrum SPF 30 sunscreen. Its unique moisturizing complex begins to soothe dry skin on contact and works to improve overall skin tone and texture.” After using it in the morning for 5 days, I don’t know if my face is really less red. The area right beside my nose is still red, but I think that’s due to my year-round “seasonal” allergies. Also, my face has been behaving rather well for the past 2 months, meaning no angry pimples exploding out of nowhere, no random rashes (except when I eat seafood), or anything evil. My diet has been normal, I haven’t seen the sun since I started working, and I’ve also been getting plenty of sleep each night. I did ask my sister over the weekend if she thought my face looked less red, and she said it did… BUT, I’ve been having stomachaches the entire weekend, making me look a bit ghastly. So, does this product really work as a redness reducer? I really have no idea! None of the active ingredients are redness reducing agents, and their website doesn’t contain a working link to any research data showing that it contains an agent proven to reduce redness. A good value for UV Nevertheless, it’s a good basic morning moisturizer that contains tons of protection against both UVA and UVB. Their active ingredients are: Ensulizole, Octinoxate, Octocrylene, and Zinc Oxide, all of which offer great protection against the evil sun. It’s not oily at all, and it absorbs pretty quickly into my skin. I’ve found it to be a great base for both liquid foundations and powdered foundations. A lot of moisturizers tend to be too rich to use under liquid foundations, while others are too dry to use under powdered foundations, but this one was great for both. It’s also quite inexpensive and can be found at almost every drugstore. I definitely recommend this to people who spend a lot of time outside, but I can’t say for sure that it reduces redness.

"The Beauty Brains","","Does the beurer softlaser really help wrinkles? by The Beauty Brains Hoyun at Popgadget.net asks: What do you think of home laser treatment devices? Do they work? The Right Brain responds: Thanks for the question, Hoyun. We’re big fans of your blog and we saw your recent post on the Vitalmed Softlaser Wand for do-it-yourself laser skin treatments. Here’s what we think: What do lasers do for skin? As we previously posted , lasers are effective tools for the treatment of wrinkles and for skin resurfacing and specific laser devices have been approved by the FDA for use by dermatologists. Derms use these “professional strength” lasers to abrade the upper layers of skin, revealing “fresh” skin below. This is a serious treatment: some patients report mild pain and slight reddening (which can last for months.) For more information, you can read these laser facts from the FDA’s website. What is the Vitalmed Softlaser Wand? The Vitalmed Softlaser Wand (also known as the Beurer Softlaser) is a hand-held 5 milliwatt Aluminium – Gallium laser that produces a light beam with a wavelength 635 to 670 nanometers. According to a website that sells this thing, here’s the laundry list of things it does: Help reverse the effects of aging Reduce wrinkles & fine lines Stimulate collagen & tone skin Clears acne & erase blemishes, bruises Diminishes scars, stretch marks, cuts & burns Treats herpes / cold sores Helps treat tennis elbow, tendonitis, arthritis, sinusitis / rhinitis Heals eczema, dermatitis, rosacea, burns, spider veins & more… We make no medical claims in the U.S. – yet. It’s interesting that they say they don’t make medical claims in the US, yet here it is for sale. Does it really work? We can’t find any evidence that laser devices sold for home use are effective. In the US, the FDA does not legally sanction these devices. In Europe, according to the websites, Softlaser is a certified Medical Device that complies with the EU Directive 93/42/EEC. We’re not experts in interpreting EU legal directives, but we scanned the 46 page document and couldn’t find any indication that product performance is a criteria for certification. It appears to be more of a safety registration document. It seems to us that any device strong enough to produce the side effects mentioned above (when used by a dermatologist!) is probably not safe for home use. And if the home version is weaker and doesn’t have potential side effects it seems like it would be less likely to work. The Beauty Brains bottom line Since it’s not approved by the FDA and since we couldn’t find any clear evidence that this device actually works, we’re really skeptical. If any of our community in Europe, where this device is supposedly approved, have any additional information please let us know and we’ll update this post. In the meantime, you see a picture and find out more about a similar product, the Nuphase Soft Touch Laser here.","Does the beurer softlaser really help wrinkles?","6d473a091b16c8cf085b4b93088d8ec57fd581f3","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2008/01/does-the-beurer-softlaser-really-help-wrinkles/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Does oc8 oil control genius really work? by The Beauty Brains Christi’s Curious: Hi Beauty Brains ! I was wondering if you could tell me about the product OC8 Oil Control Genius. It says it has “ACRYSORB micro-particles” (which sounds like a marketing gimick to me), and it absorbs only the excess oil on your skin. I’m just wondering if it really does absorb the excess oil like it says it does. And if it is absorbing oil, like it says it is, and it’s all sitting on your skin, would this cause acne? The Right Brain Responds: Christi, The Beauty Brains applaud your skepticism! Acrysorb sounds like Marketing hype to us too! Let’s take a closer look: The product contains the following ingredients: Purified water, Acrysorb (brand of acrylates copolymer), propylene glycol, PEG-400, carbomer 940, sodium hydroxide, methylparaben, and disodium EDTA. The last two are easy: methyparaben and disodium EDTA are simply preservatives. The PEG-400 and Carbomer 940 are thickeners; the sodium hydroxide is a neutralizing agent for the carbomer (that’s what makes it get thick). The propylene glycol provide some humectant properterties and finally the Acrysorb (which is just their trade name for a type of acrylate polymer, is in the formula to absorb oil as they suggest. Is this kind of absorption possible? Well, there are certain types of acrylate copolymers that can absorb oil. So theoretically, this kind of product could “trap” some of the surface oil on the skin and make your skin feel less greasy. That should not contribute to acne breakouts, however, because oily skin is not the only cause of acne. You also need bacteria and clogged pores. But while it could work in theory, we doubt that it could absorb enough oil to really make a difference on your skin. To be fair, we haven’t actually tested it so we can’t say for sure. Have any of our loyal Beauty Brainiacs used OC8? If so, what do YOU think?","Does oc8 oil control genius really work?","8d22a6de27fc2be7d877162b3b639b2d34c5878f","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2007/01/does-oc8-oil-control-genius-really-work/"
"The Beauty Brains","","What should a 20-something do about aging? by The Beauty Brains Jessica’s asking about aging: It seems to me that the best way to keep my skin looking great and wrinkle-free would be to prevent as much aging as possible, as opposed to trying to reverse the process when I’m older. Other than sunscreen, what kinds of products should I be using at this point (I’m 25) to keep my skin looking young? The Left Brain’s rejuvenating reply: This is a great beauty question and one that we see asked more and more. The proliferation of anti-aging products has gotten so extensive, you’d think cosmetic marketers want us all to revert to 3-year olds. And with some of the claims made, they certainly treat us like that is the age of our intelligence. The Anti-Aging Secrets for your Skin You want to know what’s been proven to work? Here it is… Sun Protection First, protect your skin from the sun. This is the number one environmental cause of skin aging . Do this by minimizing your sun exposure and using sunscreen. Eat Well Next, eat a balanced diet. While everyone is different, this meta-review study on skin health and diet concluded that people who had higher intake of Vitamin C and linoleic acid and lower intakes of fats and carbohydrates had younger looking skin. You get linoleic acid by eating vegetables, fruits, nuts, grains and seeds. Exercise Finally, exercise. Nothing keeps you looking and feeling young like regular exercise. Thousands of studies have shown that physical exercise is a highly effective way to treat all all signs of aging. Anti-aging Treatments Most scientists are skeptical of anti-aging treatments. This is because there is little published evidence from controlled clinical trials to show most anti-aging products have any benefit. You could say this is because private companies don’t want to make their research public, but if they did have meaningful, positive results you can be sure the PR arm of the company would crow about this where ever they could. We’ve seen previously that price is not indicative of the effectiveness of an anti-aging skin treatment . The conclusion was that none of the products were as effective as claimed. Does any treatment work? The only thing that scientists and reputable dermatologists agree on is that application of topical retinoids can repair sun damaged skin and prevent future collagen damage. Oh yeah, and they all say using sunscreen is a good thing. Beyond that, forget about it. Yes, that includes the $95 Perricone Restorative Cream . Vitamin C works when you eat it, not when you slather it on your skin. Lasers for your skin? Recently, lasers and LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes) have been shown to effectively rejuvenate photoaged skin. Cosmetic surgeons have been making lots of money from these treatments and the big cosmetic manufacturers like P&G and L’Oreal are trying to bring you this same treatment at home. But the technology isn’t quite ready. Products you can buy right now like the Beurer Softlaser will likely disappoint. The Beauty Brains bottom line Scientists in the anti-aging field (who are not trying to sell you products) agree, anti-aging products are over-priced and under-deliver. For a 20-something, the best thing you can do is eat right, exercise and avoid long sun exposure. If you’re a bit older, start using skin products that contain vitamin A derivatives. They’re the only thing that has yet been proven to be effective.","What should a 20-something do about aging?","690a127b67143325228faba72c7ae5a2be46b644","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2008/02/what-should-a-20-something-do-about-aging/"
"The Beauty Brains","","What you should know about treating ingrown hairs? by The Beauty Brains Lydia’s Got Ingrown Hair Issues: After I wax my legs and hands, there is a relapse of ingrown hair on my waxed skin. It looks terrible and I have tried treating ,but nothing is working out. Does scrubbing help ? or is there any remedy to cure this skin problem The Right Brain Recommends An Anti-inflammatory: It sounds like you might have a case of folliculitis, a condition in which your hair follicle becomes inflamed. Waxing can irritate the hair follicle which causes dead cells to build up at the site of the irritation and form small pus containing pockets. This blockage can trap the hair as it tries to grow out of the follicle and poof! you`ve got an ingrown hair. Scrubbing will only make things worse so DON’T! In fact, you need to give your follicles a rest for a while until the inflammation dies down. While we’ve never tested them, we have heard good things about the Tendskin product and Paula’s Choice Skin Relief. They both use aspirin, an proven anti-inflammatory, to soothe your skin. If you have to remove more hair, shave instead of waxing because that’s less irritating to the follicle. (By the way, you can go here to see our original post on this subject and click through to see some really disturbing pictures of Follicles Gone Wild. But don’t say we didn’t warn you!)","What you should know about treating ingrown hairs?","a2bb5ea12f44c16167b558df0e846207211fa009","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2007/02/what-you-should-know-about-treating-ingrown-hairs/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Is it safe to expose sunless tanned skin to the sun? by The Beauty Brains Britt asks …I love your website but am not going to rave about it here (I’d rather save the positive comments for my friends so that I can get them hooked too!) My question is about these gradual tanning lotions (e.g. Jergen’s Natural Glow). I have been using this product on and off all Winter (with mediocre results) and plan to keep using it so as to get my money’s worth. Since it is now Summer, however, I am a bit nervous about using the lotion and then going out into the sun. I am not a sun-worshipper but do ride my bike to and from work. Should I be worried about exposing my freshly fake-tanned skin to the Summer sun? Thanks!! The Left Brain enlightens… We’ve previously written about how sunless tanners work but we didn’t answer this question. For the most part, skin that has been treated with a sunless tanner is no more protected or vulnerable than untreated skin. In both cases you should be wearing sunscreen when you go outside (preferably SPF 30). The only safety issue with sunless tanners is that you THINK you might not need to use sunscreen since you’re already tan. In other words, sunless tanners can lull you into a false sense of security so you forget to protect you skin. And that’s dangerous! Difference between sunless and real tans The color on skin from a sunless tanner is chemically different than a real tan. Real tans are the result of melanin in skin. Fake tans are the result of chemical reaction between skin protein and DHA. Can sunless tanners protect skin? Recently, there was a study which showed that a new type of sunless tanner could actually be beneficial. Consider this self-tanner story recently reported by netdoctor . It turns out that this kind of fake tanner may actually have the potential to protect from skin cancer. In a study done on mice, scientists were able to show that extra skin pigmentation from their plant-derived fake tanner was able to help protect DNA from UV damage. Less damage = less skin cancer. This technology is different than the standard DHA containing self tanners you can buy now. Unfortunately, it also isn’t ready for prime time as it hasn’t been proven in humans plus it’s not clear how nice a tan you might get. But it would be nice to do something good for your skin while you protect it. Incidentally, for the entire month of May, The Beauty Addict is reviewing the ins and outs of self tanners. She kicks off the month with self tanner basics . It’s definitely worth a read.","Is it safe to expose sunless tanned skin to the sun?","7ea91c960f6b51fee9d59f5489bdbee316aa97e4","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2007/05/is-it-safe-to-expose-sunless-tanned-skin-to-the-sun/"
"The Beauty Brains","","OMG! Does Chocolate Really Cause Acne? by The Beauty Brains Damn, I hate science sometimes. Contrary to the old wives’ tales that say chocolate is bad for skin, I’ve chosen to believe the prevailing scientific evidence that says diet does NOT contribute to acne. (See our candy post from last Valentines Day). But now a new study says that those old wives may know best after all. Australian acne study NPR reports on an Australian research study that evaluated 54 acne patients, ranging in age from 15 to 25. Half of the patients were given a low blood sugar diet while the other half were allowed to feast on Doritos and M&Ms (and other starchy, sugary foods). After 12 weeks, dermatologists evaluated the skin of all the panelists with out knowing which diet they were on (so it was a well blinded study.) Guess what? The patients on the sugary diet had significantly worse skin. Final proof? This certainly contradicts what previous studies have shown. So is this proof beyond a shadow of doubt that sugar causes acne? Not quite, the report acknowledged that while this study strongly suggests a causal connection between sugar intake and acne there are other factors to consider as well. For example, the patients overall caloric intake and degree of weight loss were not the same. So there may have been other factors at play here beyond sheer sugar consumption. Still, it makes me think twice before gorging myself on my post-holiday stash of Lake Champlain gourmet chocolates . The Beauty Brains bottom line Looks like more research is needed. I hope they hurry up and settle this before Valentine’s Day! What do YOU think? Does your skin break out when you indulge your inner chocolate demons?

"The Beauty Brains","","Does frederic fekkai really treat hair loss? by The Beauty Brains Tamara’s temerity: Hello, Brains. I continue to adore the blog. Now, I humbly come before you again with a beauty query. My question concerns the efficacy of Frederic Fekkai More Nighttime Follicle Boosting Treatment . Freddy claims the following results: “Concentrated, continuous-release dose of niacin; Increases oxygenation of the follicle; Increases energy metabolism for a more vital, fertile scalp.” Is this all so much hype & silliness, or does this (pricey) product stand half a chance of treating thinning hair? The Right Brain finds fault with Fekkai: As we’ve said in previous posts about products that claim to promote hair growth , there are only two products currently proven to work and approved by the FDA. One is Minoxidil and the other is Propecia. Another bulls#@t product? We were all set to rip this product to shreds. But our research uncovered one small detail that lends some unexpected plausibility to Fekkai’s claims: this product contains a pair of niacin-derived ingredients, myristyl nicotinate and ethylhexyl nicotinate. It just so happens that these ingredients are very similar to ones evaluated for follicle stimulation by researchers in a 2006 study . Can Niacin stimulate hair growth? The study in question was a double blind clinical trial conducted by respected dermatologists. The researchers evaluated the effect of topical application of two niacin derivatives (octyl nicotinate and tetradecyl nicotinate) on 60 female subjects with Ludwig types I-III female pattern hair loss. 40 subjects received the niacin treatment, 20 received a placebo. The researchers measured hair fullness by using 35mm photography. After 6 months the study concluded that the panelists who were treated with niacin showed a statistically significant increase in hair fullness. Does this mean Fekkai really works? Not necessarily. While Fekkai does say their Niaplex technology is clinically proven, they don’t present any data (at least none that we could find) showing that they tested their exact formula. We can only speculate how similar their treatment is to the one tested by the dermatologists. There are at least 3 confounding factors at work here. One, Fekkai is not using the same niacin derivatives as used in the study. Two, we don’t know the concentrations of the ingredients. They might just be “ angel dusting .” And three, we don’t know if the formula itself, or the mode of application, makes a difference. The Beauty Brains bottom line Without compelling data on this specific product, we’re skeptical that Fekkai really stimulates follicles. Still, we have to give credit where credit is due. The Fekkai product apparently uses a technology that at least has a theoretical basis for efficacy. And that’s MUCH more than we can say for most hair loss cures. If you’re concerned about thinning hair and you’ve got 35 bucks to blow, you can buy the Fekkai treatment here . Let us know how that works out for you!

"The Beauty Brains","None","Big bad baby hairs by The Beauty Brains Andrea asks: I have a question regarding short “baby-like” hairs that grow around my hairline. I’ve had them ever since I was little and I’m wondering why they never grow out. They’re not due to damage. They’re not long enough to be “fly-aways”, but they’re obvious enough that I’m too embarrassed to pull my hair back in a ponytail. Is there anything I can do, or any product I should use, to help these baby hairs grow out? The Right Brain Replies: We recommend washing your hair with baby shampoo , wearing Baby Phat perfume, dressing in clothes from Bebe, and listening to music by the 70s glam-rock band, The Babys . Joking! Why are some hairs different than others? Seriously though, there’s really nothing you can do to make your “baby hairs” grow out. Their size and shape are determined by the genetics of your hair follicle. Some types of hairs are “programmed” to only grow so thick and so long. You can read more about it in our post on “ Why Armpit Hairs Don’t Grow Down To Your Knees .” I’m sorry that we can’t recommend a product to help you battle baby hairs, but if they really bother you you might consider have electrolysis or laser hair removal.

"The Beauty Brains","","Are you addicted to lip balm? by The Beauty Brains Chris is Curious: Is it really possible to be addicted to lip balm? The Left Beauty Brain’s Lips Respond: Fascinating question, Chris. And you can find an equally fascinating, but a little over-analyzed, discussion on the addictive properties of lip balm at Lip Balm Anonymous . The post is a bit outdated but we found it to be an interesting reference, nonetheless. But the one argument that we did NOT see discussed was, in our opinion, the most scientifically valid one. It goes something like this: Skin signals for new cells Skin is a very complicated organ with multiple layers. The top layer, the stratum corneum, consists mainly of dead, dried up cells. As those cells die and flake off, they send a signal to a deeper layer skin (called the basal layer) to produce fresh skin cells. This is a very simplified description of the process called cellular turnover. (Contrary to what you might have thought, “cellular turnover” does NOT refer to switching your mobile phone plan.) Lip balm slows down the signal When you apply lip balm, you’re creating a barrier layer that prevents, or at least retards, the evaporation of moisture from the inner layers of skin. Since the top layer isn’t drying and flaking off as much, the basal layer never gets the signal to produce new cells. Your skin has to catch up But when you stop using the lip balm, all of a sudden your lips dry out and your basal layer has to hurry up and start producing new cells. But since your lips already feel dry again, you add more lip balm which once again tells the basal layer “hey, everything’s fine up here on the surface – we don’t need any more new skin cells.” The cycle repeats But of course, once that application of lip balm has worn off and there are no new plump, moist skin cells to replace the ones that are drying out, your lips feel dry again and you have to add more lip balm. Etc. etc. etc. Get the picture? That’s why you feel addicted to lip balm – you’ve “trained” you body to rely on it! This theory provides a more scientific explanation for the mysterious Lip Balm Addiction; does it make sense for you lip balm users?","Are you addicted to lip balm?","cd7adf9098c515e7c78c327540555f9544f3a3cc","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2006/05/are-you-addicted-to-lip-balm/"

"The Beauty Brains","2017-10-27 14:06:00","3 ways to tell if your sunscreen is bad by The Beauty Brains Catherine’s Concerned About Sunscreen Efficacy: I’ve heard that when sunscreen/sunblock separates, it`s no longer good. That shaking it up to remix it is basically wasted effort and applying it will do no good at all. Is this true? Can sunscreen go bad? The Left Brain Concurs: Sunscreen formulations are very sensitive creatures. Most UV absorbers are oil soluble, which means they have to be carefully emulsified to form stable mixtures with water. If the oil and water in the formula are not properly coupled together, the whole formula can go to hell pretty quickly. Here are 3 warning signs that your sunscreen has gone sour: 1. Weird consistency The consistency of the product has changed over time and now it’s too thick or too thin to spread properly. The spreadability of sunscreens is crucial to proper application and coverage. If it doesn’t spread right, it won’t work right. 2. Crystalization The active ingredient has crystallized out, making the lotion feel gritty. When this happens the product is completely worthless. You can’t fix that by shaking. 3. Separation The product has separated into two different layers. Also not good. At worst, the active ingredient will partition into the oil phase and shaking it may or may not re-suspend it properly. At best, the water-resistance of the product may be compromised and it will wash off too easily. Either way, it`s really not worth using. Go buy a fresh bottle. The Beauty Brains Bottom Line: Given the importance of good UV protection, don’t take chances with a bottle of sunscreen that you think may be bad. Most manufacturers of sunscreen products like Coppertone , Himaya , Ocean Potion , and even Jack Black, should gladly refund your money or offer you a replacement if you have a problem.","3 ways to tell if your sunscreen is bad","d67d305445cbdfe80948e92b0970628b6933988f","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2007/01/3-ways-to-tell-if-your-sunscreen-is-bad/"
"The Beauty Brains","","How to pop a pimple in 7 easy steps by The Beauty Brains Laurie’s concern: “I have always been told that it’s unhealthy and potentially damaging to squeeze my own zits. I’m not Ivanka Trump and I can’t afford to hire people to squeeze my pimples on a regular basis. Am I really damaging my skin FOREVER if I pop a pimple? Am I any less qualified to pick at my zits than an esthetician? It doesn’t seem like rocket science to me.” The Right Brain’s reply: Our suggestion is to play the Lotto. When you win, you’ll be able to hire pimple poppers like the rest of us. In fact, the Left Brain and I use hired help to pop pimples, file warts and, on occasion, lance boils. That’s just our way of contributing to the capitalistic culture of cosmetics. But seriously, by squeezing your own zits you might make them worse. According to the American Academy of Dermatologists, you should NOT pick, scratch, pop, or squeeze pimples yourself because you`ll get more redness, swelling, inflammation, and possible scarring. (If you want to learn more about the causes and effects of acne, read our previous posts .) But, if you INSIST on throwing caution to the winds and picking those pus pockets yourself, here are 7 easy steps to popping your own pimples (courtesy of Acne.org .) 1. Take a warm shower or bath to soften your skin. 2. Wash your face and remove all makeup. ( Here’s the best way to do that .) 3. Wash your hands to prevent spreading germs and infecting the pimple. 4. Sterilize a needle…(a dirty needle will cause an infection and maybe a bigger pimple). 5. Gently prick the tip of the pimple with the needle. 6. Take a clean tissue or piece of toilet paper and wrap it around your index fingers. 7. Gently apply pressure to the sides of the pimple to ease out the pus. Stop when blood or clear fluid comes out.","How to pop a pimple in 7 easy steps","8b990f7475671c9ee1a52c43646ee863ec3e68d7","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2007/05/how-to-pop-a-pimple-in-7-easy-steps/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Like celebrities, fragrances can go bad by The Beauty Brains Erin asks: Does perfume expire and if it does is it bad to use it? Sarah Bellum sniffs out a response: Since I have the biggest fragrance collection of all the Beauty Brains , I told Lefty I’d answer your question, Erin. Here’s the scoop: Perfume chemistry It takes dozens, sometimes HUNDREDS! of different chemicals to make perfume smell so sweet. Some of those chemicals can react with each other and change over time. (If you wanna be a real geek about it you can learn more by reading the Brains’ Fragrance Science series. ) These reactions can make fragrances “go bad” over time. When that happens some of the scents change and the fragrance doesn’t smell as pretty. So once a fragrance expires you’ll know it because you just won’t like it anymore. Can it be bad for your skin? Lots of people have fragrance allergies, so it make sense that if the chemistry of the fragrance is changing over time, you could become more irritated by it. But it’s not like BOOM all of a sudden your favorite fragrance is going to make you break out in a rash. So chances are you don’t need to worry about that. How long does perfume last How long does it take for a fragrance to expire? Can’t say for sure, because there are sooo many different chemicals in each perfume. But in general a fragrance should be ok for about 2 years. If you keep it away from light and store it in the refrigerator, you can make it last a lot longer. Of course, it depends on which fragrance you’re talking about. Celebrity fragrances, for example, are much less stable than regular ones. Let’s take a peek at some: “Fantasy” by Britney Spears shouldn’t last any longer than her marriage to KFed. “Starlight” by Shania Twain will probably expire before you even buy it, considering how long her career has been over. “Fetish” by Christina Aguilera will be very unstable unless it’s covered up better than she was on the cover of Marie Claire. “With Love” by Hilary Duff. Not sure about this one, I get mixed it up with Duff Beer fragrance from the Simpsons. How long do YOU keep fragrances? Do you use them up before they go bad or do you end up throwing them away?

"The Beauty Brains","","Deep Dark Secrets About Under Eye Dark Circles by The Beauty Brains With the rest of the Beauty Brains taking a break to work on their book, I thought this would be a good time for guest blogger Dr. Brett Kotlus to teach us about dark circles. Take it away Dr. Brett: During consultations in my cosmetic surgery practice, patients commonly ask about dark circles under their eyes. Some have been asked by friends if they have a black eye, and others hear comments about how they look tired. I hear many stories about people who have tried all sorts of store-bought treatments and home remedies. The problem with each of these individual “fixes” is that there is a long list of reasons why the dark circles appear, each requiring different approaches for improvement. There is no single “magic bullet” for all under-eye circles, and I am wary of any product that claims to universally remove them. What causes the dark circles? Thin skin: Interestingly, the eyelid skin is the thinnest in the body, sometimes only several cells thick! In those with extremely thin skin, the underlying muscle (orbicularis oculi) and/or blood vessels may become visible. This muscle is composed of reddish, circular fibers that be seen through the skin as a blue to purple area. This skin may become thinner with age, dehydration, and with long-term use of topical retinoids to name a few causes. Remedies in this situation include the use of concealers, maintaining body and skin hydration by drinking plenty of water and using moisturizers, and skin thickening therapies. Dark shadows: Sometimes those dark circles are illusions caused by shadowing. In people with extra skin, bulging fat, excess fluid retention, or under-eye hollowing, lighting from above will cast shadows under the eyes. The way to fix this is by correcting the underlying cause of fluid retention (sleeping with your head elevated can help), adding fillers or fat grafting to eliminate hollow grooves, skin tighteningsuch as resurfacing procedures, and lower blepharoplasty, to remove or reposition fat pouches. Blood vessels: The eyelids have a rich blood supply by way of many vessels found under the skin. Prominent, dilated, or superficially located vessels, or blood pooling in networks of veins can sometimes be seen through thin skin, and this blood may be apparent as dark areas or lines. Again, concealers may disguise this problem. Surgical closure of these vessels, sclerotherapy, and laser treatment are more definitive options, but may be somewhat riskier. Skin pigmentation: An accumulation of pigment in the eyelid skin (melanocytosis) is another cause of dark circles. This pigment can be present at birth or develop later in life. Others develop hyperpigmentation after episodes of inflammation or allergy, the so-called “post inflammatory hyperpigmentation”. It can also be related to medications such as glaucoma drops and oral estrogens. Sun exposure can also worsen patches of facial pigment, sometimes called “melasma”. The first step in treatment is identifying any offending agents and eliminating them. Other steps include topical depigmenting agents, Q-switched lasers, intense pulsed light, and fractional photothermolysis. What should you do? The first step in treating those annoying dark circles is identifying the problem. The best way to do this is by enlisting the help of a doctor who has special training in this area, such as an oculofacial plastic surgeon or a dermatologist. They can suggest a skin care regimen that might include hydroquinone (a skin-lightener), a moisturizer, and a sunscreen. If a surgical option such as blepharoplasty or laser treatment is appropriate, ask them about their specific training in that procedure and how many they have performed. Most importantly, be suspicious of products and infomercials that claim to eliminate all dark lines because you now know it can be a complicated problem requiring a complicated solution, like many things in life.

"The Beauty Brains","","Do shave minimizing lotions work? by The Beauty Brains Glitterati want to know: Do “hair growth inhibiting” products like Jergen’s Shave Minimizing Lotion really work? The Right Beauty Brain’s Rigorously Researched Response: Uh, not really. The hairy truth These products don’t reduce the rate at which hair grows and they don’t even do much to reduce the hair that’s already grown out! We agree with the assessment of the folks over at Hairfacts , whom we quote: Does it remove or reduce hair? No. Does it make hair appear less noticeable? Maybe. Does daily use make shaving easier? Quite probably. Does daily use allow you to shave less often? Maybe. Is it better at softening hair than any other extra-strength moisturizer? Not been proven. This lotion contains a lot of heavy emollients (softeners) and a mild amount of an alkaline solution used to dissolve hair. That pretty much sums it up. Products like the Jergen’s lotion actually claim to help make hair softer, finer, and less noticeable. That does NOT mean they slow down how fast the hair grows back, which is what they imply. (By the way, we doubt that there is sufficient alkali in the lotion to make a difference because products like this are designed to be left on skin and true depilatories must be rinsed off because prolonged skin contact will cause irritation.) Finally, as Hairfacts points out, “The only quantitative claim they need to back up is their claim that it lets you shave “half as often.” If you shave every day or so, you might be able to go every other day or so.” The Beauty Brain’s bottom line: Sorry, looks like you’ll have to keep shaving.","Do shave minimizing lotions work?","3c044efc66e81cd4dd817fa94a539ec2ad4d5791","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2006/05/do-shave-minimizing-lotions-work/"
"The Beauty Brains","2015-07-31 07:27:00","Does mineral oil cause zits? by The Beauty Brains When you’ve been in the beauty business long enough you learn that you can`t believe everything you read. Take the information about mineral oil from this website for example. They make many claims about the evils of mineral oil. It`s suggested that big companies use mineral oil because it`s inexpensive even though they know it is dangerous and can cause disease and acne. When you come across information like this you should always ask yourself, what is the motivation for writing it? And surprise, surprise the people writing this information are trying to sell you skin products that don`t contain mineral oil. They use this scare tactic to convince their consumers not to buy from mainstream skin product manufacturers but instead buy from them. The truth is mineral oil is a perfectly safe ingredient that has been used in skin products for many years. It acts as a barrier on the skin and helps to prevent moisture loss. There is no scientifically valid evidence that it dries the skin, causes premature aging, or even removes vitamins from the skin. The one knock against mineral oil is that there has been some evidence that mineral oil is comedogenic, that is, it causes acne. But now scientists have made the discovery that mineral oil won`t give you zits ! In this study published in the Journal of Cosmetic Dermatology, Joseph DiNardo found that the cosmetic grade of mineral oil used in beauty products is not comedogenic. What the authors of this study suggest is that consumers should look for products that claim to be non-comedogenic not mineral oil free. Before you fall into the trap of believing everything you read ask yourself, why would these authors write something positive about mineral oil? Well, they are scientists who are investigating a question and endeavoring to get something published in a premiere scientific journal. This isn`t easy either because their evidence is scrutinized by other scientists in the field. Their conclusions aren`t biased by the fact that they are trying to sell you their product. And that lack of bias and scrutiny of their peers makes the information much more believable.","Does mineral oil cause zits?","5fcda6bca7cd48f277ee85a5c505a6f56d7a05ce","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2006/05/does-mineral-oil-cause-zits/"
"The Beauty Brains","","The coolest cornstarch video you’ll ever see by The Beauty Brains Sarah is Skeptical: I just read your post about talc causing cancer . You said it hasn’t been proven to be unsafe but I’m still not convinced. Therefore, I’m looking for products that use talc alternatives, like cornstarch. What do you think of cornstarch-based powders? The Right Brain Gets Corny: Cornstarch is a common ingredient in many powder-based formulations. Depending on what else is in the formula, it can be a good substitute for talc. The only problem with cornstarch is that it will absorb water much more easily than talc so products can cake and stick if they`re not formulated properly. But the coolest thing about cornstarch is the way it changes its behavior when mixed with water. It forms a paste that flows like a liquid but if you quickly apply force to it, it acts like a solid. You have to see this to believe it, so watch this video . Some wacky students filled a swimming pool with a mix of cornstarch and water made on a concrete mixer truck. When stress is applied to the liquid it exhibits properties of a solid so they’re able to run across the top of it without sinking. But as soon as they stop running, they sink. Geeky? Yes, but very cool in a Beauty Brains kind of way!","The coolest cornstarch video you’ll ever see","74fee825fc992ac54244ccbba0281dc5074d8b36","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2007/01/the-coolest-cornstarch-video-youll-ever-see/"
"The Beauty Brains","2016-10-16 23:37:00","Does red palm oil in HTY gold really hide the years? by The Beauty Brains Suzanne’s skincare search: My mother has a skin condition that makes her skin look dry and fragile. She read about something called HTY Gold and wondered if this all natural product can help as it claims. Any opinions or research on this product? The Right Brain’s response: The first thing we learned about HTY Gold is that the “HTY” stands for “Hide The Years.” The second thing we learned is that it’s secret ingredient is Red Palm Oil. Keep reading to see what else we learned… Who Makes HTY Gold? HTY Gold is brought to us by Pacific Specialty Oils, Inc. and was formulated by cofounder George Kopas, who is a chemist. Their website has an interesting quote from George regarding “regular” skin moisturizers. He say: “Why would anybody think that these creams would work against ageing skin? Look at the ingredients they are made with chemicals, water and preservatives. The water in these creams evaporate off of your skin and leave you with chemicals that can actually harm your skin.” This quote seems bit intellectually dishonest to us for two reasons. First, it implies that regular lotions are bad for your skin just because they contain chemicals. As regular readers of the Beauty Brains know, EVERYTHING is a chemical. Saying that something is bad just because it’s a chemical is ridiculous; there are good chemicals and bad chemicals. Second, saying that regular lotions contain water that just “evaporates off your skin” implies that regular lotions don’t work at all. This is also a ridiculous statement. We work in this industry, and we know there are many safe and efficacious skin lotion brands that contain water. Water is a good diluent for certain active ingredients and it helps hydrate the surface of skin. If George has to resort to scare tactics like this to make HTY Gold look better than other (much cheaper) products, it’s a huge red flag in terms of the brand’s validity. What’s so special about HTY Gold? HTY Gold is all about Palm Oil. Two of its primary ingredients are regular Palm Oil and Red Palm Oil. (Red Palm Oil is an unprocessed version of Palm Oil, which loses its red color as it’s heated. Red Palm Oil is rich in betacarotenes, tocotrienols, co-enzyme Q10 (ubiquinone), squalene and Vitamins A and E that make it more healthful if you’re ingesting it. However, those components don’t necessarily mean it’s better for your skin. In case you’d like to see it, here’s the full ingredient list: Elaeis Guineensis (Palm Oil), Theobroma Cacao Seed Butter (Cocoa Butter), Red Elaeis Guineensis (Red Palm Super Olein), Limnanthes Alba (Meadowfoam Seed Oil), Oenothera Biennis (Evening Primrose Oil), Triticum Vulgaree (Wheat Germ Oil), Lecithin If you want an oil based moisturizer, this could be a very good product. But it’s not better because it’s chemical free or because it lacks preservatives. (Plus, it’s very expensive!) Is HTY Gold worth the cost? The Day Gold product is $160 for 3.4 oz. If you shop around you might be able to find other skin creams with similar ingredients for much less money. Pacific Oils are not the only source of Red Palm Oil – you can buy a gallon of Red Palm Oil for $34 on Amazon.com! Since this product is essentially a mixture of oils, it might be fairly easy to buy your own ingredients and mix up your own version at home. That’s something to think about, especially if you’re into DIY cosmetics. The Beauty Brains bottom line HTY Gold is charging a LOT of money for their product without giving us adequate reason to believe it’s worth it. They have a formula that does seem relatively unique, but they make some unsound scientific statements about their product that makes us doubt their credibility. If it weren’t so expensive, we’d definitely recommend giving it a try just to see if this unique blend of oils helps your mother’s skin. But the price is so absurd; we can’t in good conscience recommend it without more proof. Are you aware of the controversy about Palm Oil? Some groups claim that mass harvesting ofpalm trees has a damaging effect on the environment because it increases global warming. Has anyone in the Beauty Brains community used Red Palm Oil ?

"The Beauty Brains","","Finally An Affordable Wrinkle Treatment That Works by The Beauty Brains We here at the Beauty Brains almost always end up telling you about things that don’t work. We try to be positive but there is just so much Beauty Care BS we may start to sound like cynics.However, in our hearts and souls we hold out hope and dream of better beauty products. So, when we see something that is proven to really work, we love to report it. A recent study about the effect of Vitamin A on wrinkles and skin aging is one such development. According to researchers, work done at the University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, showed that a vitamin A (Retinol) lotion was effective in reducing wrinkles, roughness and overall skin aging. In the study, the scientists took suitably wrinkly volunteers (average age of 87) and applied lotions to either their right or left upper, inner arms. One lotion was a placebo and the other contained 0.4% retinol. They did this for 3 times a week for 24 weeks. Happily, they found that the skin was significantly improved. The authors theorize that the extra vitamin A likely increases collagen production and helps the skin retain water. The best part is this is a study published in a PEER REVIEWED journal (Arch Dermatol. 2007;143:606-612) and not just some clinical study conducted by a biased company. It’s this extra level of proof that is new. Beauty Brains Bottom Line So, what does this mean for you? Well, if you are concerned about wrinkles be sure to find a skin lotion that contains vitamin A or retinol. Of course, this won’t guarantee your skin will improve since companies can put tiny amounts in the formulas and still say it’s in there, but at least there is a chance it will help.","Finally An Affordable Wrinkle Treatment That Works","2f78731d04abe84dedb53d5b17f7ff623902145e","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2007/05/finally-an-affordable-wrinkle-treatment-that-works/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Should you believe it if consumer reports says expensive wrinkle creams are not better? by The Beauty Brains While we had mentioned this in one of our Beauty Brains polls , we never discussed the full story. According to a study done by Consumer Reports , you are wasting your money if you buy expensive wrinkle reducing face creams. According to CR, there is no connection between price and effectiveness. Of course, it’s not surprising to the Beauty Brains . Since we know the raw materials that go into both ultra expensive and ultra cheap beauty products, we can sincerely report retail price doesn’t always reflect formula quality. Most interesting about the study was the conclusion that no cream was noticeably effective. Some had slight improvements but none were deemed worth it. In lab studies, CR found the most effective product was Olay Regenerist (Enhancing Lotion, Perfecting Cream and Daily Regenerating Serum). One surprise was a $335 product scored among the lowest of all the products tried. The full list (in order of performance) is as follows. Best to Worst – Wrinkle Reducing Creams 1. Olay Regnerist : $57 2. Lancome Paris Renergie: $176 3. RoC Retin-Ox+ : $135 4. Neutogena Visibly Firm Night Cream w Active Copper : $38 5. Avon Anew Alternative Age Treatment : $64 6.

RoC Retinol Correxion Deep Wrinkle : $40 Consumer Reports and Beauty Products Now, we here at the Beauty Brains love magazines like Consumer Reports. We completely support what they are trying to do. However, in some ways their results are suspect. It is not as good as peer reviewed research. Consider this true story that happened to one of the Beauty Brains. Years ago, Consumer Reports did a study comparing a large number of shampoo formulas. They tested properties like foam, detangling, conditioning, etc. Then all the products were rated. Coincidentally, two formulas that one Beauty Brain had created were in the study. The only difference between these 2 formulas was the color, the fragrance, a couple of “claims” ingredients and the name. In all other ways the formulas were the same. In the study however, the formulas scored differently. One product was called a great value while the other was rated only mediocre. If they tested them thoroughly, this should not have happened. Ever since then, I’ve always been a bit skeptical of Consumer Reports studies. Beauty Brains’ bottom line While Consumer Reports has noble intentions, you shouldn’t always rely on their conclusions. They are not experts in the product areas that they test so they’re apt to make mistakes. Having said that, we agree with the results of this particular study…don’t waste your money on high priced wrinkle creams. They aren’t worth it.","Should you believe it if consumer reports says expensive wrinkle creams are not better?","ac0363e7408616b4376517298d8aff81aed61a99","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2007/05/should-you-believe-it-if-consumer-reports-says-expensive-wrinkle-creams-are-not-better/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Are silicones bad for your hair? by The Beauty Brains Diane’s Undaunted By Silicones For Silkier Hair : The question of silicone’s usefulness has long being a subject of intense debate, speculation and confusion in Long Hair Community. As a consequence, a lot of members in Long Hair Community are wary of using silicone-heavy products, such as Pantene conditioner. Dimethicone, Cyclomethicone and whatnot are allegedly harder to rinse out, therefore build-up occurs faster than a silicone-free hair regimen. As for me, I love how cones smooth and soften my hair big time – while in shower. Sadly, the miraculous silkiness vanishes as soon as my hair dries. So I use unrefined coconut oil to successfully add shine, softness and protection for my hair. My questions are these: Are cones really harder to rinse out? How do they work on hair? Do they dry hair out? And why does that wonderful silkiness disappear when my hair dries? How do carrier oils like coconut oil, sweet almond oil compare to silicones? The Right Brain Comments on ‘Cones for Conditioning : Diane, you raise some very good questions. In general, silicones work by covering hair with a thin hydrophobic (water-proof) coating. This coating serves several purposes: it helps reduce the porosity of the hair which makes it less likely to absorb humidity; it helps reduce moisture loss from the inside of the hair; and it lubricates the surface of the hair so it feel smoother and combs easier. The properties vary depending on which particular silicone is in the formula. Some silicones do leave a heavy coating on the hair that can be hard to wash off. Others are very water soluble and don’t buildup at all. Dimethicone, (sometimes called simethicone ) for example, is the heaviest of all silicones used for hair care . It provides the most smoothing effect but it is also the hardest to wash out. Cyclomethicone on the other hand, gives great slippery feeling while you’re rinsing your hair, but it quickly evaporates leaving nothing behind. This is probably what you`re experiencing. What about carrier oils, as you describe them? Some oils are effective conditioners. Take coconut oil, for example. While it doesn`t provide the same surface smoothing as silicones, it has been shown to penetrate hair and plasticize the cortex, making hair stronger. (This isn’t true of all natural oils however.) So oils are useful ingredients but they’re not direct replacements for silicones. The Brains Bottom Line : It`s tough to tell simply from reading the label because there are so many types of silicones and they can be used in combination with each other. You can’t simply say: all silicones are bad. Some women will find silicones too heavy for their hair, others will love the soft, conditioned feel they provide. You’ll have to experiment to find what’s right for you. Good luck!","Are silicones bad for your hair?","63d3363b5355e6fa65c0d2b4ba4d9acb11c4041f","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2007/01/are-silicones-bad-for-your-hair/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Can I put caffeine on my skin instead of drinking coffee? by The Beauty Brains Beautiful Barrista wants to know : I read about a caffeinated soap that supposedly gives you the same jolt as drinking coffee. Does it really work? The Right Brain brews up this response: Barrista is referring to Shower Shock bar soap which, according to CosmeticsDesign , gives you the equivalent of 2 cups of coffee worth of caffeine every time you shower. This claim seemed a bit outrageous, so we did some digging. And guess what? Based on the published data, this is absolutely true! Imagine that “ no more morning trips to Starbucks. No more messing with coffee grounds and filters! Now you can save a bundle on lattes while you lather up in the comfort of your own bathroom! Isn`t that amazing??? Oh, wait a minute. There`s just one catch. Bear with us here while we crunch the numbers. First, how much caffeine is in a cup of coffee? It’s about 100 milligrams. So for two cups you`re looking at swallowing 200 mg. Can Shower Shock match that? Let`s see¦ We have to establish that caffeine really does penetrate through skin into your blood. And indeed it does, according to PubMed . In fact, the diffusion rate for caffeine through human skin is 2.2 x 10-6 grams per centimeter squared of skin, per hour. Ok, so now we know how much caffeine can penetrate 1 square centimeter of skin per hour. And since we know that the average human body has approximately 40,000 square centimeters of skin (look it up if you don’t believe us!), we can calculate how much caffeine can penetrate your entire body. According to my ciphering, that means your skin can absorb about 100 mg of caffeine in about an hour. So that means you`d have to stand in the shower for 2 HOURS before you`d get the equivalent of 2 cups of coffee in your system. That trip to Starbucks doesn`t seem like that bad of a deal now, does it? Of course, we made some assumptions in this calculation, and if the fine folks who make Shower Shock would care to share their data, we`d gladly reconsider our findings. But without some kind of data to the contrary, this sounds like Marketing hype to the Beauty Brains . (And the same goes for other skin care products with caffeine, like Replenex.) It also makes us wonder: do you think the people who make Shower Shock have heard that putting caffeine on your skin can stop skin cancer?","Can I put caffeine on my skin instead of drinking coffee?","c2c2d057b6f6409da32bfc7224339f95e49bda17","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2007/05/can-i-put-caffeine-on-my-skin-instead-of-drinking-coffee/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Top 10 strange uses for human hair by The Beauty Brains You know when you get your hair cut and there’s just a pile of it left on the floor? Did you ever wonder what happens to it? In most cases, it’s just thrown in the trash, but sometimes it’s used for other purposes. Here are some. 10 Uses For Human Hair 1. Wig making . This one is pretty obvious, but it helps thousands of people each year to cope with losing their hair. A human hair wig looks natural and is incredibly durable. Most donated hair goes into wig making. 2. Test tress making . When cosmetic chemists design hair products they need to test them on the real thing. Companies like the De Meo Brothers or International Hair Importers provide tresses, weaves and mannequin heads all made of human hair. And if you were wondering how much hair is worth, 1 oz cost $40. That’s over $600 a pound! 3. Help people grow food . A company called SmartGrow uses imported human hair from China and India to make a gardening product. The hair is weaved into mats that help protect the plant’s roots from weather and insects. So, maybe it’s not the cook’s hair in your salad . 4. Clean-up Oil Spills . Some years ago NASA was testing a technique to use human hair to clean up ocean oil spills . No word on whether this made it out of the prototype stage. They should use my hair for this experiment because it is always oily! 5. Make clothes . Some people have weaved hair into a fabric and made clothes. Style dash recently reported on a dress made this way . And this barber has even made a hair bikini. While the dress looks good, I’m not sure I want to wear it or the hair bikini. 6. Create furniture . When you spend all day cutting people’s hair you have the strangest ideas. Here is an ex-assistant hairdresser who managed to create a chair out of human hair . The fiber is spun into a material like fiberglass and forged into the shape of a chair. Great idea but I wonder how long it would last . 7. Craft a work of art . It took 42,000 hair cuts, but artist Wenda Gu was able to create a giant banner using human hair . It was first displayed at Dartmouth College’s Baker-Berry Library. It’s no Mona Lisa but it is interesting . 8. Making soy sauce . As if you needed another reason to avoid things made in China. Here is a company that used human hair to make soy sauce . Since human hair is rich in protein, they were able to treat it, remove the amino acids, and pass it off as soybean oil. Wow, I didn’t really want to know that . 9. Nesting material . Birds will use almost anything to make nests and human hair is no exception. This bird watching site even suggests putting out bags of hair clippings to help birds make nests. Here’s someone who uses hair clippings to provide a nest for their pet rat . It’s nice when people help animals. I just hope they shampooed before cutting . 10. Crafting a rope . Native Americans were known to twist hair fibers together to make strong ropes. Eventually, they used horsehair but there are still people who practice the art. Not surprising. There are people who collect toenails too . If you are interested in seeing your hair go somewhere other than a landfill, consider donating it to one of these worthy causes .","Top 10 strange uses for human hair","78c025c4d6dedc2853ae87b668f2f476e103996c","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2007/12/top-10-strange-uses-for-human-hair/"

"The Beauty Brains","","How to tell if you need a facial by The Beauty Brains Cheong`s Facing A Facial: Do I really need to get a facial to get a perfect complexion or is just cleansing and moisturizing at home enough? If I do need facials, how often should I get them? The Right Brain Replies: The first question is: why should you get a facial in the first place? What good does it really do? The answer depends on what kind of facial you get and who does it. According to the American Academy of Dermatologists, Facial rejuvenation can effectively reduce wrinkles, treat sun spots, tighten loose skin, improve skin tone and color, remove blotchiness, and eliminate damaged blood vessels. They discuss 9 types of facial treatments including the use of Topical Products; Fillers and Botox ; Chemical Peels; Dermabrasion and Microdermabrasion; Laser Resurfacing; Radiofrequency Technologies; Photodynamic Therapy; Surgical Excision; and Liposuction. If your complexion is really messed up, you may need one or more of these procedures to get it back in shape. Most of these procedures must be performed by a doctor but a beautician or aesthetician can help you with topical products, chemical peels, and dermabrasion. Depending on the condition of your skin, these treatments may need to be repeated for best results. There`s no way to know how many treatments you`ll need or how often you`ll need them without actually examining your skin. If your complexion just needs a touch up then you really only need basic facial care like cleansing, exfoliation, massage, and extraction of blackheads. If that`s all your skin needs, The Beauty Brains say that there`s no reason you can`t do that yourself at home. Of course, it`s always more pampering to have someone do it for you, but there`s no technical reason you couldn`t do it yourself. (Oh, and if you`re wondering about speciality treatments like oxygen mists or collagen sheets that spas offer, don`t worry about them too much. While they may feel great, they have little functional effect on your skin.)","How to tell if you need a facial","302f5a0cf3a52d6ab915b1ef084ab2b5d254d6eb","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2007/01/how-to-tell-if-you-need-a-facial/"
"The Beauty Brains","2016-07-27 08:23:00","Is bio ionic hair straightener better? by The Beauty Brains Marie’s bemused by Bio Ionic: I’m considering getting my hair permanently straightened using the Bio Ionic thermal straightening process. I did a bit of research but the information seems a bit too sciencey and kind of what you’d expect from infomercials. The website talks about “negative ionic, infrared and electromagnetic wave charges simultaneously” and shattering “water molecule clusters into micro-fine particles.” My alarm bells are ringing but I know The Beauty Brains will be able to confirm or deny! This doesn’t come cheap either – I’m looking at $300 to $600 for something that may or may not leave my hair straight. Is this really the “biggest evolutionary leap in hairdressing ever” or the biggest load of bull? The Right Brain’s recommendation: The answer lies somewhere in between but probably closer to “bull.” What is Bio Ionic? Bio Ionic Inc., was founded by professional stylist Fernando Romero. According to his website, Fernando traveled to Japan where he discovered natural ion therapy. Today Bio Ionic has an entire line of products using this “powerful healing energy.” What does Bio Ionic supposedly do? The main claim of the line revolves around these natural ions that are “powerful enough to break water molecule clusters into micro-fine particles and penetrate the hair shaft. That means moisture balance is restored and the hair cuticle is sealed.” It’s a great sounding story, but it doesn’t really mean all that much in terms of real science. Water will penetrate into a hair shaft just fine without being converted into pseudo-scientific micro-fine particles, thank you very much. Of course, that doesn’t stop Bio Ionic from using this natural ion complex in their shampoos, conditioner, and styling products as well as their line of styling tools (blow dryers, flat irons, etc.). Perhaps the most interesting product in their line is their so called Ion-Retexturizing System which is a “permanent straightening process designed for people with curly, frizzy or unruly hair who want to wear their hair permanently straight.” Does Bio Ionic really work? Their website contains a FAQ section that reveals Ion-retexturizing formula is based on Thioglycolate at pH 9.5 with a Neutralizer at pH 3.0. This chemistry will be very familiar to anyone who has had their hair permed. Thioglycolate is used to chemically break down the disulfide bonds in hair and the low pH neutralizer reforms the bonds to lock the hair into a new shape. This is old school technology used in a perms to to take straight hair and change its shape to curly. But there’s no reason that you can’t use the same chemistry to take curly hair and make it straight. So the answer is yes, Bio Ionic will straighten your hair. But unlike a regular perm, Bio Ionics uses heat to boost the straightening power of the treatment. So, the answer is YES, this product will do what it says. It will permanently straighten your hair. But it has nothing to do with micro-fine natural ions. Why is Bio Ionic so expensive? You’re paying for the time and expertise of the stylist doing the procedure. Despite Bio Ionic’s claims to the contrary, if you’re not careful you can seriously damage your hair. (They are correct though, it is less damaging than other chemical straighteners like relaxers.) The Beauty Brains bottom line Bio Ionic’s Ion-Retexturizing System uses a combination of permanent wave chemistry and heat to effectively straighten your hair. But there is no special science or technology in their natural ion therapy that makes this product work. What’s YOUR favorite hair straightening product? Do you use styling tools like Farouk’s Straightening Iron , chemical processes like Motions Relaxer , or styling products like Philip B Drop Dead Straightening Baum ?

"The Beauty Brains","","4 ways to avoid antiperspirant irritation by The Beauty Brains Fire Pits has a fire in her pits: Is there any ingredient other than aluminum that works as an antiperspirant? I ask not because I am afraid of getting Alzheimer’s, but because the antiperspirants I’ve tried make me itch like mad. The Right Brain responds: I hear you girl, antiperspirants can be itchy and irritating, especially after shaving. But as far as the Alzheimer’s connection is concerned, you’re wise to be skeptical. There’s no proof that aluminum antiperpirants cause Alzheimer’s . But here are 4 ways you can switch to avoid that itch: 1. Switch to deodorant instead of antiperspirant. Deodorants don’t contain aluminum so they’re less likely to make you itch. But remember, they won’t stop you from sweating they’ll only reduce body odor. Confused? Go read our previous post on the difference between deodorants and antiperspirants . 2. Switch to prescription Botox Botox? Yes, Botox injections are approved by the FDA as a way to sweating. Unlike the Aluminum salts which work by plugging the sweat glands, Botox works by disrupting the chemical messages sent by nerve endings that trigger the sweat gland to produce sweat. Of course they’re expensive and you need a prescription from your doctor, but hey – it’s an option! 3. Switch to another antiperspirant brand There are 18 different Aluminum compounds allowed in antiperspirants and some of these can be more irritating than others. Most products use either Aluminum chlorohydrate or Aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrex gly. Look at the active ingredient listed on your product, then switch to a brand that uses a different active see if the problem goes away. 4. Switch to a “regular” strength antiperspirant Extra strength antiperspirants contain higher levels of the active ingredients which could be more irritating to your skin. Try “regular” instead of super-duper and see if that reduces the itching. We hope this helps – you might also want to read our previous post on the top 10 skin irritants . Let us know if your pits are still in peril.","4 ways to avoid antiperspirant irritation","b23cfebd1e59f35ca5bb59b89dae114345852992","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2007/05/4-ways-to-avoid-antiperspirant-irritation/"
"Perry Romanowski","","Anti-acne gadget: the-thermaclear zit zapper by Perry Romanowski Hi Beauty Brains Fans! Sarah Bellum here with another product review. Today I’m talking about the ThermaClear Zit Zapper . What is Thermaclear? It’s hand held electronic device that kills acne causing bacteria with a pulse of heat. It puts pimple pulsing power in the palm of your hand! ThermaClear uses proprietary Thermal Pulse Technology to deliver a controlled burst of heat that reaches beneath the surface of the skin to neutralize the bacteria that cause acne and accelerate healing. It’s similar to laser treatment technology dermatologists use to treat mild-to-moderate acne. (By the way, if this sounds familiar to you, you might have seen our previous post on Zeno , another zit zapper.) Does Thermaclear Really Work? If you’ve read The Beauty Brains post on the causes of acne , you know that bacteria feast on excess oil and skin cells and cause inflammation. Thermaclear works on a very simple principle – you can kill the nasty little buggers with a blast of heat instead of acne medication: Unlike topical acne treatments, which are designed to prevent new breakouts and typically should be given 6 to 8 weeks to work, ThermaClear is designed to treat pimples after they appear. And, with no medicines involved, ThermaClear delivers healing thermal energy that clears without over-drying your skin. And yes, it does work, although it’s not 100% effective. The first few pimples I tried it on literally dried up over night. But I didn’t always see such miraculous results. So I gave it the acid test and gave it to my teen-age nephew to use. He said he uses it twice daily, once before school and once after. When I asked him if it helped his acne he replied “Uh, I guess it’s better.” So then I asked him why he’s using it twice every day if he’s not sure it’s working. His insightful response was “I dunno.” Fortunately we don’t have to rely only his stirring testimony as proof that it works. Therative, the company that makes Thermaclear, have clinical studies that prove the efficacy of their little gadget. They’ve shown it can help clear up pimples 2 to 4 times faster than untreated pimples. (It would be interesting to see how Thermaclear compares to regular acne meds like Sal acid and BP but, alas, they didn’t test it that way. What Are the Pros and Cons of Thermaclear? Its advantages are that it’s quick and easy to use. You control it through 2 buttons: Simply turn on ThermaClear, place the treatment tip on the pimple and press the pulse button. Treatment time is 2-seconds per pimple. It’s that simple. It’s also small enough to carry around with you, which I liked. Disadvantages are it’s mildly painful (maybe I’m a wimp, the afore-mentioned teen-ager didn’t have a problem with pain even on the highest setting.) And, it can be time consuming if you have a lot of zits because you have to treat each pimple individually. But the biggest disadvantage is it’s price. At $150, it can be very painful in the purse! Sarah Bellum’s Bottom Line: Thermaclear Zit Zapper is based on real science and it’s certainly worth trying if you have an acne problem. If you can afford it.","Anti-acne gadget: the-thermaclear zit zapper","975b3f8a99bcfa867b73d6c5824ed2150bf5421a","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2007/05/anti-acne-gadget-the-thermaclear-zit-zapper/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Which mineral makeup is best? by The Beauty Brains Mary Jane asks… Have you published your report on mineral makeup and I just missed it? If so, how do I find it? If it is still in the works, when can we all learn more about this revolution in face products? Really looking forward to this one! The Right Brain responds: No, Mary Jane, you didn’t miss anything. We’ve been promising you a report on Mineral Makeup for over a year! All the research is done and we assigned our intern, Mid Brain, to turn the info into a PDF that we could email to our readers. Unfortunately, Mid Brain was not really up to the task, so all that research has just been sitting on the shelf. Until now. (By the way, don’t think Mid Brain is getting off the hook for letting us all down on this assignment. Stay tuned for more on Mid Brain’s punishment). Rather than waiting until we can figure out the best way to publish the entire report, we decided that today we would just blog about one of the top rated brands in our study. But first, we’ll tell you about our rating scale. Mineral makeup research We surveyed 75 of the top mineral makeup and rated them on the following criteria: Mineral Purity Do they truly contain minerals only or are they diluted with other materials? We ranked all the brands on an A, B, C scale with A being the purest mineral quality. Talc and Bismuth Free While technically talc and bismuth are safe materials, many women are concerned about these chemicals and would prefer minerals cosmetics that are talc and bismuth free. To make the top of the top, mineral makeup brands had to be formulated without these ingredients. Price We found that brands claiming to contain pure minerals that ranged in price from about $0.30 per gram to over $8.00 per gram. That means you could be paying more than 25 times the price that you should be! Our top rated brands had to have high quality as well as affordability. Which Mineral Makeup Brand is best? In our research, a few rose to the top. And today we’re featuring Mineral Hygenics as one of the best of the best. Here are our ratings: Mineral Hygienics Mineral Makeup (Score based on their Foundation) Mineral Purity: A Talc and Bismuth Free: Yes Price: $1.60 per gram The Beauty Brains bottom line If you’re looking for a mineral makeup, this is a brand that we recommend based on our technical assessment.

"The Beauty Brains","","The best way to get shiny hair by The Beauty Brains Fungyi’s Fanatic About Hair Shine: Contrary to conditioners that simply use wetness to temporarily stick the cuticle scales together (similar to how a wet piece of paper can be stuck to a wall), I`ve read somewhere that there is something out there that actually glues cuticle scales close with a much stronger and permanent adhesive force. Would this be something like Redken Shades EQ, or a salon gloss? Thanks in advance for your consideration in answering this question. I love your site. Never has FRUSTRATION that comes from ambiguous, nonsensical and plain-weird marketing language (resulting in indecision!) been eradicated SO satisfyingly. I am on a mad quest to get the shiniest hair possible. You know those little locks of real human hair showing as samples for dye products? And you know how they are SO shiny, it`s as though they were coated with lacquer? Well, if I had my way, I`d have hair as shiny as that (don’t ask why). And if I REALLY had my way, I’d impregnate my hair with polyurethane under 100psi of pressure; that way, it would be shiny permanently! The Right Brain Rejects Redkin EQ: We wish we had some way to seal your hair in plastic too, Fungyi, but that technology hasn’t been invented yet. And unfortunately, wasting your money on special salon glosses won’t help much either. Basically they provide a temporary coating on your hair to help hold the cuticle down – any good conditioner or silicone serum will do the same thing. But you do raise a good question about what keeps your hair’s cuticles locked in place. It’s actually a natural glue-like chemical called 18-MEA that is sandwiched in between the layers of your cuticle cells. Daily wear and tear on your hair degrades the 18-MEA and makes your cuticles loosen and fall off. Look for an upcoming post on hair biology that explains that process in greater detail. But for now, keep using a good conditioner, don’t expose your hair to any coloring or straightening chemicals, and be gentle when combing and brushing.","The best way to get shiny hair","2cba67242e88da622f92759650c787f50460a5ea","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2007/01/the-best-way-to-get-shiny-hair/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Do I really need to put protein on my hair? by The Beauty Brains Doppleganger says : I’ve been told that hair needs protein and moisturization to stay healthy. So, for protein I use Mane n Tail and for moisturization I use hair cholesterol products (like Le Kair , Queen Helene ) and coconut oil. Is this good for my hair or can I be causing any kind of long term damage? The Left Brain Replies: Relax, Dop. These conditioners won`t damage your hair. You might find that your hair is weighed down if you`re using them all at once, but other than that they won`t do anything bad to your hair. So if you like the way these conditioners make your hair feel, then keep using them anyway you like. The real question here is, does hair really need protein and moisturization? The answer is yes and no. YES, hair needs moisturization That just means you need to keep your hair from drying out. That’s the whole idea behind conditioners. You can moisturize by adding water (which doesn’t really stay in your hair very long) or you can moisturize by fighting the effects of dryness. That’s what any good conditioner does. Conditioners, like Le Kair and Queen Helene, work by smoothing the outer layers of your hair, the part called the cuticle. Cuticles are like shingles on top of a roof. If you don’t keep them “glued down” they tend to come loose and fall off. When ever you’re doing anything to your hair (including washing, drying, styling, or coloring), your causing some degree of damage to those cuticles. What a good conditioner does is smooth the cuticles, forming a protective layer over them so they don’t become as damaged. NO, hair doesn’t need more protein Although, hair is made of protein, it’s dead. So putting protein on top of the protein in your hair doesn’t really make it “healthy.” But the right kind of proteins used at the right levels can act as a conditioning agent that can form a protective film on the hair. So it’s not that your hair needs protein, it’s that it needs SOMETHING to form that protective layer. Proteins will do it to some extent, but there are other ingredients (like fatty quaternium compounds or silicones, that will work even better. So protein conditioners like Mane ‘n Tail are good for your hair, but not necessarily BECAUSE they contain protein. We’ve written other posts about protein if you’d like to read more. The Beauty Brains Bottom line: There are many, many great hair conditioners on the market that will moisturize your hair. Mane n’ Tail, Le Kair, and Queen Helene won’t do anything bad to you. The important thing is to find the ones that feel right for your hair and that you can afford. But don’t worry too much about special ingredients like proteins. Oh, and by the way, the coconut oil you’re using has an added benefit. It penetrates through the cuticle to strengthen the inside side part of the hair called the cortex. But that’s a topic for another post like this one about the Ojon treatment.","Do I really need to put protein on my hair?","b6cab351a154632d2d1844520c8ef5031a10c420","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2007/05/do-i-really-need-to-put-protein-on-my-hair/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Emu oil: beneficial or bird brained? by The Beauty Brains Leah loves to learn: I recently purchased this reportedly “wonderful” Emu Oil on ebay and, whilst waiting for it to arrive, I am curious as to whether there is any scientific basis to back up the claims made about it. Apparently it’s amazing both in the fight against acne and as a moisturiser. To me, that sounds like a contradictory sentence. The Right Brain gives her the bird: Emu oil is made from the fat of the second largest bird in the world, Dromaius novaehollandiae , better known as the Australian emu. What’s the first largest bird, you ask? Who do you think we are, The Bird Brains?? Seriously though, the Australian aborigines have supposedly used emu oil for centuries for treating burns, cuts, and other wounds. Let’s take a closer look at this miracle bird oil. Good for skin Emu oil is primarily made up of unsaturated fatty acids (About 70%). The largest component is oleic acid (20%), an unsaturated fatty acid that naturally occurs in skin. It also contains a pretty good slug of linoleic acid (20%) and linolenic acid (1-2%) both of which are Essential Fatty Acids for skin. So, it makes sense that emu oil would be an effective treatment for dry skin. Furthermore, according to a 2003 research study , it’s an effective anti-inflammatory. (Interestingly, that same study also showed that fish oil, flaxseed oil, olive oil, and liquefied chicken fat had similar properties. But emu was the best of the bunch so if you’re offered the choice between emu oil and liquefied chicken fat, go for the emu.) Anxious about acne Leah also asked about the effect of emu oil acne. The answer to that question is a bit harder to sort out. A quick websearch revealed LOTS of references stating that emu oil is noncomedogenic (i.e., won’t clog pores and cause acne.) But most of these references were from companies selling emu oil or from other non-scienctific sources. The only bona fide scientific references we could find ( here and here ) state that oleic acid (the major component in emu oil) is VERY comedogenic. While it’s theoretically possible that other components in emu oil counteract the comedogenic effects of the oleic acid, we couldn’t confirm it one way or the other. So, we’re skeptical and we suggest that if you have acne prone skin you try it at your own risk. What about hair? Another of the Beauty Brains community, Rachel, asked how emu oil compares to coconut oil for penetrating hair. We weren’t able to find any test data to answer that question but there’s certainly no harm in trying it. So oil away, Rachel, and let us know how it works out for you. The Beauty Brains bottom line There’s enough scientific evidence to suggest that emu oil could be good for your skin, but if we’re not sure how it might affect acne.

"The Beauty Brains","","Beauty question: do aspirin masks work? by The Beauty Brains Ivy Asks About Aspirin: I’ve been preparing to write about Aspirin Masks. The mask is prepared by crushing four aspirins and mixing it with a bit of water to create a paste. Then it’s smeared over one’s face. Do you know anything about this do-it-yourself cosmetic? The Right Brain Responds: Aspirin masks seem to be all the rage these days, but we can’t find any evidence that they’re worth the effort. Here’s why: What is aspirin? The active ingredient in aspirin is the drug called Acetylsalicylic Acid. After you swallow an aspirin tablet it travels to your small intestine where this ingredient is broken down to create to Salicylic Acid. Salicylic Acid, or Sal Acid as it’s referred to, is the form of the drug that actually reduces pain, fever, etc. Now, Sal Acid also belongs to the class of chemicals known as Beta Hydroxy Acids, or BHAs. BHAs are similar to AHAs (Alpha Hydroxy Acids). Both BHAs and AHAs are known for their ability to help slough off dead skin cells when applied topically. Are you beginning to see the connection between aspirin and facial masks? Why aspirin isn’t good for your skin In theory, crushing aspirin tablets and rubbing them on your face COULD be beneficial because you’re delivering a skin smoothing BHA, right? Well, not exactly. You’re really delivering Acetylsalicylic Acid to the skin – NOT Salicylic Acid, which is the active BHA. And just rubbing the Acetyl verision on your skin won’t make it convert to the Sal Acid version. Ok, maybe SOME of the acid is present in the Sal version, but it certainly isn’t an optimized dose. The Beauty Brain’s Bottom Line: Putting crushed aspirin on your face might have SOME benefit, but if you really want a skin smoothing BHA treatment, just buy one of the many Sal Acid products on the market. In this case the home-made remedy doesn’t appear as effective as the chemist-made one.","Beauty question: do aspirin masks work?","1cff10c572b22a21ee3fc6997c27fee4bfcdc850","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2006/05/beauty-question-do-aspirin-masks-work/"
"The Beauty Brains","","For seriously tangled hair, don’t rely on homemade moisturizers by The Beauty Brains Jim’s Got A Problem: Here’s my problem. I’m an “older” male who has kept his long hair. Now that I’m left with only about 26,000 hairs!! it’s still long, curly … and once I spend 20 minutes in the shower with a ton of conditioner, looks great. My hair is SO tangly that virtually every hair I have tangles with every other hair. After gobs of conditioner and 20 minutes in the shower separating every hair from every other hair – 2 days later it’s a tangled mess again. I stopped using any shampoo or soap or anything (except conditioner) a long time ago. I’ve never coloured my hair or used any chemicals on it. So – what’s the most powerful, de-tangler you know of? I’d be prepared to use some spray on Teflon cookware product it that meant not having to slowly, slowly (from the bottom up naturally) separate every hair with tons of conditioner! Please help this super tangled guy! The Right Brain Responds: Jim, as always it’s a pleasure to hear from our male readers. We just wish there was more we could do to help you. What Makes Hair So Tangly? It’s possible that you have a medical condition that can cause hair to become excessively tangled. It’s called Uncombable Hair Syndrome and it occurs when your hair shaft is more triangular than cylindrical. Without examining your hair, it’s difficult to determine what your condition really is. Would A Homemade Moisturizer Help? Probably not, homemade products just aren’t that powerful. There are plenty of good conditioners that should be sufficient to detangle “normal” hair. Pantene is a great product because it combines fatty alcohols and silicones in a very slippery formula. If you haven’t tried that product, you might give it a shot. You might also try using a wide tooth pick in the shower to work the conditioner through your wet hair. Finally, you might also consider using a leave in conditioner in your hair at night to reducing tangling while you toss and turn in your sleep. You’ve probably heard some of this advice in the long hair forums, but we hope some of this info helps. Please write back and let The Beauty Brains know how this works out for you.","For seriously tangled hair, don’t rely on homemade moisturizers","aae1e07b9e3885605d4465fb01dbc0eab40bd0a5","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2007/01/for-seriously-tangled-hair-dont-rely-on-homemade-moisturizers/"

"Randy Schueller","","Why does Jergens lotion work? by Randy Schueller Gee Cee asks…. What makes this Jergens Natural Glow stuff work so well? It’s the first product that doesn’t make me look tanorexic. The Left Brain retorts: The folks at Kao (the makers of Jergens) came up with a pretty clever idea when they put this product together. No doubt sprung from a marathon brainstorming session with a massive group of cross functional team members. You can imagine the scene… Brainstorming Moderator : “Anybody have any ideas about new skin lotions? Anybody?” Marketing member: “We can make them more moisturizing” Moderator: “What a great idea! Let’s write that down on our flipcharts. Anyone else?” Marketing members: “How about vitamins?” Marketing member: “Proteins. Aloe, everyone loves aloe.” Moderator: “Those ideas are awesome.” Scientist member: “Have you considered dihydroxyacetone?” Moderator: “huh? Uh..thanks. Anyone else have any GOOD ideas?” Marketing member: “We could use olive oil” Moderator: “I love it!!” Isn’t brainstorming great. Someday we’ll be shot for revealing the inner workings of this business. But that day is not today. Today, we answer a question about a sunless tanning lotion. Jergens Natural Glow Ingredients A quick look at the ingredient list of the Jergens Natural Glow lotion illuminates the secret of how it works. The very last ingredient is our old friend Dihydroxyacetone or DHA. This ingredient, discovered in the 1920s, is responsible for the fake bake. Our first treatment of the subject can be found here . So why is this one different? Well, the amount of color you get from DHA is directly dependant on how much you put on the skin. Put on a lot, and your skin will resemble the Great Pumpkin. But put on a little bit and you get a highly desired light brown glow. In the Jegens product, they only put a little DHA in there so when you apply the moisturizing lotion, you only get a little more color. But if you put it on everyday you will get a steady increase in color. Traditional sunless tanners have lots of DHA in them so you get a really deep (and sometimes orange) color all at once. The other little trick that Jegens uses is a much higher quality DHA. The ingredient is obtained from either sugar beets or sugar cane and prior to the late 1980s, the quality was sketchy at best. But ingredient makers discovered ways to improve the refining process. This meant the DHA gave a less orange and more brown color. The Beauty Brains bottom line So that’s it. It works because it has low levels of high quality DHA that you use everyday. Now go out there and use your tan lotion to save face. Do YOU have any fave fake bakes?

Cindy’s sassy about Sebastian… What’s up with Sebastian Shaper Hairspray? Everyone I know who uses it just freaks out about this stuff but I can’t even find it because it’s always out of stock. Is there something really better or different about this hairspray compared to other brands? The Right Brain responds: Actually, Cindy, there is a simple answer to your question. Many hairsprays are formulated with a chemical that is TERRIBLE for your hair style. This chemical causes your hair to droop and lose its style almost the instant it is applied. Sebastian wisely chooses to NOT use this chemical in their aerosol hairspray and that’s one of the primary reasons their product is so good. Sebastian Shaper’s secret The secret to Sebastian’s formula is: WATER. That’s right. simple H20. Many companies use water in their aerosol hairsprays because it’s much cheaper. But when water contacts the hair, it loosens some of the internal bonds and causes the hair to lose its style. If you can avoid water in your hairspray you’ll get a much better style. (Of course there are other ingredients in the formula that control how well the hairspray holds. You can read our series on Adorable Aerosols if you want to learn more.)

They stated that it’s 100% Hydroquinone free, but I don’t know whether to believe it because they are in controversy right now for false advertising. What is your opinion on this? The Right Brain Says Hydroquinone Can Brighten Her Day: We’re not familiar with this Lumedia product or the problems at Bremenn Labs but we wouldn’t be surprised if these claims are a bit misleading. “Facial brightener” isn’t really a very well defined product benefit. Companies could argue that their product “brightens” skin simply by moisturizing and/or exfolliating. On the other hand, hydroquinone is very well defined: it’s an over the counter drug product used for skin whitening. Whitening and brightening are not necessarily the same thing, so don’t assume that a brightening product has to have hydroquinone.

"The Beauty Brains","","The hairy horror of hirsutism by The Beauty Brains This is the next chapter in The Beauty Brains ‘ Cosmetic Diseases and Disorder Series, which is intended to help our community understand conditions that can make it impossible for some people to enjoy the same beauty experiences that most of us take for granted. This chapter covers Hirsutism , which is what happens when hair starts growing in places it’s not supposed to. What is Hirsutism Hirsutism is the medical term for excess body or facial hair in women. If you`ve ever seen pictures of the legendary Bearded Ladies from the turn of the century circuses, then you have a good idea of what Hirsutism looks like. This condition occurs when hormones run amok, causing women to experience male hair growth patterns and it`s estimated that Hirsutism affects between 5% to 10% of all women. FYI, be careful not to confuse Hirsutism with Hypertrichosis. Hypertrichosis is a condition that causes excessive hair growth on normal parts of your body. For example, it`s normal for a man to have chest hair. But if a man`s chest looks like a bear skin rug, then he might be producing TOO much hair “ this is hypertrichosis. On the other hand, if a woman has hair in places she`s not supposed to, like on her chest (or in the case of the bearded lady mentioned above, on her face) then she has Hirsutism. What Causes Hirsutism It`s all about the balance of Androgens, a type of male hormone, in the female body. Specifically, Hirsutism can be caused by either an increase in production of testosterone and androstenedione, or an increased sensitivity of the skin to these hormones. In some cases, it may be a symptom of a more serious condition such as adrenal hyperplasia or ovarian tumors, particularly. If your hair growth patterns have changed dramatically, it couldn’t hurt to consult with your physician. What Are The Symptoms of Hirsutism Luckily, the symptoms are limited to the hair growth examples describe above. By itself, hirsutism is embarrassing but harmless. What Does Hirsutism Look Like Click the links below for examples of Hairs Gone Wild. Photo 1 Photo 2 Photo 3 How To Treat Hirsutism There are several effective ways to treat this condition. If hair growth is light, you may be able to just bleach the hair to make it less noticeable. (Hydrogen peroxide is commonly used for bleaching.) For more serious growth you can get rid of it by mechanical and chemical hair removal. (Depilatories and shaving are the most common methods.) You can also use temporary epilation which involves removing the hair at the root level. (Plucking, tweezing, and waxing are popular methods.) Finally, you can use permanent epilicaton method like electrolysis, thermolysis, or laser removal.","The hairy horror of hirsutism","ddb59f73a6570137f46883988466d6fd8f7b9fa6","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2007/04/the-hairy-horror-of-hirsutism-2/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Is too much exfoliation dangerous? by The Beauty Brains Kelly’s question: Hi! I recently read something about the “Hayflick Limit” – but in relation to exfoliating and using products like Retin-A that says you can only exfoliate a finite number of times and then your skin will stop reproducing new cells! Is this true? I’ve just started a regimen of AHAs and Retin-A and my skin looks gorgeous. Am I setting myself up for the “Hayflick Limit” if I use these products once a day? The Left Brain’s Limited Reply: The Hayflick limit determines the life span of some types of cells. When cells replicate they lose a little piece from the end of their DNA chain, which is called a telomere. Eventually the telomere becomes so short the cell can no longer reproduce. In a cell culture, normal human cells will divide 52 times before they reach their Hayflick limit. (For a more detailed discussion of the Hayflick limit and exfoliation, check out this thread from Smart Skin Care.) What does this have to do with exfoliation? Apparently not very much. When you exfoliate you’re stripping off the top, dead layers of your skin (the stratum corneum) which triggers the deeper basal layer to produce fresh cells. I couldn’t find any references that indicated that telomere shortening of the basal layer is a consequence of exfoliation. This sounds like another marketing scam to me, so be very wary of products like Dr. Tolonen’s Bio-Carnosin Beauty Cream, that claim to reduce the Hayflick limit through the use of Carnosine . Of course, there are other issues to worry about. Exfoliation can cause irritation, so you should still be careful how much skin you strip away.","Is too much exfoliation dangerous?","d335d39b7d79545402f0d3d561b2b82e55be95e3","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2007/12/is-too-much-exfoliation-dangerous/"

"The Beauty Brains","","What is a good facial sunscreen? by The Beauty Brains Anonymous asked this question in our post on sun tan addiction : Give us some advice about good sunscreen creams for the face! What are the best ingredients? Do avobenzone and oxybenzone protect as well as titanium oxide and zinc oxide? The Right Brain Replies : First of all, Anon, please remember that all UV is not created equal. There’s UVB (that mainly causes sunburn) and UVA that causes the deeper, more serious damage. Both types can be bad for all of your skin, but to protect your face from wrinkles you really need to worry about UVA. Only certain ingredients effecively block UVA – these include physical and chemical UV blockers. Physical UV blockers Finely powdered and dispersed minerals and include zinc oxide and titanium dioxide. To be precise, these physical blockers filter out both UVA and UVB. Chemical UVA blockers Includes avobenzone (a.k.a. Parsol 1789 or methoxydibenzoylmethane) and Mexoryl, a newer, seemingly more effective UVA blocker developed in Europe. Finally, there is Tinosorb, a good UVA+UVB chemical blocker approved for use in clothing but not on the skin. Both physical and chemical agents have pros and cons: Chemical sunscreens provide invisible coverage but they may not be very long lasting and they may be irritating to some people. The physical blockers last much longer and aren’t irritating, but they are more visible on your skin and they may even clog pores. (By the way, some of the newer, “micronized” physical blockers claim to offer better transparency.) They also don’t penetrate your skin so they may be easier to rub off. So which ingredient is best? There’s no single, perfect answer for everyone. But armed with the information we’ve just provided, you can make smarter choices about what kind of products to try and hopefully you’ll find one that’s right for you. Finally, remember that even the best sunscreens aren’t perfect: they don’t block ALL the UV, they can be easily rubbed or washed off, and they need to be reapplied. Don’t over do your sun exposure even when you do use sunscreens!","What is a good facial sunscreen?","88bc95fd873cdd3706d0a122c285192fc293a6cb","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2006/05/what-is-a-good-facial-sunscreen/"

Looking over the ingredients list, it looks like they did a good job of avoiding skin irritants (except for the tea tree oil), but since it all gets washed off after a few seconds, I don’t know how much good it could do.The ingredients are, Vegetable glycerin, lemon fruit water, sucrose cocoate, decyl polyglucose, willowbark extract, peppermint leaf extract (organic), willow leaf extract, burdock root extract, nettles leaf extract, yucca schidigera extract, cedar leaf oil, tea tree oil, lemon oil, rosemary oil, juniper oil, peppermint oil, xanthan gum (natural thickener), glucose & glucose oxidase & lactoperoxidase. The Left Brain Gets Indignant: You’ve discovered one of the shampoo scams that REALLY makes The Beauty Brains mad – false and misleading anti-dandruff claims. Some companies make it APPEAR that their products will control dandruff but they really won’t. The way companies do this may not be strictly illegal, but it certainly is unethical in my opinion. Let’s look at this Burt’s Bees product as an example. Burt’s Bees Feeling Flaky Shampoo According to Drugstore.com, the full name of the product is Burt’s Bees Doctor Burt’s Herbal Treatment Shampoo with Cedar Leaf & Juniper Oil . Doctor Burt, huh? I know that the reference is tongue-in-cheek, but that sure sounds medicinal to me! Strike One. Below the name it describes the shampoo as Feelin’ Flaky? with a question mark. In the context of cleaning hair and scalp, “flaky” is generally the term used to describe a symptom of dandruff. (Itchiness is another symptom.) Hmmm. Strike Two. And finally the use directions: Wet hair, lather, rinse, then lather and rinse again. Shampoo at least three times a week for maximum effectiveness.” Maximum effectiveness? Again, sounds like they`re promising some kind of sustained effect. If they`re not talking about dandruff, what effectiveness are they talking about? Just getting your hair clean. That`s lame – Strike 3! While this product, and others like it, don`t overtly claim to control dandruff, they are CERTAINLY making that implication. And that’s the same as lying to consumers. What’s In A Real Dandruff Shampoo The truth is, dandruff shampoos contain active ingredients that treat the physiological causes of dandruff. How can you tell if a shampoo is really effective against dandruff? In the US, look for active drug ingredients like Zinc Pyrithione (also known as ZPT.) In Europe and a few other countries, look for Octopyrox on the label. If you don’t see some kind of legitimate active ingredient listed it’s not really an effective dandruff shampoo. Don’t believe everything the cosmetic companies tell you! The Brains Bottom Line: You ask “how much good” this product will do for you. Well, it will certainly get your hair clean. The primary surfactants (sucrose cocoate and decyl polyglucose) will see to that. And it won’t dry your scalp out either, those are pretty mild cleansers. But that’s about it. It’s not a medicated shampoo so it won’t help against dandruff.","How to tell if a dandruff shampoo will really work","0ea40d2976f76bcc55d04385ca933168dc1b2cdd","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2007/01/how-to-tell-if-a-dandruff-shampoo-will-really-work/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Clarifying, chelating, and neutralizing shampoos by The Beauty Brains LeAnn’s wish for wisdom: What is the difference between clarifying, chelating, and neutralizing shampoos and how important are any of them to good hair health? The Right Brain supplies the goods: Good question, LeAnn, unfortunately the answer is not that simple. It depends on which clarifying, chelating, or neutralizing shampoos you’re talking about. That’s because all companies don’t follow the same definitions for their products. Some companies use these terms for marketing impact; they’re just a fancy way to say that the shampoo is cleaning your hair. Other companies have a scientific rationale for these terms and their shampoos are formulated to deliver different technical benefits. We’ll explain what these technical differences are so you know what to look for when you’re shopping for shampoo. Clarifying Shampoo What it is: This is the easy one: clarifying is just another way to say “deep cleansing.” The person pictured below needs a good clarifying shampoo. Stat! What to look for: There’s really nothing special about this type of product. Look for basic, cleansing system without any added conditioners. If you see things like Dimethicone, Polyquaternium-7 or Guar hydroxypropyltrimonium chloride, on the label, the formula will probably deposit conditioners on your hair that you don’t want if you’re trying to clarify. Examples: KMS Clarifying Shampoo Icon Energy Clarifying Shampoo Chelating Shampoo What it is: A chelating agent can chemically bind with minerals and keep them from depositing on your hair. At least that’s the theoretical basis for this kind of formula. We’ve never seen it demonstrated in practice. This type of product has most application to areas of the country where there is hard water. Soft water already has the minerals removed. What to look for: Look for products with the ingredient EDTA. Examples: Joico Kpak Clarify Chelating Shampoo Aveda Shampure Neutralizing shampoo What is it: True neutralizing shampoos are used in conjunction with hair relaxers. The high pH required by the relaxer to soften the bonds in the hair can be damaging to the scalp. So, after rinsing the relaxer out you’re supposed to wash with a low pH shampoo that neutralizes the high alkalinity. What to look for: Unless you’re relaxing your hair, it’s doubtful you’ll need a real neutralizing product. But if you do, look for one with a low pH (probably from citric acid.) Technically speaking, we should have added this one to our list of the 4 basic types of shampoo . (Even though I wrote that one, let’s blame that oversight on the Left Brain , shall we?)

"The Beauty Brains","","Beauty q&a: can I be addicted to eye drops? by The Beauty Brains Drop Addict asks… I read your post about being addicted to lip balm and I have a similar problem: I think I’m addicted to eye drops. My eyes constantly feel dry and I’m always putting drops in them. Is this bad for me? The Right Brain Responds: Dear Drop Addict, we’re not opthalmologists so we’re not qualified to give you any medical advice about your eyes (or any other part of your body for that matter.) But, since using eye drops to moisturize your eyes is kind of like using lotion to moisturize your skin, or conditioner to moisturize your hair – what the heck, let’s give it a shot. Dry eye It’s possible you have a condition called “Dry Eye.” If that’s the case, the answer isn’t putting drops in more often – it’s finding a drop that’s longer lasting. Plain saline drops have a very transitory moisturizing effect – they just don’t coat the eye very well. What you need are drops that contain ingredients known as hydrogels that increase the drops ability to stay on your eye. Common hydrogel ingredients include Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose, Carboxy Methylcellulose, Polyvinyl Alcohol, Carbopol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, polyethylene glycol, dextran, and hyaluronic acid. Look for drops with any of these ingredients and you should see some improvement. And by the way, here’s a GREAT reference for all things related to eye moisturization. Learn amazing things about real tears, find out what’s in artificial tears, and see almost 30 different kinds of moisturizing eye drops. Just reading the list of soothing drops made our eyes tired and dry! Finally, for a different kind of eye drop check out Eyegazms .

"The Beauty Brains","None","Why is Sebastian Shaper hairspray so freaking good? by The Beauty Brains Update: If you’re looking for a lower cost hairspray without water, try Tresemme Tres II Extra Firm Hold or L’Oreal Paris Advanced Hairstyle Lock It Bold Control. Cindy’s sassy about Sebastian… What’s up with Sebastian Shaper Hairspray? Everyone I know who uses it just freaks out about this stuff but I can’t even find it because it’s always out of stock. Is there something really better or different about this hairspray compared to other brands? The Right Brain responds: Actually, Cindy, there is a simple answer to your question. Many hairsprays are formulated with a chemical that is TERRIBLE for your hair style. This chemical causes your hair to droop and lose its style almost the instant it is applied. Sebastian wisely chooses to NOT use this chemical in their aerosol hairspray and that’s one of the primary reasons their product is so good. Sebastian Shaper’s secret The secret to Sebastian’s formula is: WATER. That’s right. simple H20. Many companies use water in their aerosol hairsprays because it’s much cheaper. But when water contacts the hair, it loosens some of the internal bonds and causes the hair to lose its style. If you can avoid water in your hairspray you’ll get a much better style. (Of course there are other ingredients in the formula that control how well the hairspray holds. You can read our series on Adorable Aerosols if you want to learn more.) Hairsprays that are “all wet” If you like the way Sebastian makes your hair feel, you’ll want to avoid these brands that formulate their hairsprays with water: Pantene Pro-V Texturize Suave Max Hold Herbal Essences Body Envy Volumizing Got 2b Styltini Garnier Fructis Style Volumizing Anti-Humidity Dove Hairspray, Extra Hold Rusk W8less Plus Shaping and Control Aussie Instant Freeze The best two holding polymers The other secret is to look for styling polymers that provide high humidity-resistant hold with flexibility. Many hairsprays use only one type or the other other. But the BEST hairspray used a combination. Look for these two ingredients on the label: VA/Crotonates/Vinyl Neodecanoate Copolymer Octylacrylamide/Acrylates/ Butylaminoethyl Methacrylate Copolymer The Beauty Brains bottom line Water is bad for your hairstyle but if you can’t afford Sebastian shop around for other hairsprays that don’t use water. How can you tell? Turn the can over and read the ingredient list! What’s YOUR favorite hairspray?

"The Beauty Brains","","How can henna condition hair? by The Beauty Brains Sandra’s Got A Hunch About Henna: Hi! I read your blog a lot, and it’s so interesting that I’m actually considering changing my major from Biology to Chemistry! Anyways. I want to grow out my hair to very long lengths, so I’m always looking for ways to take care of it. A lot of people at the Long Hair Community use henna and swear that it strengthens and conditions their hair. If I got it right from what I’ve read, henna coats the hair shaft, and even penetrates the hair to a certain extent, and binds to the protein of the hair, thus the strengthening. The coating effect smooths down the cuticle, so there you have the conditioning. So what`s the truth – Does henna condition hair? The Right Brain Coos About Chemistry: Sandra, we’re THRILLED to think our blog has helped you in in selecting your major. You’ll have to write back and let us know if decide on a career in chemistry. Speaking of careers, The Beauty Brains have been in the hair industry for many years and we have NEVER seen a single technical reference that ascribes hair strengthening or conditioning properties to henna. While we`re big fans of the Long Hair Community (we`ve quoted them on several occasions) this one sounds like the kind of thing someone just made up or heard from someone else. This much is true: the active ingredient in henna (called Lawsone ) does have an affinity for keratin protein (like your skin and hair.) That`s why henna is used to create mendhi, those decorative Indian skin designs. The brown stain sticks around for so long because it binds to your skin’s protein. But there`s no evidence that this interaction has any affect on the structure of your hair. Modern hair researchers have the ability to measure how well ingredients penetrate into hair AND how they impact hair`s tensile strength. Good conditioners need to be able to lubricate the hair shaft to smooth the cuticle and there`s no data to show that henna is efficacious in this regard. (Oh, and just in case you’re wondering, henna does do a good job of staining skin brown but it doesn’t really work well enough to help you quit getting grey hair .)","How can henna condition hair?","29e2a90befe0ec09852dd5502cd7cf18d5465354","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2007/01/how-can-henna-condition-hair/"
"Randy Schueller","","The hairy horror of hirsutism by Randy Schueller This is the next chapter in The Beauty Brains ‘ Cosmetic Diseases and Disorder Series, which is intended to help our community understand conditions that can make it impossible for some people to enjoy the same beauty experiences that most of us take for granted. This chapter covers Hirsutism , which is what happens when hair starts growing in places it`s not supposed to. What is Hirsutism Hirsutism is the medical term for excess body or facial hair in women. If you`ve ever seen pictures of the legendary Bearded Ladies from the turn of the century circuses, then you have a good idea of what Hirsutism looks like. This condition occurs when hormones run amok, causing women to experience male hair growth patterns and it`s estimated that Hirsutism affects between 5% to 10% of all women. FYI, be careful not to confuse Hirsutism with Hypertrichosis. Hypertrichosis is a condition that causes excessive hair growth on normal parts of your body. For example, it`s normal for a man to have chest hair. But if a man`s chest looks like a bear skin rug, then he might be producing TOO much hair “ this is hypertrichosis. On the other hand, if a woman has hair in places she`s not supposed to, like on her chest (or in the case of the bearded lady mentioned above, on her face) then she has Hirsutism. What Causes Hirsutism It`s all about the balance of Androgens, a type of male hormone, in the female body. Specifically, Hirsutism can be caused by either an increase in production of testosterone and androstenedione, or an increased sensitivity of the skin to these hormones. In some cases, it may be a symptom of a more serious condition such as adrenal hyperplasia or ovarian tumors, particularly. If your hair growth patterns have changed dramatically, it couldn’t hurt to consult with your physician. What Are The Symptoms of Hirsutism Luckily, the symptoms are limited to the hair growth examples describe above. By itself, hirsutism is embarrassing but harmless. What Does Hirsutism Look Like Click the links below for examples of Hairs Gone Wild. Photo 1 Photo 2 Photo 3 How To Treat Hirsutism There are several effective ways to treat this condition. If hair growth is light, you may be able to just bleach the hair to make it less noticeable. (Hydrogen peroxide is commonly used for bleaching.) For more serious growth you can get rid of it by mechanical and chemical hair removal. (Depilatories and shaving are the most common methods.) You can also use temporary epilation which involves removing the hair at the root level. (Plucking, tweezing, and waxing are popular methods.) Finally, you can use permanent epilicaton method like electrolysis, thermolysis, or laser removal. a href=http://carregwenimages.com/blond-shiny-hairy-male-arms-pictures' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>Blond shiny hairy male arms pictures July 19, 2011 at 9:46 pm { 88 comments… read them below or add one } andy April 24, 2007 at 7:12 am I can’t believe 5-10% of women have this problem. surely very mild in most cases Nina Cooke April 29, 2007 at 5:13 pm There is an interesting new product for hairy people who are tired of the relatively short-term effects of waxing, plucking, depilatories. It’s by Skin Doctors and is called HairNoMore. It’s a two-step system: first you use the cream to remove the hairs, and then you spray the area with a growth inhibitor which promises to slow down hair re-growth until it (eventually) permanently disappears. I know, the claims sound pretty outrageous, but it’s much cheaper than laser hair removal which can give patchy results. I wonder if the growth inhibitor spray is just as effective after other creams and other methods of hair removal. Luckily, it can be brought separately. Good luck it you decide to try it. If it works, it could be the answer to our hairy prayers. thebeautybrains April 29, 2007 at 8:34 pm It’s an interesting concept but if the growth inhibitor actually does work, it would be a drug because it interferes with the body’s natural metabolism. And you should be wary of using any drug that hasn’t been properly tested. And if it doesn’t work, you’re just wasting your money. tash June 15, 2007 at 12:17 pm im 17 and im pretty sure i have hirsutism. do you think taking the oral contraceptive levlen will hell cure it as i think the cause of my hirsutism is from to much androgens??? Jessie January 4, 2008 at 1:03 am I have been doing research for such a long time and have come to the conclusion that i will try anything to get this hair off my face, i saw that more caucasian women suffer form facial hair than any other, which is shocking to me becuae almost every african american i see have this problem, i wish i wasone of those that didnt. if anyone have any real and permanent solution please do me the honor of writing to my emial. i have tried electrolisis, lazer, tweezing, creams, shaving, shol growing agentd, even bleach creams. im desperae. RK July 13, 2008 at 4:50 pm I have a very mild problem and I started electrolysis a few months ago. The hair has definitely become finer and more sparse. I think it might be the best option available. teju August 2, 2008 at 5:00 am Hi, I m teju..from India. I’ve been suffering from mild hirsutism for 4 years. I have consulted doctor but he could not diagonise any malady.Everything, my ovaries, uterus, etc were all fine. But i am over weight, and my age is 21. What can i do to get rid of this. I’m desperate and suffer psychologically about this. I’m panic and sometimes i thought of suicide. I cannot afford more and cannot opt expensive laser treatments. So what can i do??????? teju August 2, 2008 at 5:04 am Please understand my feelings and can anybody help me regarding this??? This Hirsutism has created havoc in my life… My Boy friend has left me alone and i cold not concentrate on my studies and this prevents me from leading a healthy and happy life. I got frustrated and i can say ITS ONE OF THE WORST DISEASES THAT A wOMEN COULD SUFFER. IT MAY NOT HARM PHYSICALLY…BUT HURTS WOMAN”S FEELINGS PSYCHOLOGICALLY….PLEASE HELP…Immediately jess August 26, 2008 at 7:14 am I totally understand how you feel teju,the hair is becoming so much more noticable on my face now and im scared my boyfriend will leave me my whole life is ruined and compromised as a result of this disease Tanya September 21, 2008 at 8:36 am I’m 99% sure I have this or something very similar. I’m fair skinned with dark hair and if I do nothing, I have a beard. Thick, dark, and very noticable, mostly under my chin and such. I just go ahead and shave it off. There’s no shame in it just as there’s no shame in shaving your legs. Basic cosmetic procedure… only you have to do more of it. Doesn’t make you less of a woman or make you less sexy or anything. Hirsutism is a medical condition that happens. No one’s to blame and if anyone – friends or lovers – try to make you feel awful about it, well, they never deserved you to begin with. Lola October 8, 2008 at 3:18 pm Ladies, I fully understand your pain. I have been suffering in silence for 11+ years. I have one of the worst cases my doctors and electrologists have ever seen. My hair growth is on my face, neck, back, breasts, stomach, and is now showing up as excess hair on my arms and tops of my hands. It is my opinion that it is near impossible to get most doctors to take you seriously. Much less get them to refer you to an endocrinologist. They seem much more likely to shove medication at you such as glucocorticoids to treat the superficial symptoms instead of the underlying problem. I believe that since signs of hirsutism can begin to show up as early as 5th grade (as in my case) we need to start educating our young women about what to watch for as their bodies change. As I understand it, if most of the various causes of hirsutism are caught early enough, via an endocrinological work up, they have a greater chance of being treated successfully. As for the rest of us that have already descended into this lonely, black abyss of shame & secrecy, not to mention a lack of intimacy with our romantic partners; all we can do is band together. I think part of the problem is the isolation we all suffer from. We wonder if anyone else we know suffers from hirsutism but, we’re afraid to ask. Ladies, we need to start talking. I know how terrifying this sounds. But, if we don’t start talking about it to our friends, co-workers, daughters, sisters, mothers, doctors, etc., then we are simply maintaining the silence that has surrounded this issue from the beginning of time. As I’m sure we all know, the only way to rid anything of stigma is to take away it’s novelty. In other words the more we talk about it, the more women we’ll encounter who have it, the less we’ll feel alone and shameful, and ultimately through word of mouth, the more normal it will become. There’s power in numbers. And there is power in knowledge. So, let’s start a grass roots movement around the globe! If we can’t change our bodies, then lets start trying to change how the world views our condition. aisha November 22, 2008 at 7:18 am hi, ive just been doing some research and realised i hav hirutism i am now 28 sincei was about 10 ive had very hairy arms and legs, i started my periods at 9 still in yr 5 at primary school, started wearing a bra in yr 4 it wos bad at the time, even on very hot days i would keep my jumper on, and in PE when the teacher wud insist on us wearing shorts and no jumpers in summer, i would cry myself to sleep on a regular basis,i have suffered sooo much coz of this i hate it sooo much my face was next on te menu, i got very bushy eyebrows, a moustache, heavy sideburns, turing into a beard, i started bleacing my face and arms in high school, all my years of high school were terrible, i got picked on pple saying ugh when they saw my uncovered arms, my PE teacher saying she was so lucky she was blonde that no1 can see her hairs and that she felt sorry for us indian ple with dark hair and then i reached my gcse years, i hated summer, wud still keep on my jumper and stretched the sleeves so i could cover the hair on my hands and fingers, i was doing art for gcse, i had an evil boy who wud pik on me evry lesson “omg, ur a gorilla, have u never heard of nair or veet? u gorilla, ur arms are sooo hairy imagine what its like down thre? u must have a bush” because of him i went from a predicted A* to a rubbish B in art, i hated him sooo much i hated being in the sun, everyone wud see my bleeched long facial hair verrrry clearly. i noticed i was extremely hairy, when in class started wearing low cut tops etc and i saw i had a hairy back, hairy stomach, my breasts were covered in hair, dark long hair all over i had a bf who saw my breasts and stomach and was shocked at how hairy i was, arent u allowed to wax, i sed no. the most humiliating experience of my life, it was my mission in life to stay as covered as possible, no1 allowed to see my hair, i wanted to be invisible, this affected me in everything i only wore black hoping no one wud notice me. i had another bf then who sed the next time he meets me he wants to see all the hair on me gone, esp on my hands and fingers well, none of my relationships lasted more than a few wks then came marriage i was terrified, wot to do, where wud i hide made my mum bleach my whole front and back soooo embarrassing waxed arms and legs, bikini etc, after marriage 2 wk nhoneymoon, came home, hubby noticed dark spikey hairs on arms and asked wat is this? i told him i needed to wax again, but i had to wait till it all grew bk, then the bleach was wearing off, he was shocked, why are u soo hairy? ur hair on face is so long? ive never met a girl with hair sticking out of her nose etc etc, he left me at dads, made excuses etc, i knew it wos coz he didnt find me attractive anymore, already not even a mnth of marriage, i was sooo upset, went to gp, she sed she cudnt give me birth control pills coz i had a family history of blood clots, i went to the beauticians and got everything waxed, whole body, it killed, my face and eyebrows, breasts, stomach, back, butt, arms, legs, hands, fingers, feet, toes i went back to hubby he loved me again:-) now, i cnt afford to be waxed every 4 wks, and although my hairs are thinner they all still exist, and they are still black and visible, everywhere. i went to gp here and didnt tell them bout family histry of blood clots, they put me on yasmin the pill, i also suffered from terrible acne on my face and have horrible scars on sheeks and chin now, ive been on yasmin the pill for 1 wk, my hair on breasts is looking less visible, y skin is feeling softer, my facial acne is reducing my husband is saying tings like u look gorgeous as opposed to what he used to call me: cute anyways just thought id share experience, and now i think i mite have hirutism, im gonna go bk to doc and ask for moremeds specifically for this condition, hope it works thanks for reading lol, and sorry if i bored u to death Kristina December 2, 2008 at 10:26 pm I have hirutism. And of course I hate it. I wish I would wake up in the morning with smooth hairless skin, like when I was a little girl, but course that is a dream. I am from America and people stare at me everyday. I have a beard that is now connecting to my moustache, under my chin is covered, my breast and chest are covered and my stomach. I am a hairy girl from head to toe. Sometimes I feel like crap, but I have to remind myself that I cant control it, this is the way GOD wanted me, for whatever reason. I am tired of having to hide who I am just because society says that i am “abnormal”. I will be joyus when it’s okay to be hairy. When we have women who look like us looked upon as beautiful. I am married and my husband said he knew I had hair on my face the first day he met me and it wasnt a problem. I have lots of beautiful friends and they remind me that I am pretty too, especially because of my flaw. All the ladies that are hairy remember this, REAL WOMEN HAVE FUR!!! Hairy Lover December 26, 2008 at 2:14 am Hello, I love hairy women and would like to marry one. If any women here would like to chat with me, please email me at [email protected] Rose December 26, 2008 at 8:54 pm I just wanted to say how can u call this illness “harmless” ? It is not at all harmless to me it makes me horrible! No one who hasn’t this illness does not know how we feel, I always hide my self ! I never had a boyfriend because I hate myself ! Who wants to kiss someone hairy or make love? I don’t ….. How dare u to call it harmless I hate all the doctors who treat me like I would over react and think there is no problem with hair in my face . Of course it so not as important as heart surgery but it us impotant to me! To everyone who say’s that this is harmless : F..k you Delilah December 29, 2008 at 2:30 am I’ve been struggling with hirsutism 36 yrs and it doesn’t get any easier with time. My hirsutism is severe and seems to be getting worse with time. The stares, the talking behind your back when you’re 2 feet away and coworkers asking if you’re male or female, and the constant self criticsm is too difficult to even put into words. No one can fully express what a person goes through and feels on a daily basis due to PCOS. I’ve missed a lot because of this disease: dating, marriage, children, a normal existence. It would be nice to wake up in the morning and not have to have to pluck for 15 minutes and apply heavy makeup before setting foot out the door. It would be nice to wear fashionable clothes without worrying the clevage might be too low for hair to show. It would be nice not to constantly have to watch everything that goes into your mouth because you’ll easily gain weight. I can’t take the pill because it increases my bp. And every year, it seems to get worse. This is not living, this is hanging on and surviving. Taylor March 15, 2009 at 3:50 pm Im a 21 female. I think I’m in the early stages of this. I get random dark hair on my chin and neck, around nipples, and my bikini area seems to me absolutly untreatable. I cant wear a cute swimsuite because of so many red spots from trying to shave. Im going to ask my doctor if theres something wrong with me like ovarian tumors like it says in the article. This is such a sad condition. =/ Sonia May 1, 2009 at 6:11 pm Hi everyone I am 22 years old and I have been suffering from hirsutism since i was about 14. I have been to the doctor and had blood tests and scans to show that i have PCOS. I am now going to my GP to get medication which i believe will be contraceptive pills or maybe something else he suggests. I am sick and tired of the hair on my face, this is one of the worst diseases any woman can suffer from and no one would ever understand the pain it causes except by those that have it. I am really hoping that the drugs can stop the hair from growing even further and will also make the hair finer. I am generally a very confident person, but there are times when i become very insecure and paranoid as im sure you all have felt. Anyways i just want to say that there IS treatment out there, just go to your GP and tell he/she that you are suffering. You are not supposed to have hair on your face if you are a woman so dont sit in silence and suffer on your own. Do something about it like I am. I have a boyfriend who is very supporting of me and understands what i am going through- hes the one that actually took me to the doctors in the first place! Just remember women, you can have a great life still, dont let hirsutism win. reemie May 2, 2009 at 8:28 am All this time I thought i was alone. my heart goes out to everyone with this horrible condition. inner beauty is nothing to consider to ppl who see us and stare. believe it or not there is s god.I still beleive Renea May 9, 2009 at 1:23 am It is so sad to see that so many women suffer from this. I am a black woman and it is very hard to cover up the facial hair since it is black and and I am not very dark. I have tried shaving and using nair and things like that and it doesn’t completely take the hair away or make it invisible. It doesn’t matter how much makeup you put on, everyone can still see it. I have been keeping to myself more and don’t want to really date anyone because of this, I feel I can’t be accepted totally for who I am. You always feel like people focus on the hair when you are face to face with them and it is a horrible feeling. I tried laser hair removal before and didn’t get to get all of the treatments because they are so expensive but I am hoping to go back really soon to be done with this embarassing condition. Good luck and I wish everyone success with whatever method they try because I do feel your pain and even though some accept it and understand we can’t control it, it still makes you feel insecure and distant. Mel May 25, 2009 at 8:36 am I have hirsutism. hair everywhere from head 2 toe. I shave since I don’t have enough money to other treatment, now is getting worse I have to shave twice a day. More than men does i feel so bad I want to kill myself. thebeautybrains May 26, 2009 at 6:57 am We’re so sorry you have to go through this. If you can, see a doctor about the condition. Maybe she can recommend a better solution. raven May 31, 2009 at 12:53 am I’ve had a visible beard for 15 years. I admit, it was shocking to me at first. My doc diagnosed me with PCOD. At first I did everything to try to hide it. But after a year or so of feeling ashamed of myself, I realized that this was a good opportunity (albeit extremely challenging) to practice self-acceptance. I’ve been letting my beard grow ever since. Yes, I take a lot of crap for it. I’ve also learned a plethora of snappy comebacks for the ignorant and mean-spirited. One of the reasons I thought it was important to let it grow and show, as it were, was that I found a couple of friends who were in the same boat, and were also mortified. We decided to support each other, and to see if there were other women who we could be an example for. Our example being: women can be happy, sexy, brilliant, and bearded. Since I regained my self-confidence, I’ve had very little problem finding a date. Further, if your peers aren’t supportive, that’s just toxic— get the hell out and meet people that are supportive. As much crap as I’ve taken, I’ve had amazing experiences too; many times women will approach me and thank me, and tell me that they wished they had the courage to do the same. Once, a young woman at approached me at a festival I attend annually, and she told me that she’d noticed me for the last few years, and she wanted me to know that I was her hero. The hell with fascist beauty standards. This is your life to live without apology. afterglow_salon June 10, 2009 at 7:55 am Hey ladies! I am 25, and have tried everything to get rid of my hirsutism. waxing is the worst, especially under the chin, as my whole chin becomes inflamed and bumpy for at least a month afterward. The pill does work, it lessens the ammount and thickness of the growth. For those of us girls who have Pcos, I had had enough of all of the crap that comes along with this disease and have taken drastic measures. Two weeks ago I had a gastric bypass in hopes to loose excess weight, re-boot my biological clock, and get rid of this stupid hair growth. There are some medical research studies posted on the internet that conclude, gastric bypass helps over 80% of women with pcos and hirsutism. Mary June 14, 2009 at 7:14 pm I’m seventeen years old and I’ve been suffering with hirsutism since I was six. The hair is spread everywhere from upper lip to the base of my ankles and I’ve always felt so horribly monstrous and I still do. There’s just something so unnatural to me and it bothers me so much. I’m always pressured to take off my long sleeved jackets when it’s hot or in the summer, but I always decline and leave everything on. I’m always wishing it’ll stay winter for that reason and every time I wax or tweeze everywhere, the hair always comes back. It’s so hard for me to be or feel “natural” because of this genetic disease. The fact that it’s called a “disease” makes me feel even worse. I’m still underdeveloped and my period is abnormally irregular where I have it for a week very heavily then not have it for 4 or so months after, even though I’m not on any pills or anything. I weigh less than 130 lbs. and I wish I could show at least my arms and wear shorts without being looked at or talked about. Why does every girl or woman have to live up to bald expectations? It makes me feel so left out but I totally appreciate the fact that these brave women here aren’t afraid to speak out what’s been going on with them. To those who have mild and less severe hirsutism or feel uncomfortable with little hair: know that you are not alone and lucky you don’t suffer as much as some of us do. Lily July 6, 2009 at 1:08 pm I cried as I was reading these posts. For the first time in my life, I actually feel that other people understand what I’m going through. For those of you that can’t take the pill maybe you can take Spironalactone? My doctor just prescribed it to me so I don’t know how well it works, but anything’s worth a try. ps Raven you’re so brave, i wish there were more people like you. Mary July 21, 2009 at 2:13 am Lily, how is the Spironalactone working for you? I did some research and heard its main purpose is not for hirsutism, although it helps. One thing I found disconcerting is that there are quite a lot of side effects that don’t seem to be very great… Either way, I do hope life is working out at least a bit better for you now! Arleen July 26, 2009 at 4:33 am Reading this made me feel a little better, but not really. I hate having hirsutism. I’ve never had a boyfriend or really mingle with guys because of this. It makes me depressed and angry. I have thoughts of suicide more often these days. I don’t think I’ll be able to have a normal life or a relationship with a guy. Sometimes I don’t see the point in living. This tortures me everyday. I’m sick of plucking my chin everyday to appear normal. I have scars from plucking. I don’t really get rid of body hair except my legs and armpits. I just try to avoid looking at myself. I just want to feel normal…for once. ::Sigh:: Delilah July 28, 2009 at 6:03 pm Someone asked about makeup. After years of plucking, some women get dark skin around the area they pluck. I’ve found that using a cover stick followed by liquid foundation helps hide the hair that’s just below the skin but visible as well as hide the darker skin patches. To keep the makeup from caking or smuding, use a translucent powder. I used to get makeup all over papers, doors, clothes, etc. when I would touch my face and then touched something else. The powder solved the problem. glory August 6, 2009 at 5:49 pm I believe i have Hirsutism i have hair on my face neck chin breasts stomach legs my back my butt i can’t stand it i am 21 years old and haven’t been to the beach since i was 9. I don’t no how to swim never went in a date or had a boyfriend or even got close enough to a guy to let him touch me i hate it so much i have to cover myself always and forever Deena August 19, 2009 at 5:47 pm Ive had hirsutism since I was about 12 years old. Didnt have insurance during middle/high school so i never got a “diagnosis” until after college. Been treated for PCOS which means taking daily OC, 100 mg of spironolactone and 1000 mg of metformin. Been on this regimen for almost three years now and have seen only minimal improvement. I am a little overweight but not obese and have tried losing weight only to regain it just as quickly. I have noticed that when I regain the weight, the hair becomes darker and more of it grows. While my case is probably on the mild to mid scale, it still makes me feel uncomfortable especially in intimate moments. I generally wax my face – sideburns, chin and neck which are probably the worst about once per month as it makes me break out and have rash every time i do it. Ive tried nair and other depilatories but it only leaves my face burning and red/rash. I generally shave the hair on my stomach, but it grows back so quickly and so dark. I nair the hair on my lower back about once per month but it also grows back quickly and much thicker. I hate feeling like a freak. I cant allow myself to be in an intimate relationship for fear that the guy will comment on it and/or make me feel like I am less of a woman…which i generally do already. I havent been intimate with a guy in over 4 years (yes a long time!) and Im afraid Ill never be able to let myself get back on the horse. Ive met many wonderful and handsome men in the last few years, but something is always stopping me from getting too close – physically and emotionally. I dont talk about my “issue” with any of my girlfriends (Ive mentioned it to a few close friends) for fear that they will think I am abnormal. I dont know what to do. I dont really have the money to spend on electrolosis or laser removal. Im glad to know that there are others out there in my position and who feel the same. Its a very terrible and awful “disease” and I wish my doctor took it more seriously. I am considering revisiting the issue with my PC instead of going back to my OBGYN. I am going to directly tell her to refer me to an endocrinologist or other specialist. Something’s got to give, right? Its just unbearable to feel this awful all the time. Bobbi August 21, 2009 at 8:33 am I feel for all the women on this post. I have felt alone for so long. After being called Sasquatch throughout school I finally did something about it. Someone told me about Jolene Facial Cream Bleach. During my adolescence this really helped my self esteem (even though some people started calling me bush-wacker). I could finally start wearing short sleeve shirts, so I was happier, at least. I continued bleaching my facial hair, sometimes arm hair, and shaving my sideburns, and the hair on my hands and feet. But a couple of years ago I decided to confront my greatest fear and stopped bleaching and shaving all together. It was really tough, my self-esteem plummeted. I really felt like a freak of nature. But now that I’ve lived in this skin for a while, I rarely think about it. I know that “people talking about me, making fun of me” is mostly in my head, and reflects more on my self-esteem than other people. Besides, why do I want to please them anyway? And what really got to me was, what am I going to tell my daughter? To be ashamed of herself, that she has to change herself to really be somebody, to be worthy of respect and love? I couldn’t do that. It’s not to say that I don’t still have issues, I still pluck my sideburns to make them less thick and I still pluck the darkest hairs around my nipples. But there is love out there to be found. Do you really want to be with a guy who is hung up on looks anyway? You want a guy who will love you for you, no matter what the outside looks like. ANYONE could get in a car accident tomorrow and be completely deformed for life. Do you really want to be with someone who would leave you after that? Love is longterm, beauty is short. Angeles Godinez September 8, 2009 at 2:22 pm Hey:) Did you guys know that you can model your arm/body hair and get payed for it? I know, it sounds like a big lie right? Well I thought it was until I actually went to the site and noticed a lot of girls modeling their arm hair & they get payed for it. I say you guys try it. I’m currently an arm hair model on there and get payed once a month to show off natural beauty:) Shaving,waxing, laser treatments are a thing in the past; go to girlswithhairyarms.net and check it out:) Bobbi September 14, 2009 at 1:12 pm Wow! Thank you so much Angeles! I just took a quick look. I’m waiting for a banner or something to pop up to tell me this is a joke. I almost can’t believe my eyes! The media told me that there weren’t ANY women out there who looked like me. Thank you for showing me (and others) the truth. stubble85 October 6, 2009 at 3:12 pm I feel relieved and saddened that I have found other young ladies with this issue but am pretty fed up that none of you much like myself has found a cure all treatment for this. I have been suffering , yes suffering with the hairs on my chin and upper lip since age 15 . Between the hair and my overweight it is a constant struggle to find the beauty in me. At 24 I get really depressed about seeing all the fresh faced hairless beautiful girl prancing around NYC with flawless skin. I can’t afford as a graduate student to wax and shave and wax and all the other procedures very often so at times I just hide for the day. Please help. Delilah October 11, 2009 at 10:44 pm Some women could care less and aren’t afraid to show off their body hair. Others haven’t gotten to that point yet. During winter it’s easier not to shave and no one notices. Pants and long blouses are usually the norm. No one will notice you haven’t shaved. During the summer, I love to wear long dresses and that hides the hair on my legs. I shave when I feel it’s gotten to a certain length and no longer feel feminine. It’s such a chore to shave every day and who wants to do it. Facial hair you can bleach if it’s fine. But once you start plucking or shaving it off, it gets thicker and it’s hard to bleach it. Once you start tweezing, foundation helps to hide the hair. Once it becomes coarse that you can see the hair underneath the skin, then buy a cover stick, use foundation, and finish it off with transluscent powder. How long does it take to get ready? I would say 15 minutes to pluck my facial hair and about 5-7 minutes to do my makeup. It’s not that long. Some women take longer to get their hair done in the morning. It’s gotten to be routine with me as I do it every day for about 20+ yrs now and don’t think about it twice anymore. While on a tight budget, tweezeing, bleaching, trimming, and makeup will be the cheapest route to go. Oh, get yourself one of those 10X magnifying mirrors. You’ll be able to tweeze that chin in no time flat as it shows every little bit of dark hair. Magnifying mirrors are a GREAT investment and a good pair of tweezers. No one noticed my hair in college. I’ve been good at hiding it all these years and I’m now in my 40s. darkrider October 28, 2009 at 11:13 am hi evry one.. causes of hirsutism are polycystic ovarian syndrome, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, androgen adminstation, familial, meditrrn or asian bckgrnd, cushings syndrome. ur doctor may advice for random blood sample checking to know the levels of testosterone, lh, fsh and prolactin or overnight dexamethosone suppression test or acth stimulation test, ct and mri for adrenal tumours.. treatment depends on the cause… so, be sure you have been tested with the above tests which diagnose ur cause. antiandrogens and cosmetic measures are the mainstay of treatment. Lily October 30, 2009 at 11:30 am Mary, the Spironalactone is actually somewhat working. The hair is growing back finer, but there’s no reduction in the amount. A lot of these stories above sound like the story of my life. It’s so sad that we cannot do things that everyone else takes for granted. This condition has done more than just force me to cover up physically. I have also become a sad, introverted, bitter, mentally ill person. Younger girls reading this, try not to torture yourself like I have. You may not have control over your hirsiutism, but don’t let it take over your life. You are still human and have every right to exist. dunya November 1, 2009 at 1:50 am hey, im 20, and i used to have hirsutism. I started having this when i was 6 years ov age. I agree school was terrible, kids can be soo mean . last year my mom took me to do an IPL hairremoval on my face and neck. I couldnt do laser treatment because i hav olive skin and very dark hair. after 5 sessions, all of the hair disapeared!!!! I Then went into my GP and she gave me Estelle-35 ED. This contraception pill really works. I needed this to get rid ov the hair on my body. After a year of taking this medication, i have no hair on my body and my skin is very smooth and clear.:) Ladies, u are all beautiful!! Dont let this get in your way, give it a shot!!!! live your life and i wish this helps you leah November 25, 2009 at 7:39 pm i am about to turn 16 and i have noticed hair on my stomach getting darker after i shaved it a few time and i have sideburns but i bleach them, i also have hair around my nipples but i shave that everyday. i dont have that hairy of legs or arms. i have started to notice that some hairs on my face are getting longer and i was just wondering if i have the same thing as you guys? i have felt so loney and ugly and i feel so much better now knowing that im not the only one out there. i have a boyfriend and weve been together for about a year but i dont think he realizes it and im so scared that one day it will get worse and he will leave me, i dont know how to tell him and i really want this hair gone Carrie November 26, 2009 at 11:03 am Some body and facial hair is completely normal. Don’t let anyone else tell you otherwise. Treating this problem is painful and expensive. Don’t put yourself through it if it isn’t imapcting your quality of life. That said, I shelled out the money for laser hair removal on my upper lip, chin and neck and plan to get my chest and abdomen done. It cost $125 per session and I needed six sessions. It hurt! My skin was burned, swollen and bruised bad enough that I would only go for appointments on Fridays. My skin needed two days to recover so I wouldn’t look like a freak when I went back to work. After the six sessions I was completely hairless. I felt beautiful for the first time in my life. It’s been almost two years since then and the hair is starting to grow back. Lullah December 2, 2009 at 8:39 pm Hi, I have severe hirsutism. It has ruined my life completely. I am even worried about going to the doctors. Most doctors have never seen anyone like me. I have no sexual/intimate relationship. I’ve tried shaving, but it hasn’t worked that well (since I have coarse hair and big visible pores). Summer is the most embarrassing time for me. While everyone else can show off their skin, and feel feminine, and sexy. Not me. I’ve tried a little laser removal and it hasn’t worked as plan. Almost $500 down the drained. There is not one inch of my body with no hair. It is like a curse. I would really appreciate some suppport, I am suicidal at times. Pink December 4, 2009 at 3:33 am Hi girls, WOW i have been reading these comments for the past hour and I can not believe what I am reading. I think I have a mild case of hirsutism. I actually just learned what this word means (because I was looking it up for my medical terminology test). I never knew they had a word for this. I thought i was pretty hairy, but after reading these comments (and actually witnessing worst cases in my relatives) :[ I actually dont feel like i am over reacting. I hope i am not offending anybody, cuz i do not mean to. I guess i am now more accepting about it. In a way I feel better knowing that there are other women who go through the same problems i go through. All i can say is that this is life, an we need to get on with it. I know i dont live in your shoes, but y are some of u guys wasting you life feeling sorry for yourselves? START LIVING. One of the reasons I am saying this is because I am an Indian and I know what the mentality of most traditional indian women is. Growing up, i noticed that appearance has a big emphasis on indian women. I know I am slightly over weight, and i get a lot of crap from people (and the worst part is they are not even my family- they are other random indian people with these f*%@! old mentalities)! They make you feel uncomfortable in your own skin. Ladies, quite feeling sorry for yourselve and the situation you are in. Dont let someone else be the judge of your success and happiness. Break free from the norm and let yourself be known because your personality and character is what matters period. That is all that matters. As for being in relationships and marriage…I would never want to be in a relationship where I am not accepted for who and what I really am. If my partner can not accept the real me, then he does not deserve to be with me. Girls, the world is full of good and bad people. Ditch the bad and go find yourself a good man(or women) who accepts you for what you are inside, not outside. And dont forget… beauty is only skin deep. Good Luck Girls! Delilah December 14, 2009 at 1:50 am Once you find a doctor you like, stick with him/her. You’ll feel less self conscious and more at ease once you build a rapore with the doctor. Due to my ethnic backgrounds, the doctors would immediately say it was due to that but I knew something was wrong because as time would go on, I noticed I would get it in new places. I went to several gynecologists and endocrinologists who would run many tests and they all came back normal. It wasn’t until I was in my 30s that I had to have ovarian surgery and the doctor saw all these cysts that a diagnosis of PCOS was made. I did notice a pattern though, there would be a window of time where I would notice my hair really growing fast right before my period. Maybe what the doctors needed to do was do my blood work during that time. At any other time, I had normal hair growth. Modern medicine and technology have made strides in permanenent hair removal. If bleaching, tweezing, and shaving are no longer options, there are other ways to remove the hair. Talk it over with your doctor. There is the pill and other hormonal medication to stop new hair growth. Electrolysis is introducing electricity into the hair follicle and permanently killing the hair by the root. Laser hair removal also another option. I’ve had friends with extreme hair on their faces who said they needed 7 or more treatments before the hair was permanetly gone. There is also medication to help remove the hair. Most of these methods are somewhat expensive but I know of women who medicaid and insurance companies have paid for laser treatments because it’s not “cosmetic.” Cosmetic is getting rid of a couple of stray hairs. It’s not cosmetic when tests come back indicating PCOS and a woman has quite a bit offacial hair. Sorry, I’ve only heard of them paying for facial laser treatments not on other parts of thebody.A person previously posted she had laser and was hair free for two years and it started coming back. One thing we have to keep in mind is that women are different and what might work on one person might not work on another. Keep trying until you find something that works for you. If money is tight, then try the makeup, tweezing, shaving, bleaching option(s). Now about self esteem. One wonderful thing about the 21st century is computers. Look up PCOS and notice how many women are married or in relationships. Don’t do what I did and and pull back emotionally if I found some guy remotely liked me. What finally made me date was that I was feeling lonely and I was seeing people happily married with spouses who were blind, in wheelchairs,deaf, mute, you name it. I remember two brothers who were badly burned in a fire and there faces were badly scarred. Now they’re both married. Another friend has cerebral palsy and got married two years ago. They took a chance. It takes all kinds to make a world. Some are shallow and some are not. You’re pretty special and the man who asks you out is pretty special tooGive him a chance. And if it doesn’t work out, don’t say you’ll never date again. It just wasn’t meant to be between you two. News flash, hairless women get dumped all the time but they keep on trying to find their prince charming. I’m sure they had to kiss a lot of toads before they found their prince charming. bobbi December 15, 2009 at 12:00 pm Here’s a little tip for anyone searching for a new method of “hair removal”. This one feels a little more natural. See hairs have a life span, and some are ready to come out, they just happen to be sticking around. So I’ve started using a pomace stone (not too hard) and it seems to take some away, at least the ones that were waiting to go anyway. I use it on my face, and though it might be a little red for a couple of minutes, it quickly goes away, and it almost gives me the look I get after bleaching the hair. Sarah December 25, 2009 at 1:20 am iI’m so young and I am pretty sure I have hirsutism. I’m just barely starting the 6th grade and its tough. I started noticing the hairs in 5th grade, but back then they were just thin, short hairs. Now, their not so innocent. I’m getting hair everywhere. Every,single, place! Hirsutsm doesn’t cause medical harm, but it does cause emotional harm. It hurts to hide my face. I don’t talk that much anymore. I’m just the girl that sits with her flawless friends and doesn’t say a thing! I tell my parents about hirsutism and they laugh at me. I’m crying just writing this. They say we should be proud, or we can’t help it, or that GOD made us that way. But I can’t look a single person straight in the eye, how am I supposed to be proud? Right now the hair is growing even more. So until I find help, I’ll cry in the dark just like I have been. Britt December 29, 2009 at 3:41 am Sarah- I know its hard. I am 22 and I think I have hirsutism too. But I just wanted to tell you that alot of times parents just can’t see that you are really hurting.. If I could go back to when I was a teen and I was going through depession.. I would just cry and tell my mom that it IS serious, and my feelings ARE real.. and if they cared ANYTHING about me.. to get me some help. They just don’t understand.. But don’t let that make you feel like you’re feelings aren’t real. Just talk to them again… do some research on it. And make them take you to the doctor. Remember, you are not the only one going through this If I could take away your pain, I would. There is still hope. Sending my love, Brittany Amy Wallace January 1, 2010 at 9:07 pm Guess what! My hirsutism went away completely with age: but in the meantime, I had a few boyfriends who appreciated it — one who LOVED and ADORED it, and cried over the permanent hair removal I’d had done before I met him. There are such guys out there, BELIEVE ME! Jonni January 4, 2010 at 2:00 pm Hi, I have had excess hair since i was about 11 or 12. I have it on my chest breast, neck, and majority on my abdomen. I’m 18 right now. I’ve never told anyone, it makes me very self conscious and i was wondering if I should seek medical attention. I have anxiety issues and get upset very easily when put into awkward situations. I do not think my doctor would understand and would rather go to a specialist. what kind of doctor should I see? bobbi January 6, 2010 at 8:44 am Jonni, I felt the same way when I was younger. I’ve gone to see an Endocronologist. They put me on a medication (can’t remember the name now), and my regular doctor had put me on the pill as well. The hormones in it is supposed to stop or at least slow down the growth. I’ve also gone to see another specialist who told me that it was just my genetics, that my ancestors were probably from the mediteranean area, and that it was normal. Media tells us that it’s not, but hopefully you can read the other posts here, and go to the arm-hair modeling site to see that it is much more common than we are all led to believe. The media also tells us that everyone should be thin, but if you look around when going to a mall, 80% of the people are NOT thin. So, who’s to say that they are correct on the whole hairless thing? I have hair on all the same places as you, plus more. I have felt unworthy for most of my life. Finding a life partner who accepts me for who I am, inside and out, has definitely helped me to realize that looks are temporary, anyone could get into an accident or get burned tomorrow. When looking for someone to spend the rest of your life with, there are MANY more things to consider besides looks. We are all here to support you, whatever decision you make.","The hairy horror of hirsutism","c0c0bf14fe51205b926e0e15ae21edb4a75ef3db","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2007/04/the-hairy-horror-of-hirsutism/"
"Randy Schueller","","7 sure ways to straighten your hair by Randy Schueller Straight hair is in. And people with curly or wavy hair will pull, blow, iron, treat or do practically anything else to get straight hair. That can’t be good for your hair health, right? Some treatments aren’t even good for your personal health as Del over at Are You A Beauty recently reported in her piece about the Brazilian hair straightening system. We here at the Beauty Brains thought it would be helpful for you to know the 7 most common ways to straighten your hair and the pros and cons of each. Seven Ways to Straight Hair 1. Hairdressings & Silicone Creams . This is a classic hair product based on oily materials like petrolatum, mineral oil, and lanolin. Silicone creams work the same way but contain materials like dimethicone or cyclomethicone. Apply the product all over your damp hair and comb straight. The oils coat your hairs preventing them from curling up when they dry. The most famous of these types of products is VO5 Hairdressing . Evaluation : Incredibly effective on all types of hair. Non-damaging and relatively inexpensive. The downside is that your hair will feel greasy, get dirtier faster, and can look weighed down. The effect will last until you wash out the product. 2. Brushing and blow drying. As hair dries, it tends to curl up. This is a direct result of the water content and the chemical bonds existing in the hair fiber proteins. If you can hold your hair straight with a comb and blow dry it, it will hold that position. It’s a bit like using an iron to straighten the wrinkles in clothes. Evaluation : This method is simple, moderately effective but depends heavily on the skill of the person doing it. It’s much easier for a stylist to do than for you to do it on your own hair. It is slightly damaging, will not work on extremely curly hair, and frizzes out in humid weather. It will leave your hair feeling more natural than hairdressings or styling products. So, if you don’t want to spend much money, get a good hair dryer and trying combing out those curls. It may take some time but it should work. 3. Flat Iron . If you have really curly hair and the blow-drying + combing method doesn’t work, try using a flat iron. After washing your hair, you comb it and use a flat iron to get it dry and straight. It uses the same principle to get your hair straight but it is more intense and effective on nearly all hair types. Here’s a short video showing how to straighten hair with a flat iron . Evaluation : Flat irons will work with almost any hair type. If you know what you’re doing it can be done relatively quickly. Unfortunately, it is more damaging to your hair than a blow dryer and will frizz out when humidity is high. Once you’ve bought your flat iron it’s a relatively inexpensive way to get a straight hair style. 4. Styling products . If you don’t like the greasy feeling of hairdressings and don’t want to take the time required for flat ironing, then styling product straightening might be for you. These products coat the hair with polymers that rigidly hold the hair straight. Things like hairsprays, gels, mousses, and putties can all be used. Evaluation : Styling products are effective but require some skill in applying and shaping your hair. They will hold the hair straight better than the blow drying or flat iron methods. The effect will last only until the products are washed out. The primary downside is that your hair may not look and feel natural. 5. Brazilian Hair straightening . This method is the hottest new hair styling treatment in salons. It even made it into a story in the New York Times . Your stylist applies a keratin protein formula and uses a flat iron to get your hair straight. Theoretically, the protein will crystalize on your hair and keep it in a straightened state. You are then encouraged not to wash your hair as frequently because you’ll reverse the effect. Evaluation : This procedure works but at $150 it hardly seems worth it. If you wash your hair a few times the protein will come right off and your hair will return to it’s natural, curly state. There’s also the issue of a significant amount of Formaldehyde being included in the formula. It shouldn’t be a problem for you but I certainly wouldn’t want to be the stylist who gets exposed many times a day. This procedure works but you can get the same effect using a flat iron, styling products and less frequent hair washing. 6. Japanese straightening system . This is a more permanent way to remove the curls from your hair. At >$500 per treatment, it is the most expensive of all the methods outlined here. For the Japanese straightening system the stylist applies a special formula all over the hair. Then they use a flat iron and neutralizing solution to get the hair straight. With proper care the effect should last for 6 months. Evaluation : The high price of this procedure has kept most people away from repeat procedures. While we haven’t been able to see the exact formula the description of how it’s applied sounds suspiciously like a hair relaxer. The fact that a neutralizing solution has to be used suggests a bond-breaking, chemical reaction. Kudos to the inventor for convincing people to spend that much money on a less harsh version of a hair relaxer. This procedure will permanently get rid of those curls but it’s expensive and incredibly damaging to your hair. 7. Relaxer . If you want straight hair there is no more effective method than getting your hair relaxed. In this procedure a caustic chemical is applied to your hair and a chemical reaction occurs. The hair is then physically straightened and a neutralizing formula is used to reform the chemical bonds in the new straight shape. You can even do this to your own hair at home using a product like Affirm relaxer . Careful because the chemicals in these formulas can be dangerous. Evaluation : There’s no doubt about it that this method will permanently take the curls out of your hair. It will also be more effective and cheaper than either the Brazilian or the Japanese systems. However, it will also be the most damaging treatment you can do to your hair. Your hair will break more easily and will feel dry. Eventually, your curly hair will grow back so you’ll need to continue to relax hair if you want it straight. We get so many questions here at the Beauty Brains demonstrating that everyone wants what they don’t have. People with straight hair want curly hair, those with curly hair want it straight. Fortunately, clever cosmetic chemists have come up with ways to give people whatever they want. Do you want to learn more about which beauty gadgets REALLY work?

"The Beauty Brains","","New acne drug makes skin 70% less oily by The Beauty Brains Who wants to dry up oily skin? According to Science Daily, a new drug has been shown to reduce excess sebum secretion by 70%. And since sebum is one of the contributing factors to acne, this could lead to new improved acne treatment. The bad news is, the drug is still in testing so it isn’t on the market yet.

"The Beauty Brains","","How do pore strips work and are they worth it? by The Beauty Brains Anonymous Asks: What can you tell us about Biore-type pore strips? It’s strangely fascinating seeing all the crap come off on the strips, but is just a quick-fix that will actually make things worse in the long run? The Right Brain Boasts About Biore: A pore strip, like Biore’s, is a very dramatic way to clean your pores. It works by adhering tightly to your skin so tightly that when you pull it off it also pulls out the oily, dirty gunk that is clogging your pores. Pore strips really work The cool thing is that you can actually SEE the pore poop stuck to the strip after you take it off. The first time the Beauty Brains tried this product they sat staring transfixed at the forest of tiny nasal pore discharges dotting the landscape of the freshly spent pore strip. Some white heads were barely visible to the naked eye; other black heads where ominously thick and dark. We still get shivers just thinking about it. Even if you don’t feel you need them, we recommend trying pore strips as an experiment just so you can see for yourself. The problem with pore strips When used correctly, Pore Strips can be a powerful weapon in your battle against blackheads. But don’t use them too often because they can irritate your skin. Three times per week max, that’s the limit. Any more than that and you risk damaging your skin. You should heed the warnings on the box about not using them on any area other than the nose and not to use them over inflamed, swollen, sunburned, or excessively dry skin. If you use pore strips too often, they can actually irritate your skin and trigger more breakouts. The Beauty Brain’s Bottom Line: Pore strips really work, but they’re no substitute for a good, regular cleansing regimen. And don’t use them too often or you may experience some negative side effects.","How do pore strips work and are they worth it?","d19f18f68abae2348e67d0ec37ca6ec41e3de72c","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2006/05/how-do-pore-strips-work-and-are-they-worth-it/"
"The Beauty Brains","","The truth about silk and cashmere proteins by The Beauty Brains Laura`s Questions: Question 1: Products such as Softsoap’s Pure Cashmere line claim to contain a cashmere extract, taken from protein in goat hair oil. Does this sound plausible? Answers From The Right Brain: Yes, it’s plausible. Protein is a natural ingredient derived from animals (from skin, hooves, horns, and hair) and from vegetables. Cashmere extract belongs to the class of proteins extracted from animal hair; goat hair to be precise. In fact, goats have two layers of hair and the softer, inner hair is what we know as cashmere. The technical name for this ingredient is hydrolyzed keratin (sometimes called hydrolyzed wool. I’ll explain what hydrolyzed means in a minute.) Question 2: Some products contain hydrolyzed silk protein. Is this product common in hair products? Answer: Yes, many cosmetic products use silk protein as a featured ingredient. And silk protein, as the name implies, is extracted from silk. As in silk worm cocoons. Or spider’s silk. Question 3: What benefits would the cashmere extract likely have? Would it prevent moisture loss? Soften skin? Would this cashmere be considered an oil? Question 4: What specifically does silk protein do? (I’ve read it temporarily fills cracks in the hair shaft, but I’m not sure what this means.) Would this silk protein have a sealing effect on dry skin? If so, how and why? Answers: Here’s where it gets tricky. In theory, proteins can help moisturize skin and smooth hair because hair and skin are also made of protein and because proteins are large molecules that are able to form films. By forming a film they can retard moisture loss, much like the skin that forms on pudding. However, in practice, proteins are not very effective moisturizing ingredients. That’s because in their native form, they are very large molecules and they are not easy to incorporate into body washes or shampoos. So, the chemical companies that sell proteins have to break them down into smaller units that are more water soluble and therefore easier to work with. This process of breaking big proteins into smaller pieces is called “hydrolysis.” The good news is hydrolyzed proteins are easier to put into formulas. The bad news is, they aren’t very effective because making the molecules smaller causes them to lose much of their film forming properties. Another reason that proteins aren’t very effective is that they won’t stick to hair very well from a rinse out product (like a shampoo or a body wash.) There are special proteins (called quaternized proteins) that are chemically modified so they’ll stick to hair and skin better. Does all this mean that Softsoap and other products that use proteins don’t really moisturize hair and skin? No, not at all. It just means that the proteins are not really the functional ingredients doing the moisturizing. That’s a common game that the cosmetic industry plays. Manufacturers try to differentiate their products with “sexy” sounding ingredients. In reality, it’s usually the formula as a whole, and not any specific ingredient, that’s getting the job done.","The truth about silk and cashmere proteins","61f172047d3d7a18a9f4d880a709e22d8035c9c0","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2007/01/the-truth-about-silk-and-cashmere-proteins/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Does the pink patch weight loss patch really work? by The Beauty Brains Shelley is shocked: Wow! I was on Facebook today and saw an advertisement for this amazing little patch that’s supposed to make you lose weight and prevent ovarian cancer all at once! I found these claims dubious at best, but it would be great if you all could work your magic and let me know if there’s even a sliver of truth to them. I found it interesting that they would advertise on a site where lots of impressionable high school and college age girls with body image issues are likely to be active. The Left Brain is perturbed about Pink Patch: Frankly, Shelley, I think Pink Patch is trying to exploit young women based on their self image and I find that appalling. Given their dubious claims about weight loss, mood elevation, and breast/ovarian cancer prevention, it’s surprising the FDA hasn’t shut them down already. Active ingredients used in the Pink Patch The Pink Patch website list several key active ingredients. Including 5-HTP, Fucus Versiculosus (a type of seaweed), yerba mate, and lecithin. Claims from the Pink Patch website A natural mood enhancer and also helps curb your appetite. A natural mood enhancer and also helps curb your appetite. It reduces excess weight, increases your metabolism and energy – so you can forget about those pesky five pounds! Aids your body’s breakdown of fats and cholesterol, it helps distribute body weight — no more disproportion! It boosts your immune system, is good for your heart, and lowers your cholesterol. All of these benefits dramatically increase your body’s ability to loose excess weight. According to the United States National Institute of Health, Fucus Vesiculosus can lower the risk of breast and ovarian cancers and cholesterol. For example, women in Japan are 30% less likely to develop breast and ovarian cancer than women in North America – due to the amount of seaweed, including Fucus Vesiculosus, consumed in their diet. The Truth about The Pink Patch The Pink Patch’s approach is to pick and choose bits of information about various ingredients and slap them together to entice young girls into trying their product. 5-HTP for example, has been studied clinically and does have some evidence it can help with mood elevation. But studies showing a link to weight loss are mixed. And The Pink Patch conveniently fails to mention side effects, like nausea. But perhaps most importantly, all the studies cited in the literature were based on relatively high dosages (100 to 300 mg per day). The Pink Patch gives no information on the dosage of their ingredients so it’s impossible to tell if they are using very low and ineffective levels, or very high and potentially dangerous levels. For more information read this review of 5-HTP from Vanderbilt University. Similarly, The Pink Patch exaggerates claims related to Fucus Vesiculosus and weight loss. To claim that the use of their patch containing this sea weed derivative can have the same effect as a long term diet rich in this material without the research to back it up, is unfounded and misleading. But don’t take our word for it, the US Federal Trade commission filed suit against similar weight loss patches that make claims based on sea kelp. I urge you to read the FTC report on weight loss patches . The Beauty Brains bottom line As usual, if something sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Without specific, long term clinical studies showing that this patch is effective, I have absolutely no faith in any of the claims made by this product and would strongly urge anyone to reject it. Please pass the word to anyone considering using this product. This probably won’t work. Have you tried The Pink Patch or any other crazy weight loss schemes? Don’t be embarrassed – share what’s worked (or not worked) for you so the rest of the Beauty Brains community can learn. Share anything, even if it’s body wraps .","Does the pink patch weight loss patch really work?","aef8fdeccbe7142cf268dc56685105845e63ca90","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2008/03/does-the-pink-patch-weight-loss-patch-really-work/"
"The Beauty Brains","None","Is mixed chicks leave-in conditioner good for curly hair? by The Beauty Brains Gina just wants to know… I’ve been reading rave reviews of this Mixed Chicks product. Can you tell me how it’s different from Cantu Shea Butter, the leave in I use now? The Right Brain replies: For those of you not familiar with Mixed Chicks, it’s a line of hair care products designed for hair of biracial origin. Their website explains that the line is a “curl-defining system designed for “us” whether you’re black, white, asian, latin, mediterranean, or any glorious combination of the above.” The Leave-in you asked about is described as a “patented formula penetrates the hair shaft, conditioning as it smoothes the follicle.” I hate to be nit-picky on this point, but the follicle is the tiny tube beneath your scalp that the hair grows from. You can’t “smooth” the follicle but you can smooth the cuticle which is the shingle-like outer most layer of hair. We don’t expect Mixed Chicks to be scientific experts but they should understand basic hair biology so they can explain how their products really work. Mixed Chicks Leave in Conditioner Ingredients How does Mixed Chicks compare to Cantu? Let’s take a look at the ingredients for these two products. First the Mixed Chicks leave in and then Cantu. To make it easier to read, we’re leaving out preservatives, colors and fragrance: Water, Glycerin, Amodimethicone, Emulsifying Wax, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein/pvp Crosspolymer, Stearalkonium Chloride, Methylguceth-20, Hydroxypopul Timonium Chloride, Hydroxyethyl Cellulose, Jojoba Oil, Safflower Oil, Primrose Oil, Wheat Amino Acid, Crosilk, Hydrolyzed Collagen (Marine) (Note: this ingredient list came from Amazon.com and has several typos.) Water, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Glycine Soja Oil (Soybean), Propylene Glycol, Polyquaternium 37, Propylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, PPG 1 Trideceth 6, Cetyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Stearalkonium Chloride, Trimethylsilylamodimethicone, Panthenol, PPG 1 PEG 9 Lauryl Glycol Ether, Lanolin Oil, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Acrylamidopropyltrimonium Chloride/Acrylamide Copolymer, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein Both are mixtures of water with oils and conditioning polymers. The big difference is that Cantu is based on shea butter and soybean oil while Mixed Chicks is high in glycerin and amodimethicone. Amodimethicone is an excellent conditioner and is one of the primary ingredients in Infusium 23, one of the classic leave in conditioners. Both products should provide a high level of conditioning. We’d expect that Mixed Chicks would provide less greasy curl definition based on the lower concentration of oily materials. The Beauty Brains bottom line Both Mixed Chicks and Cantu appear to be highly moisturizing leave in conditioners but it’s impossible for us to say which one is better for you without knowing your hair type. If you decide to try both, write back and let us know which one you liked best! Does anyone in the Beauty Brains community have any curly conditioning tips for Gina?

"The Beauty Brains","","Does dove visibly smooth deodorant reduce underarm hair? by The Beauty Brains Vananners asks… What do the Beauty Brains think about the new Dove Visibly Smooth Deodorant that supposed to minimize hair growth? I’ve been using it about 3 weeks now and feel like I’ve noticed a difference. The hair seems to grow slower, is softer and easier to shave. The Left Brain replies: As I pointed out in the Forum , hair growth minimizers are more marketing than anything else. If the product actually worked to slow down hair growth then it would be considered a drug and require much more extensive testing. In fact, if you check the claims that Dove’s website makes about Visibly Smooth, you’ll see that they do NOT claim that it does reduces hair growth. Dove Visibly Smooth claims Conditions your underarm skin from the first time you use it Minimizes the visible appearance of underarm hair over time Within weeks you’ll notice hair feels softer, finer and easier to remove Hair should be less noticeable between shaves and you may need to shave less often. Hair growth is not slowed down How does ProEpil Complex work? The “reason to believe” ingredient in Visibly Smooth is Dove’s “ProEpil complex.” According to the website, the complex is a mixture of ingredients including sunflower oil and Dove’s “1/4 translucent moisturizers” what ever that means. It sounds like these conditioners make the hair softer and less likely to “stick up” so razor stubble is less noticeable. The Beauty Brains bottom line Dove Visibly Smooth doesn’t claim to reduce hair growth, it only claims to make underarm hair look and feel less noticeable. How does the product accomplish this? None of the information from Dove makes this perfectly clear, but it appears to be by conditioning underarm hair. Still, it’s not surprising that you think you notice a difference after using the product. Marketing messages are extremely powerful persuaders. Do YOU worry about underarm stubble?

"The Beauty Brains","","What you should know about head lice and hair color by The Beauty Brains Fawn’s Fervent About Head Lice: I was wondering if it is safe to put commercial lice treatment shampoos, Rid or Licex , on newly dyed hair. How long should you wait after treatment to dye your hair? Also, does the dye provide any lice protection? The Left Brain Is Picky About Nits: Thanks for your questions, Fawn. Hopefully these answers will help: 1) Without going into a lot of hair dye history , let’s just say that you should avoid using ANY shampoo on freshly dyed hair. That’s because the washing process removes a lot of dye. If you can, wait at least a couple of days before you shampoo. 2) You can have your hair dyed the next day after lice treatment. The active ingredients will essentially be washed away when you shampoo again. And even if a little is left behind, that shouldn’t interfere with the dying process. 3) While the dye itself won’t keep lice away AFTER you color, if there are any on your hair during the coloring process the high pH should scare the little buggers away.

"The Beauty Brains","","Beauty Science or BS Answer: Backne can Strike Anyone by The Beauty Brains Hello budding Beauty Brains , it appears this beauty science week’s poll was a bit tougher than last week’s . Only 31% of you correctly revealed that the story about blemishes on your back was bogus. The more common answer chosen by 32% of you was the real story about strippers on birth control earning less money. Read on to see the complete explanations. And come back on Monday for an all-new Beauty Science or BS challenge. 1. PETA kills thousands of animals each year – TRUE. 22% couldn’t believe this is true but it is. They believe that it is more humane and economical to euthanize unwanted animals than try to house and support them until their natural deaths. While it’s a practical solution, it seems a bit discordant with their philosophy of treating animals humanely. 2. People with facial acne are more likely to get back acne – FALSE. 31% of you picked this scab and you were right. Backne is indiscriminate and will affect people whether they have facial acne or not. 3. Strippers taking birth control pills earn less money – TRUE. 32% of you thought this as fake as a silicone enhanced bust line, but you were mistaken. The research, published in the journal Evolution and Human Behavior , endeavored to determine whether women earn more money during their fertile phase. They studied 18 lap dancers in strip clubs and found that they actually did make more money when they were more fertile. They also found that women taking birth control made less money than those who weren’t. Researchers speculate women behave in subtly different ways that men can unconsciously pick up on. Why this causes them to part with more money is unknown. 4. Temporary black henna dyes can cause permanent scarring – TRUE. Only 15% of you thought this was fake but it’s real. Black henna contains a compound called Para-phenylenediamine (PPD) to which some are allergic. When exposed, their skin will start blistering which can lead to scarring. The FDA does not allow black henna to be used as a skin colorant because of this problem. Note: black henna is not the same as natural henna which is typically brown or reddish brown. So, did you get it right? Leave a comment below and let everyone know. And be sure to come back on Monday for another Beauty Science or BS.","Beauty Science or BS Answer: Backne can Strike Anyone","df9107163fdcdcb63a0fc91120359ce861281fcb","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2007/10/beauty-science-or-bs-answer-backne-can-strike-anyone/"

"The Beauty Brains","2016-09-30 08:06:00","Beauty Q&A: Is it okay to mix hair care products? by The Beauty Brains Eva inquires… Sometimes, I mix my hair products together (gel and shine serum usually, or gel and a styling cream). Every once in a while the combo clumps up and gets extra funky and weird. The question: is there any way to tell which products don’t play well with others? The Left Brain explains: Congratulations on discovering a trick that many consumers and salon operators use everyday. Generally mixing products together will not provide any extra benefit, but it can be a viable way of getting the benefits from both products simultaneously. This saves time and can often lead to a better look. But as you’ve also discovered, some products can’t be mixed together. This is because the ingredients in one of the products are either not compatible or they react with the ingredients in the other. Important Note: DON’T EVER MIX THE FOLLOWING PRODUCTS WITH ANY OTHER PRODUCTS! DOING SO CAN BE DANGEROUS!! 1. Relaxers 2. Perms 3. Permanent hair colors 4. Semi-permanent hair colors 5. Peroxide (bleach) Ok, now that that is out of the way let’s look at mixing together non-reactive products. The only way to really know if 2 products will be incompatible is to actually mix them together, but here are a few examples that will generally hold true. Shampoo & Conditioner These have ingredients that form a salt when mixed together. You’ll still get the shampoo effect but almost no conditioning. This won’t be true of baby shampoos but most others. Shine Serums & other styling products Look at the ingredient list of your shine serum. If there is no water listed, that usually means it will not be compatible with styling products that list Water as the first ingredient. Without special “emulsifiers”, water and silicone don’t mix. The silicone will “blob” up and it won’t work so well. Pomades and other styling products Pomades are oil based formulas with a low level of water (if any). Again look at the list of ingredients. If there is no water then you probably won’t be able to mix it with products that contain mostly water. Styling gels and conditioning styling creams While these formulas are both water based, the styling cream will often have a conditioning ingredient in it (e.g. Cetrimonium chloride) that can interfere with the thickening system of the gel (Carbomer) causing it to create “funky lumps” that ruin the effect of both products. So, why don’t companies make products that have the effect of mixing products together? Well, they try to. It’s just that cosmetic manufacturers have to make products that will be appealing to as many consumers as possible. Since everyone’s hair and skin are different they won’t be able to please everyone with any one product. So, some products won’t work well for some people. That’s why sometimes you’ll have to mix products together to get the effect you’re looking for. And remember, there is NO product that will work well for everyone. People are just too different. The Beauty Brain’s bottom line It’s ok to mix some products together but the only way to know for sure if two products will be compatible is to actually mix them in your hand. If the mixture clumps up, changes color, or has some other weird effect, don’t use it. Otherwise, feel free. You just might get an effect that works better for your hair. And while it’s ok to mix together some of your cosmetics (except those reactive ones listed), please don’t start mixing your cleaning products. Doing so can create solutions that are really dangerous!","Beauty Q&A: Is it okay to mix hair care products?","fc7c13026f3ffc48d6cb65dcccb56512650fa167","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2009/09/beauty-qa-is-it-okay-to-mix-hair-care-products/"

"The Beauty Brains","","How kerastase kills your cash by The Beauty Brains Lauren’s on the lookout: I’ve been wanting to try Kerastase hair products for quite some time now, but they are so overpriced. What about these products make it so such more expensive than most others? Are there any cheaper shampoos, conditioner and masks that perform similarly but for a cheaper price? The Right Brain responds: In case you haven’t read our post on “ Who’s Who in the Cosmetic Industry ,” Kerastase is owned by cosmetic giant L’Oreal who markets a variety of brands at different prices. Like many large companies, L’Oreal spends a lot resources developing the best possible formulas and then use those formulas across different brands. Why is Kerastase so expensive? Can you say “brand image?” You’re paying for a different fragrance, packaging and advertising but not necessarily a different formula. High Cost For example, look at Kerastase Nutritive Oleo-Relax Smoothing Hair Masque . A 5 ounce jar sells for $50.00 and it contains the following ingredients: Water, Behentrimonium Chloride, Cetearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Amodimethicone, Potato Starch Modified, Cetyl Esters, Isopropyl Alcohol, Elaeis Guinneensis Oil, Shorea Robusta / Shorea Robusta Seed Butter, prevervatives, fragrance, blah blah blah. Low Cost Now consider L’Oreal Vive Pro Smooth Intense Conditioning Treatment . A 6.8 ounce tube will set you back $4.99. The ingredients are remarkable similar: Water, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Chloride, Glycerin, Amodimethicone, Potato Starch Modified, Cetyl Esters, Isopropyl Alcohol, and more blah blah blah. Chemically speaking, these are nearly identical. They’re based on the same fatty alcohol blend and rely on behentrimonium chloride and amodimethicone for conditioning. And the potato starch is an interesting choice of thickener/emulsifier. Functionally speaking, we’d be amazed if a consumer could tell any difference between these two products. The Beauty Brains bottom line Does this mean ALL Kerastase formulas are the same as the cheaper L’Oreal versions? Not necessarily, but we’d take a close look at each product before spending that much cash.","How kerastase kills your cash","2a28ab612b4601b3b5a574dbe7079e41d0219e16","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2007/12/how-kerastase-kills-your-cash/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Should indoor tanning be illegal? by The Beauty Brains Alexandra asks: I am just dying to find a good self tanner!! I don’t want to go tanning indoors, and I’ve used the Jergens stuff for about a month and I’m not getting the results I want. Are there any good products out there that won’t turn me into an orange? The Right Brain understands tans: It’s not surprising that the Jergens product isn’t giving you a great new tan. It has very low levels of DHA (the active ingredient that stains your skin) so you really won’t get a dark change in color. Neutrogena’s Micro Mist spray product contains more DHA so you might try that. (Read our previous posts to learn more about sunless tanning .) Sunless-tan vs Indoor tan While self tanning technology isn’t perfect, it is a good alternative to indoor tanning which exposes you to ultraviolet radiation that has been identified as a known carcinogen by the Department of Health and Human Services. To ensure that everyone understands the risks associated with tanning the US has passed a new law to explain the dangers. The TAN Act The new law is officially called the Tanning Accountability and Notification Act, or TAN Act for short. It directs the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to make sure that the language and positioning of the warning labels used on tanning devices clearly communicate the risk of irreversible damage to the eyes and skin, including skin cancer. Why you should care According to Diane R. Baker, MD, FAAD, president of the American Academy of Dermatology, “The current labeling on tanning equipment inadequately explains the serious risks associated with indoor tanning.” This lack of information increases the risk for the estimated 30 million people (including 2.3 million teens) who tan indoors. While they are not all linked to tanning, over 1 million new cases of skin cancer are diagnosed in the United States every year. The TAN Act should lead to measures that will dramatically reduce the risks associated with indoor tanning. Considering the known dangers, some people wonder if indoor tanning should be illegal. In that sense, this issue is a bit like the anti-smoking campaign. Should the government protect us from things that are known to be dangerous even though they give us pleasure?

"Randy Schueller","2016-01-12 14:57:00","Is Ojon restorative treatment any good by Randy Schueller Anonymous Asks : I was curious about what you thought of the Ojon products, specifically their restorative hair treatment. Is this any better than other products, and how would it work to improve your hair? The Right Brain Responds : Ojon’s oil treatment consists of palm oil, fragrance, and a few extracts. It’s particularly interesting because recent research has shown that only SOME oils will actually penetrate the hair. Mineral oil and sunflower oil, for example, will not penetrate. But coconut oil (which is essentially the same as palm oil) will filter deep into the cortex because it is so similar to hair’s natural lipids. Why is that a big deal? Because the natural oils in your hair help make it flexible and waterproof. Washing your hair removes some of these natural oils. So it is possible that applying coconut oil to your hair can fight some of the effects of this oil loss. Once inside the hair, the oil serves as a re-fatting agent. However, this type of conditioning won’t have much effect on the cuticle, the outer layer of hair, so you’ll still need to use a good conditioner to smooth the hair and make it easier to comb. Is it a good value? Well, that’s another question. Any other coconut oil based product should do about the same job and should be much cheaper. Off hand we can’t recommend any specific brands, but look for products that feature coconut oil as the first ingredient. (If anyone has any recommendations we’d be glad to review them. Just let us know.) Is there anything to their rain forest hype? Well, their rain forest story seems well intentioned but this ingredient isn’t proven to work any better or any differently than non-rain forest ingredients. Coconut trees only grow in tropical climates, but there’s nothing special about trees from the rain forest. So, if you like Ojon’s products and you want to support their cause AND you can afford the $55 for this product, then by all means buy it. But don’t buy the product just because they tell you their rain forest extract is better. The Beauty Brains bottom line We haven’t tested this product but based on recent scientific research, the palm oil used by Ojon should penetrate the hair. Therefore it could protect your hair from over-washing. However, at $55, it’s a bit pricey so shop around for other coconut oil products because you may be able to get the same effect for less money.","Is Ojon restorative treatment any good","1d5d2cbb9d8e0fa560e431210d250e64c3f50d01","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2006/05/is-ojon-restorative-treatment-any-good/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Does the skin lightening ingredient hydroquinone cause cancer? by The Beauty Brains Kristin`s Concerned About Hydroquinone: Is hydroquinone a carcinogen? I`ve read so many conflicting reports; and I know it`s been banned in several European countries, but it`s still being recommended by dermatologists here in the US. Just the presence of benzene in there, and its use in photographic development materials, are enough to freak me out just a little. The Left Brain Calms Her Qualms (Sort Of): Hydroquinone, for those of you who might not know, is a chemical used in skin lightening creams. It works by decreasing the formation of melanin , the pigment in your skin that gives it color. It`s applied topically to lighten areas of darkened skin such as freckles, age spots, cholasma, and melasma. Does it cause cancer? Unfortunately, there doesn`t seem to be a clear consensus in the scientific community. In the US, according to the EPA there is No information is available on the carcinogenic effects of hydroquinone in humans. This substance/agent has not undergone a complete evaluation and determination under US EPA’s IRIS program for evidence of human carcinogenic potential. They do site studies that have shown an increased skin tumor incidence in mice treated dermally. But many chemical that cause cancer in lab mice that don`t affect humans the same way. In Europe, where regulations tend to be a bit more liberal, hydroquinone has been banned. Unfortunately, The Beauty Brains are cosmetic chemists, not toxicologists, so we`re not sure of the details. But this reminds us of how different countries treat chemicals differently. For example, the US has banned the artificial sweetener cyclamates because of studies linking it to cancer yet it is allowed in 55 other countries. Who’s right, who’s wrong? Unfortunately, even science isn`t always black and white. And speaking of white, if you want whiter skin but you`re worried about possible dangers of hydroquinone you might want to avoid using products that contain it. That`s the beauty of ingredient lists “ you can read the package and decide if the product is for you or not.","Does the skin lightening ingredient hydroquinone cause cancer?","42b07766094a815438a55727d7a7c2fa354e2a20","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2007/01/does-the-skin-lightening-ingredient-hydroquinone-cause-cancer/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Makeup removers does oil cleansing really work? by The Beauty Brains Meg’s facial cleansing inquiry: Here’s a question for your lovely blog. The Internet is full of recommendations for the “oil cleansing method” which involves washing the face with various oils such castor, olive, jojoba, almond, emu, corncrake, and engine oil. There are all kinds of claims made for this method, one of them being “oil dissolves oil.” I guess that means that castor oil will remove sebum. It undoubtedly works for many people, but is that claim true? It seems an extraordinary one to make. The Right Brain’s response: Thank you Meg, it’s lovely to have our blog called lovely! While we’ve never tried corncrake or engine oil, we do know that the oil cleansing is a legitimate way to dissolve dirt and oil and remove it from your skin. Solving dissolving For one substance to dissolve another it has to break apart the chemical bonds that hold it together. (We call the chemical that’s being dissolved the “solute” and the chemical that’s doing the dissolving is the “solvent.” Chemists are good at coming up with clever names like that.) Generally speaking, there are two kinds of chemical bonds: ionic and covalent. Not to get too geeky on you, but ionic bonds are formed by the attraction of two oppositely charged atoms and covalent bonds are formed by two atoms sharing a pair of electrons. Like dissolves like When you use oil to remove oily dirt you’re employing the chemical principle called “like dissolves like.” In other words, oils will dissolve other materials that have a similar chemical structure. As an example let’s look at emu oil just because the emu is a silly looking bird and it always makes us smile. The atoms in emu oil (the solvent) are held together by covalent bonds. Now, if the solute is greasy makeup or skin oils (aka sebum), it also consists of atoms that are hooked together with covalent bonds. So that means that emu oil is similar enough to dissolve all the gunk on your face. Cool, huh? What? You want to learn more? What are you, some kind of chemical sadist? Ok, far be it for us to deny you chemical knowledge – click here to read more dissolution theory. Cleansers that dissolve Cosmetic chemists use the “like dissolves like” principle to formulate oil-based cleansers in liquid and cream form. (Water based cleansers that use detergents to remove oil use an entirely different chemistry so we’ll save that discussion for another day.) The liquid cleansers are pure oil while the creams are oils mixed with water, emulsifiers and thickners. The classic example of a “cold cream” type cleanser is Noxema. Here are some other examples. Examples of oil based cleansers 1. Max Factor For Long Lasting Makeup Type of cleanser: Oil Primary cleansing agents: Mineral oil, Isopropyl Palmitate 2. Pond’s Deep Cleanser & Make-up Remover with Cucumber Extract Type of cleanser: Cream Primary cleansing agents: Mineral Oil, Isopropyl Palmitate 3.

"The Beauty Brains","2016-10-31 08:18:00","Is my facial wash causing acne? by The Beauty Brains Erin inquires… I have a question about facial cleansers. I have a lot of problems with mild acne, nothing awful, but still consistent and annoying. I have tried various prescriptions and asked a couple doctors, and they have all said a really good cleanser is Cetaphil since it is very gentle. But recently I went to my parents’ house and didn’t have any Cetaphil for several weeks, and suddenly my acne got better. So now I am wondering if Cetaphil might be making things worse. How can you tell if a cleanser will exacerbate acne? What things should I look for/avoid??? And is it possible that it’s better to just not wash your face at all??? The Left Brain reciprocates: Thanks for the questions Erin. You’ve stimulated a brainy response. Correlation is not causation One of the most interesting aspects of your question is the logical connection you make between not using Cetaphil and the disappearance of your acne. Unfortunately, just because something is logical doesn’t mean that it is true. It’s one of the Beauty Brains Basic Beliefs: Two events happening at the same time do not mean they are related. They might be related but that doesn’t mean they are. Think about this, researchers have found that most bank robbers have eaten cheeseburgers within 24 hours of their heist. Does this mean that cheeseburgers and bank robbing are somehow related? Come to think of it, maybe that’s why they call him the Hamburgler . So too could it be the case with Cetaphil and your acne. Without more evidence or testing you just can’t know if there is a real connection or it’s just a coincidence. Based on the ingredients in Cetaphilit’s most likely a coincidence. Is Cetaphil making your acnes worse? The most likely answer for the majority of people is NO, Let’s take a look at the ingredients. Water, Cetyl Alcohol, Propylene Glycol, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Stearyl Alcohol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Butylparaben The formula is mostly water (probably 90% water). The next ingredient is Cetyl Alcohol. This is not the regular kind of alcohol that you drink but a fatty alcohol derived from coconut oil. It (along with its cousin Stearyl Alcohol) will help bind with the oily materials on the face so they can then be washed away. Propylene Glycol is a humectant that will also help bind with oily materials on the skin and provide some moisturization. The Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS) is the only true “cleanser” in the formula and it is in there at a relatively low level. It removes all the dirt and oil off your face. The last three ingredients are paraben preservatives that keep the product microbe free. We recently did a post on parabens. The bottom line is that none of these ingredients by themselves has ever been shown to cause acne. SLS is an aggressive cleanser that can be irritating to some people so that could potentially be making things worse. You could also have a chemical sensitivity to any of these ingredients but that would really be rare. Can you tell if a cleanser will make acne worse? For any specific person, you can’t really tell unless you try it. Most any cleanser is designed to improve skin appearance not make it worse. However, if you want to be extra cautious you should buy products from larger, established brands. The companies that make these products will have spent a lot of money researching and testing their products to ensure they work well. Smaller companies do not have the money to invest in testing raising the possibility (albeit small) that their formulas could be exacerbating your acne. What should you look for or avoid in a cleanser? It’s an old study, but this one published in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology looked at the comedogenicity (the ability to cause acne) of various cosmetic ingredients. Quoted from the article, Ingredient offenders include isopropyl myristate and its analogs, such as isopropyl palmitate, isopropyl isostearate, butyl stearate, isostearyl neopentanoate, myristyl myristate, decyl oleate, octyl stearate, octyl palmitate or isocetyl stearate… You should avoid any formula with these ingredients in it. This is not to suggest that the formulas are bad or will cause acne. It’s just that these ingredients could cause acne so are best avoided. One interesting note about this study is it was done in the early 1980s using animal testing. Currently, this is the only effective way to predict if a formula is going to cause acne. Since most companies do not use animal testing on there formulas any more, there is really no way to tell for sure. Is it possible that it’s better to just not wash your face at all? An interesting notion, but not one we here at the Beauty Brains can endorse. Washing your face removes excess oil, dead skin cells, dirt and even bacteria that accumulate daily. For some tips on the proper method, check out the information here. And in the event that we haven’t turned you off to Cetaphil, you can purchase it right here. What’s YOUR favorite cleanser?

"The Beauty Brains","","Do hair thickening products work? by The Beauty Brains Omgaya3 asks… I have seen a leading shampoo brand claiming that it can make hair 2 times thicker. Is it actually possible to make hair that very thick? I cannot imagine making each strand of one’s hair grow twice in thickness! Can you kindly enlighten as to how such claims have been made? The Left Brain responds: They don’t actually make the strands two times thicker. Not having seen the specific claim (the wording matters) it’s difficult to say how they are justifying it. But here is a strategy companies generally use. 1. Consumer perception – They ask consumers how much thicker they think their hair is after using the product. 2. Photo measurements – They take a before picture and an after picture and measure how much more volumized the person’s hair style is. Not a measure of thickness of individual hairs but one of volume of the entire style. (Again, you have to look at the exact wording on the claim.) The Beauty Brains bottom line There are other tricks you can do (for example, as Dreniva pointed out in the Forum, you can swell hair using high pH but this is very damaging. You can also coat the hair with a styling polymer to make it thicker. Or you can make it look thicker with a powder like Toppik Hair Building Fibers .)

"The Beauty Brains","2016-06-21 05:59:00","Does Skintactix control acne inflammation? by The Beauty Brains Lora Longs To Learn About Skintactix and Acne: As a biophysicist working on her PhD, and as a female, I absolutely LOVE your site. It’s such a great way for women to cut through the hype and get some real answers, especially about the products that seem too good to be true. I have a question about a website I found: www.skintactix.com . This site claims to have a very interesting combination of cleansers in their acne treatment products, and go on to talk very scientifically about how each works to not only kill the bacteria causing acne , but also to stop the process of inflammation at a molecular level. As someone who has struggled with acne since I was a teen, and also someone who is a bit of a dork, the thought intrigued me. Do you think that these ingredients can really stop inflammation, and if so, why don’t dermatologists use it? The Left Brain Talks Types Of Acne: Lora, thanks for your kind words about The Beauty Brains . Our mission is to educate women about beauty products and we`re thrilled that you we can be of help. Now on to your question: First, you have to realize that there are two kinds of acne: noninflammatory and inflammatory. Second, you have to realize that for acne to occur, 3 conditions must be met: 1. Oil glands gone wild Your sebaceous glands begin to produce an excessive amount of oil. This increase in oil production is typically, but not always, associated with a change in hormones. That’s why teenagers get so many zits, but it can strike adults as well. Either way, the result is that the ducts in your dermis are filled with more oily sebum than usual. 2. Chunky skin is gunky Your skin cells don’t shed properly. Normally your skin cells flake off in very tiny pieces that don’t cause any problems. But sometimes they go haywire and start to grow to quickly so they don’t flake off properly. When that happens those chunks of cells can mechanically block the outward flow of sebum. 3. Bad bacterial blockage This is caused the organism Propionibacterium acnes (aka P. acnes) which thrives in the lipid-rich sebum in your oil glands. This bacteria feeds off the oil and grows and grows and grows… When the first two conditions are met the excess sebum and the dead keratin cells clog your oil duct by forming a follicular plug called a microcomedo. (That’s where the term comedogenic comes from, get it?) This tiny plug is the first sign of acne. As more and more gunk fills up the duct, the walls of the hair follicle become swollen and distended. What was a micro comedo now becomes a larger comedo, also known as a whitehead. As the plug continues to grow it starts to poke through the opening of the oil duct and becomes visible as a blackhead. (BTW, Blackheads look black because they contain melanin, the same pigment in your skin that’s responsible for your suntan.) Whiteheads and blackheads are technically known as noninflammatory acne . In inflammatory acne the comedo becomes inflamed and turns into a raised, reddened pus engorged bump. What, you ask, makes the noninflammatory type turn inflammatory? The culprit is lipase , a chemical produced by excessive growth of the P. acnes bacteria. The lipase breaks down the oily triglycerides in your skin, releasing fatty acids. These acids irritate the skin and cause inflammation. (That process has to do with the release of hydrolytic enzymes that break down the follicular wall. But we’ll save that story for another post.) Suffice it to say that these acids can turn a simple blackhead into an oozing pus-filled volcano. So, now that you understand the types of acne and what causes them , we’re ready to answer your question about Skintactix .

"The Beauty Brains","2015-11-02 07:36:00","Is Biolustre a bogus buy? by The Beauty Brains Sarah C’s saga: I emailed you earlier about a product called Biolustre, I would like to know what it really does. I found a list of the ingredients and directions for use (from the Long Hair Community forums ). The Left Brain’s side of the story: In case everyone’s not familiar with Biolustre, it’s belongs to the Jhirmack division of the Playtex company. (Yes, they make more than just bras and panties.) Here’s the info that Sarah found: Ingredients: Water, Tert-buryl Acrylate, Methacrylic Acid, Ethylacrylate Copolymer, Hydrolozed Wheat Protein, Aminomethyl Propanol, Dimethicone Copolyol, Propylene Glycol, Diazolidanyl Urea, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Fragrance, Hydroxyethyl Cellulose Sodium Acetate Directions: Apply liberally to clean dry hair from root to end. Dry with blow dryer until product feels hard on hair. (DO NOT COMB THROUGH). Wash out completely. Style as normal. Enjoy truly healthy, youthful hair. To be honest, this product is a mystery to me. The first several ingredients are basically hair spray resins. If you put this product on your hair and dry it, I’d expect it to feel very much like a heavy hair spray. But if you wash your hair (like washing a hair spray out) there isn’t much left behind. So it appears to be more of a styling product than it does a conditioner. Weird. Their claims don’t really make sense to me either. You can read them for yourself on the Biolustre website , but I’ll summarize a few here for your edification and entertainment. 1. Bioluster is the only proven hair repair product…which repairs damaged hair and does it instantly. It works instantly: yet you have to put it on and then blow dry your hair completely dry. THEN you have to wash it out completely. Then you still have to dry and style your hair! I don’t know about you, but their version of “instantly” would take me about 20 extra minutes! 2. It will actually lay down additional layers of keratin and make the hair thicker. If the ingredient list is correct, there is no keratin in the formula. There’s wheat protein, but no keratin. So I’d love to know how it lays down more keratin when there IS NONE in the product. 3. Bioluster strengthens hair and increases the tensile strength up to 300%. This allow a no breakage guarantee if used before a Japanese straightening treatment. Besides the obvious redundancy in this claim, I’m baffled by the “no breakage guarantee.” If I buy a bottle of Biolustre and use it at home and then go to a salon for a Japanese straightening treatment they guarantee I won’t have any breakage? And if I do, what happens? Do they refund the $500 I spent on the Japanese treatment? Or do they just send me a coupon for another bottle of Biolustre? The whole thing doesn’t seem very well thought out to me. Well, you get the idea. I’m not impressed by this product. There are other options for straightening hair .

"The Beauty Brains","","Should you use teeth whitening strips? by The Beauty Brains Berni is Bemused: I drink a lot of coffee when I’m pulling all nighters and I notice my teeth are getting stained. Will teeth whitening strips do any good? The Left Brain Responds: Actually, teeth whitening strips are a real technology innovation in dental care. In case you’re not familiar with them, they consist of thin strips of plastic (polyethylene to be precise) that are coated on one side with a gummy mixture of ingredients that include hydrogen peroxide. You simply apply strips to your front and bottom teeth and let them stay there for about 30 minutes. The peroxide reacts with the stains on your teeeth and release oxygen which bleaches the color out of the stains. The result is whiter teeth after about a week or two of usage. Check out Animated-teeth.com for more details. Do they really work? Indeed they do. Clinical studies by P&G (makers of Crest white strips) have shown that they are both safe and effective. This isn’t surprising since they’re using a lower concentration of the same active ingredient (hydrogen peroxide) used by dental professionals. (Professional products contain 15% to 43% peroxide, over-the-counter products, use 3% , 6% or 10%). Of course how well they work will depend on a variety of factors including how badly your teeth are stained and how consistently you use the strips. At least one Beauty Brains affiliate has tried them and seen positive results. Is there any downside to using them? Well, there are some issues but nothing that should stop you from using them. First of all the strips really only cover the front teeth so it’s hard to get a uniformly whiter smile. True, you can’t see the back and side teeth as well, but still, it would be nice if the strips worked on them as well. Also, some people develop a tooth sensitivity as a result of contact with the peroxide, which can be uncomfortable. But there’s nothing inherently dangerous about using them if you follow the directions. For more Q & A on this topic go to Dermadoctor.com.

"The Beauty Brains","","5 ways that asian hair is different from caucasian hair by The Beauty Brains In a world where every hair care product claims to be made for your individual hair type, it’s easy to lose sight of the fact that there really are true scientific differences between hair types. For example, a study published in the Journal of the Society of Cosmetic Chemists (57, 327-338 July 2006) discovered that there are at least 5 basic differences between Asian and Caucasian hair. 1) Number of Cuticle Layers Cuticles are the protective “shingles” that guard the inner protein structure of your hair. Typical human hair has 5 to 10 layers of cuticles. Asian hair has more (closer to 10) than Caucasian (which has closer to 5). Asian cuticles are also wider, thicker and more densely packed. 2) Flatness of Cuticles On Asian hair, the cuticles are laid down with at a steeper angle. Caucasian hair has flatter cuticles. 3) Distance Between Cuticles The interval, or distance, between cuticle cells is narrower in Asian hair than in Caucasian hair. 4) How Hair Breaks As Asian hair is stretched or pulled, the cuticles tend to break off in large pieces that keep their original shape. On the other hand, the cuticles of Caucasian hair tend to break into smaller fragments and fall off. In this sense, Caucasian cuticles are more fragile. 5) Why Hair Breaks The cuticles of Asian hair tends to fall off because the adhesive that holds the cuticle cells together fails. In Caucasian hair, the adhesive holds better but the cuticle cell itself starts to break first. What does this all mean? For the first time, scientists have proven that Asian hair has a more solid structure than Caucasian hair. This may account for the beautiful long, shiny look that so many Asian women are known for. The Beauty Brains think it also suggests that Asians may need different hair care products than Caucasians. One option is Phique hair care products .","5 ways that asian hair is different from caucasian hair","0d3b9abc6af74b93f2da6cba2b6ad1c57e323424","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2007/01/5-ways-that-asian-hair-is-different-from-caucasian-hair/"
"The Beauty Brains","2015-03-02 09:04:00","Do toppik hair building fibers work? by The Beauty Brains Mel Cooley asks… Would the Beauty Brains recommend buying Toppik Hair Building Fibers for my slightly hair-impaired significant other? The Right Brain responds: Well Melanie, thanks for your question. Whether or not you want to be with the kind of guy who covers up his bald spot is up to you. But we can clue you in on the technology behind Toppik. Toppik Hair Building Fibers. Yeah, right. The hype on this one is a bit hard to swallow. Here’s what Amazon.com says: The best hair loss concealer on the market. Toppik fibers are restructured to merge undetectably with your hair when applied. It is a safe, natural way to eliminate the appearance of baldness and thinning hair. It’s not a spray, cream or cover-up. In fact, it’s so scientifically advanced that it is unlike anything you’ve ever seen before. Toppik is an amazing new complex of tiny, microfiber “hairs” that perfectly blend with your hair. Toppik fibers are made of the same organic Keratin protein as your own hair. Through a unique process, these fibers are restructured to merge undetectably with your hair. You will instantly see a fuller, more natural looking head of hair than you could ever imagine. Surprise: Toppik really works! Surprisingly, Toppik fibers really do work. It’s really kind of amazing how well they fill in and disguise a small balding area. And they even look pretty natural (assuming your guy can match his hair color, of course.) Even more surprising, the fibers actually stay in place during the course of the day. The only serious negative that we observed in our Beauty Brains test on random slightly balding males, was that if they got their hair wet (or even sweated too much) the color could smear. And of course, they’d have to reapply the product every day, which gets expensive. How does it work? The product is a fine powder made of the following ingredients: Keratin, Ammonium Chloride, Silica, DMDM Hydantion, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate. It may also contain yellow, red blue, and orange colorants to create different shades of hair. The formula is blended with just the right mix of keratin and silica to give you small hair-like fibers that adhere to the real thing. That means it works best when there’s at least a few scalp hairs to cling to. If you just smear this on a totally bald scalp it won’t give the same effect. The Beauty Brains bottom line If your man is looking for a quick cover up for a thinning spot of hair, we’d recommend trying this product. What do YOU think? Would you rather be with a guy who is “au naturale” with his hair impairment or would you like to be with someone who fakes it? Leave a hairy comment for the rest of the Beauty Brains community.","Do toppik hair building fibers work?","ed120f47fc93662e1dfec186b6dfda200541945b","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2009/08/do-toppik-hair-building-fibers-work/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Beauty Q&A: Does over-moisturizing dry out your skin? by The Beauty Brains Kendra’s question… Okay, if over applying lip balm dries out your lips, does over applying moisturizer dry out your skin? The Right Brain Replies: Kendra is referring to our post on lip balm addiction where we said that constantly applying lip balm can reduce your lips’ ability to moisturize itself. Skin deep Luckily, most women don’t get addicted to skin lotion because the skin on the rest of your body is different than the skin on your lips. Lip skin is very thin and doesn’t have the same thick, protective stratum corneum layer that the rest of the body has. Also, lips lack the sweat and oil glands that provide moisture, so they dry out faster. The Brains Bottom line Over-moisturizing the skin on your body isn’t as “addictive” as moisturizing the skin on your lips because your lips dry out faster than the rest of your skin.","Beauty Q&A: Does over-moisturizing dry out your skin?","1458989cb9e35820f9b1fc5d0a6cb18001e387eb","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2009/09/beauty-qa-does-over-moisturizing-dry-out-your-skin/"

"The Beauty Brains","","Neutrogena wave power cleanser by The Beauty Brains From The Beauty Brains Forum Member: Karen What’s pink and white and vibrates all over? If you’re Sarah Bellum, you probably have an X-rated answer. But if you said the Neutrogena Wave Power-Cleanser , then you may have discovered a fun and effective brand new gadget you can use to clean your face. According to Neutrogena, it’s called the Wave because it’s “the next wave in cleansing.” Like the Clarisonic , this product is the next generation of washcloth. Information from its marketing company says it will “take your skincare routine to a new level” by sweeping away layers of dead skin cells. But do you really need to go to the next level? What’s wrong with simply washing your face to maintain healthy skin as you age? Exfoliation Nation To answer these questions, we have to talk about something today’s beauty-conscious woman thinks about as part of her personal skin care regimen that her mother probably didn’t. That something is exfoliation. Exfoliation, simply put, is the process of removing dead skin cells from the outer layer of your skin. That might sound harsh but exfoliation is actually a natural process of the body. When you’re under thirty, your skin sheds its dead epidermis about every 25 days on its own. Once you hit 30, however, this process slows down. That’s not a good thing if your goal is beautiful skin. If that top layer of dead skin cells stays put for too long, your complexion may appear dull and uneven. It can also feel rough or dry to the touch. Exfoliation is an important step in your cleansing routine to expose younger skin underneath. If you do it regularly, you can improve your skin’s texture and help stimulate the production of new cells and collagen. The shedding process also unclogs pores to prevent blemishes from forming and allows your skin care products to reach deeper into the epidermis for better results. Additionally, it provides a smoother surface for your foundation to glide evenly over your face. Simply put, if you want healthy and radiant skin, you need to exfoliate. Scrub-a-dub-dub But who should do your exfoliation? You have choices. You can go to an esthetician and pay for her professional services. You can also do it yourself at home using a microdermabrasion kit or a facial scrub. Putting your skin in the hands of an esthetician might be a safe choice but it’s also an expensive one. On the other hand, do-it-yourself microdermabrasion kits can be intimidating if you don’t have the confidence or experience using them. I use facial scrubs, the simplest of the choices, but I’ll admit that I haven’t always had good results. That’s because my skin is prone to redness and excessive vascularity. My experience has been that if I apply too much pressure, my skin becomes red, blotchy, and hypersensitive. This is sometimes referred to as “Angry Face Syndrome,” and believe me, it’s nothing to smile about. Love the Wave! Recently, Neutrogena’s Wave Power-Cleanser with Deep Clean Foaming Pads came into my life. I’ve used it every night for one week and now I’m hooked. Here’s what I like about it: It delivers the perfect degree of gentle exfoliation that never damages my skin It’s fast and easy to use: I just attach a pre-dosed, single-use, textured pad to the top of it, run it under water, press the button, and glide it gently over my skin The gentle vibrating motion and tingly-cool foam gives my skin a nice, healthy glow rather than excessive redness My skin immediately feels softer and the dead skin cells that were problematic near my nose and chin are now gone It’s ultra light and comfortable to hold It can be used at a sink or in the shower It only takes up as much space as a bar of soap It’s been gentle enough for me to use every day On the back of the box, Neutrogena says this device is clinically proven superior to manual cleansing in three ways: 100% of women showed significantly deeper pore cleansing from its penetrating cool foam Its massaging, vibrating action opens pores to remove dirt, oil, and makeup and stimulates the skin’s surface You’ll see immediate softer, smoother skin after just one use While I can’t substantiate their claims, I did find the Wave to be one cool little gadget for consistent and gentle exfoliation with a click of the button. It requires a single AA battery included with the starter kit, as well as a two week supply of single-use, disposable cleansing pads. It comes in pink, turquoise, or apple-green color schemes. And the price? The starter kit sells for $12.99 and a 10-pack of refills pads is $7.49. So now you know why I’m excited about my new pink and white vibrating gadget. Sarah Bellum, on the other hand, might have an entirely different story to tell you. Have YOU caught the Wave ? Or do you like the Clarisonic system better? Leave a comment and let us know. Or, you can start a thread and talk to Karen directly in the Beauty Brains Forum .","Neutrogena wave power cleanser","94820c502944c1d481a228a1d29c7b72ccfa9529","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2007/12/neutrogena-wave-power-cleanser/"
"The Beauty Brains","2014-01-18 19:11:00","How honey helps acne by The Beauty Brains Emmy’s Inquiry: (after reading our post on Juice Beauty ): I like what you’re trying to do with this site, but you seem to have it in for anything labeled organic. Heaven forbid you admit that anything natural and not chemically processed might have beneficial properties – honey for example is medically proven to be anti-bacterial and is included in the Juice Beauty moisturizer, yet you make no mention of that. And since one of the causes of acne is bacteria, couldn’t it be possible that the presence of honey in the formula IS a benefit not delivered by drugstore brands? But of course, that would mean admitting that the chemicals you never fail to hype aren’t the end-all be-all answer to all beauty problems. The Right Brain replies: We can understand how you might assume that because we’re scientists that we are “pro-chemical.” The truth is, we’re pro-scientific method. If we find reliable studies that prove natural ingredients work , we mention them. But most of the time, natural claims are exaggerations to try to trick you into buying products. Now, on to your question about honey. Does honey kill bacteria? We did find legitimate scientific research that backs up the theory that honey has antibacterial properties. For example, one study in the Journal of Antibacterial Chemotherapy showed that honey (in concentrations between 2.5% and 5%) is effective against staphylococci, a very harmful bacteria. We could not find any studies that tested honey’s effect on p acne, the bacteria that helps cause zits. However, given what we know about the antibacterial mechanism of honey, it is plausible it would work on this bacterium was well. How does honey work? Honey appears to work against bacteria in two ways, depending on the type of honey. In most types, the bees add an enzyme that generates low levels of hydrogen peroxide, which is the active ingredient that kills bacteria. In a special honey, known as Manuka honey, the bees feed on nectar of the flowers of the manuka bush (Leptospermum scoparium), which imparts additional anti-bacterial properties. Both types of honey can be effective but (and this is VERY important) their efficacy can vary greatly from batch to batch. Any given jar of honey may or may not have a high enough antibacterial activity to really work. To ensure efficacy, each lot of honey must be tested for activity before you know it will really work. (Learn more about Manuka honey .) Should you try Juice? So, back to the question about Juice Beauty: IF they are buying honey that is certified with the appropriate activity level and IF they’re using between 2 and 5% in their formula, and IF nothing else in the formula is deactivating the enzymes in the honey, then it is possible that their moisturizer really is effective against acne. We’d love to hear from any of our loyal Beauty Brainiacs who want to try Juice’s moisturizer on their zits.","How honey helps acne","1afd7fe6f37a04e9f88fcdad21757fadba62f843","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2007/10/how-honey-helps-acne/"
"The Beauty Brains","","What are the best ways to remove hair? by The Beauty Brains AA Asks… What hair removal techniques, if any, work? (ie, is electrolysis permanent, does laser hair removal last and are there repercussions for skin -e.g, hardening, discoloration? The Right Brain Researches: The Beauty Brains usually specialize in helping you take care of the hair you love. But since AA asked so nicely, in this post we’ll give you some tips on how to get rid of the hair you don’t want. Types of hair removal Hair removal can be either a temporary or permanent process. (Ok, maybe semi-permanent is more accurate.) Temporary measures include both depilation (getting rid of the hair above the surface of the skin) and epilation (removing the whole hair, including the part below the skin). The effects of depilation can last from several hours to several days; epilation, on the other hand, can last several weeks. You already know how to depilate and epilate: you shave, you tweeze, you wax, you thread¦you know the drill. Permanent hair removal Permanent (ok, ok, Semi-permanent) methods of hair removal are a bit trickier. These methods are far from perfect because they rely on destroying the tissues that regulate hair growth while leaving the neighboring tissues unharmed. And trust us, that ain’t easy! Nonetheless, some success has been achieved using electrolysis and prescription oral medications. X-rays have been used as well, but this method is banned in the United States. Less success has been achieved using scary sounding methods like Electric Tweezers (doesn`t that sound like the name of a band??), Transdermal Electrolysis, Transcutaneous hair removal, Photoepilators, and Microwaves. From where we sit, electrolysis looks like your best bet, but even it has issues. Our favorite site for hair removal info, Hairfacts.com , does a great job of laying out the disadvantages. So…we quote: “Disadvantages Can be expensive. Can be painful. Can be tedious. Can be difficult for large amounts of hair. If done improperly, it can result in: partial to full regrowth lasting skin damage spread of infection Regulation varies by state, so inadequate controls exist to ensure competent practitioners. Regrowth rates have not been accurately established and cannot be predicted due to numerous variables. Some consumers do not respond to treatment.” The Brain’s Bottom Line : A variety of hair removal techniques work but permanently getting rid of body hair is not so easy!

"The Beauty Brains","","The secret that all women should know about men’s hair color by The Beauty Brains Kay’s Question: Can women use Just For Men hair dye? Is their claim that it only colors grey hair true? And if it is, how is it possible? The Right Brain’s Colorful Response: Yes, Kay, women can use Just For Men hair dye. In fact, you might already be using that kind of hair color and not even know it! Sort of. Let me explain. First a quick bit of background: Background Fact #1: Your natural hair color comes from a natural pigment in your hair called melanin. There are two basic types of melanin and they can be combined to form all the different hair colors from blonde to red to brown to black. If you have no melanin your hair has no pigment so it looks grey. Background Fact #2: Most hair permanent hair colors (the kind women usually use) work in two stages. First they use a bleach-like chemical to destroy the melanin that ‘s naturally present in your hair so it becomes lighter. Second, they add other chemical pigments that make your hair a different color. With this type of product ALL your hair gets a dose of color. Background Fact #3: Some hair colors, (like Just For Men, Clairol’s Loving Care, and L’Oreal Natural Match, to name a few) do NOT use this two stage bleaching process. They use a single stage process that does not lighten you hair – it only adds dye on top of your existing natural hair color. So if you have a mixture of grey hairs and dark hairs, the grey hairs will pick up the new color but the dark hairs won’t. That’s how Just For Men can say that they only work on grey hair. Get it? The Brain ‘s Bottom Line: Yes Just For Men’s claim that it only works on grey hair is true and, yes, women can use Just For Men hair color. In fact, many hair coloring products for women use the same type of coloring technology. But many women prefer to dramatically change their natural color and that requires using a product that employs a two step bleaching process.","The secret that all women should know about men’s hair color","b0b3679f899bd9e22d839bcb7b563320ce82b867","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2006/11/the-secret-that-all-women-should-know-about-mens-hair-color/"

"The Beauty Brains","","What’s Really Not True about Your Shampoo by The Beauty Brains Left Brain laments… I read this shampoo post over at Salon and was outraged that a credible site like that would pass on such nonsense. I am a cosmetic chemist. I’m a scientist. I’ve formulated shampoos. And I can say that many of the things claimed in the article are just wrong. For example… Shampoo Ingredients Let’s ignore the blatantly false sub-headline calling shampoos virtual toxic dumps and move along to the initial claim. According to the author “Of the 22 ingredients in this bottle of shampoo, three clean hair. The rest are in the bottle for the psychology of the person using it.” Here is the list of ingredients taken right from a Pantene Shampoo bottle. Water, Ammonium Lauryl Sulfate, Ammonium Laureth Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Cocamide MEA, Glycol Distearate, Dimethicone, Fragrance, Panthenol, Panthenyl Ethyl Ether, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyquaternium-10, Sodium Citrate, Sodium Benzoate, Ammonium Xylenesulfonate, Disodium EDTA, PEG-7M, Citric Acid, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone The first part of the claim is almost true. Really only 2 ingredients in the formula, Ammonium Lauryl Sulfate, Ammonium Laureth Sulfate, clean your hair. Cocamide MEA might have some cleansing ability but that is not why it is in the formula. Ammonium Xylenesulfonate could also clean hair but it is not used at a high enough level. The second part of the claim “The rest are in the bottle for the psychology of the person using it” is not true. The preservatives (Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Sodium Benzoate) are put in to protect you from potential disease-causing microbes. These things can & do contaminate the detergents. If manufacturers didn’t have to use these ingredients, they wouldn’t. There is no benefit to the user’s psychology. The ingredients added for formula adjustment are also not added for the user’s psychological benefit. Ingredients such as Disodium EDTA, Citric Acid, and Sodium Citrate help to adjust the shampoo pH so it cleans properly, remains stable and free of microbial contamination. The only ingredients put in purely for “psychological” reasons are the Fragrance, Panthenol, and Panthenyl Ethyl Ether. Not quite the 19 claimed by the author. What do you need? The next claim is that “One shampoo ingredient is all you need: detergent”. This is also not true. In reality, you don’t “need” to wash your hair at all. Plenty of people go through life without washing their hair and they are perfectly healthy. But if you want your hair to look better than what nature will give you, you’ll need more than just detergents. True, detergents will remove the oil and dirt but they will also leave your hair tangled and dull. To get the hair style you want, you “need” the conditioning ingredients such as Dimethicone and Polyquaternium-10 too. Does Shampoo Need to Be Thick? The claims about why shampoos are thick is just silly. It is not true that “Thickness guarantees people use more than necessary”! A thick product gives you better control over how much you use. The detergents are naturally thin. Imagine how much you would waste if shampoo was water thin. Half the product would end up on your shower floor. The thickeners are also added to the formula to help suspend the Dimethicone. Without those thickeners, this conditioning ingredient would separate out and not be effective. And another thing, Cocamide MEA is not toxic! Shampoo Fragrance The author complains about fragrance in shampoos. Clearly, he hasn’t smelled the detergents in their natural state. Fragrance is important because the odor of surfactants is not pleasant. Would you really want your hair to smell like a melted crayon? And complaints about fragrance safety are never supported by actual data. Sadly, this author relies on the public’s natural chemical ignorance and fear to create a sensational story. Animal Ingredients Few shampoos actually use animal derived ingredients any more. Not that there’s anything wrong with it as it seems a useful application of the waste from a slaughter house, but we can ignore that for the moment. No brand wants to be associated with animal products so most have stopped using animal derived ingredients. Chemical Labeling The author makes the claim that most shampoo ingredients have “several aliases and fake IDs” – This is BS. You can find the chemical listing of any ingredient in your shampoo listed in the INCI dictionary. While some smaller manufacturers mislabel their products, big companies like the ones who sell at Target and Walmart follow the industry rules. Beauty Brains bottom line Don’t worry about the ingredients in your shampoo. Despite what this author and other chemical fear mongers want you to believe, there is no evidence that using shampoo is going to cause you significant health problems. Are you afraid of the ingredients in your shampoo?

"The Beauty Brains","","Why do gray hairs look and feel different? by The Beauty Brains Here’s a question that comes from our good friends over at Women’s Health Research News . If you get a chance, please go over and check out this great blog by a fellow indy science blogger . Trisha’s question: In a previous post you mentioned that gray hair looks gray because it has lost its melanin, which gives hair its pigment. What`s the biology involved with that? What actually causes hair to lose its melanin? And is there anything we can do to slow the process down? And why do my gray hairs seem more kinky and unruly compared to the rest of my hair? The Left Brain’s Response: Melanin is a pigment that is naturally produced in the hair follicle and “injected” into the hair fibers as the protein is formed and pushed out of the head. It’s the same kind of melanin that gives your skin its color. There are two basic types of melanin (eumelanin and pheomelanin) that are responsible for every hair color from brown and black to blonde and red. No one knows why hair follicles stop producing melanin. Genetics mostly. There just gets to be a point where the melanocytes (the melanin producing cells) just stop producing. Thus you get gray hair. Slowing the process? No one has figured this one out just yet. And the truth is that only the pharmaceutical companies would be looking for the solution anyway. Cosmetic companies focus on things that do not react with your body. I’m not sure if there will be a solution to this problem anytime soon. (By the way, there are products out there like Reminex that claim to restore melanin production but we’ve seen no data to indicate they really work.) Of course you can always dye your hair. Or you can use Verseo Greyban . (It’s not a dye. Not exactly.) There is no solid data to show that gray hair has a different physical structure that makes it feel more kinky and unruly. In fact, we’ve seen experiments that show if you have people close their eyes they can not feel a difference between gray hair and “normal” hair. Why do people think gray hair is so different? There are probably two reasons: First, we know that as you age, the follicles produce less of their natural lubricating oils. That can make hair feel dry and coarse. Second, gray hairs are just easier to notice because of the color difference. Think about all the hairs on your head that are unruly but they are the same color as the rest of your hair so you don’t notice them.","Why do gray hairs look and feel different?","6b32386e32322bd322ae3ccf21b470c74e52dfa2","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2007/12/why-do-gray-hairs-look-and-feel-different/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Freckles and Age Spots: Causes & Cures by The Beauty Brains Janie’s Freaking Out About Freckles: I’m Asian and throughout the years my face is getting covered with freckles. It was cute at first when it was just on the top of my cheeks. But now it has spread to my forehead…all over my nose and on my cheeks. I was walking through Macy’s and saw Shisedo White Lucent, which targets freckles and dark age spots. Do you think this will work? Do you know of any other products that might actually work? The Right Brain hits the spot: There are many conditions that can cause your skin to develop brown spots. Sun exposure is often the guilty culprit. Here are 3 of the most common spots caused by the sun: Freckles (Medical Name: Ephilides) These small, flat brown marks appear mainly on the face, shoulders, and other sun exposed areas. They most frequently occur on fair skinned individuals but since they are an inherited characteristic they can also affect darker skin types. These spots are caused by increased pigment in the upper layers of skin so they are most noticeable after exposure to intense summer sun. They fade or disappear in the winter as upper layers of skin are replaced by new cells from below. In general, as you age this type of freckle becomes less noticeable. Age Spots or Liver Spots (Medical Name: Lentigines) Age spots are sometimes called liver spots although they have nothing to do with liver disease. This type of spot is larger than a freckle and tends to appear later in life because of cumulative sun damage. Generally, these spots appear on the hands and face and, unlike freckles, they don’t fade as much in the winter. Scaly brown marks (Medical Name: Keratoses) Brown spots that have a scaly texture may be solar keratoses. There marks are similar to liver spots in coloration but they are also characterized by abnormal skin cell growth so they’re not completely flat. Causes and Cures As we noted above, all of these brown spots are caused by sun exposure. UV radiation triggers a biochemical chain of events that results in increased production of melanin, the same pigment that gives your skin a tan. The good news is that there are some products that can interrupt this chemical pathway and stop, (or at least slow down) the melanin production. Products based on hydroquinone , alpha hydroxy acids, vitamin-C, retinoids, and azelaic acid have shown varying degrees of success. One of the most popular of these age spot fading products is Meladerm . If you want to learn more about Meladerm , read our previous post on skin lighteners. Dark spots can also be removed using chemical peels, cryotherapy or certain pigment lasers that target melanin in the skin. Consult a dermatologist to find out if one of these procedures is right for you. Finally, you should realize that the best treatment is prevention. Shielding your skin from the sun will help minimize the appearance of freckles and other dark spots.","Freckles and Age Spots: Causes & Cures","2ecb0c32a6ef16ede3d3ffb456ab772207649a72","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2007/10/freckles-and-age-spots-causes-cures/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Should placenta be in your shampoo? by The Beauty Brains One of the tasks of The Beauty Brains is to protect you, the cosmetic consuming public, from products or claims that we know are fraudulent. Even though we don’t always come out and say it, educating our readers is always in the back of our minds. (Well, almost always…) Having made that clear, let’s get right to a new product that we found shockingly misleading. It’s called Bellekiss Placenta & Almond Shampoo and its advertising copy says the following: “It’s available in a Placenta & Almond variety, it’s said to be suitable for all types of hair and for frequent use. It is a pH neutral nutritious shampoo which is said to contain vegetable placenta and essential almond oil with nourishing restructuring properties that stimulate hair growth to get shiny, firm and vital hair.” Our first reaction was: Huh? A placenta based product is a bit unusual in this day and age. But upon continued reading we realized that it contains VEGETABLE PLACENTA. I bet that right now you’re thinking: “Wait, placenta is the tissue that nourishes a mammal fetus during gestation. No where in that fetus-nourishment definition is there any mention of plants – vegetable, fruit, or otherwise. So that bit about Vegetable Placenta must be pure crap.” Well guess what? Botanically speaking, there IS a vegetable placenta! And if you don’t believe us, click HERE and scroll down to the 7th entry on PLACENTA. So what’s misleading about this product? If you read carefully you’ll see that it claims to “stimlulate hair growth.” As you know if you read our post on hair growth products , there are very few chemicals that have been proven to really grow hair. And Vegetable Placenta ISN’T one of them! The Brain’s Bottom Line There’s good news and bad news. The bad news is that this product is lying to you about what it will do for your hair. The good news is, this product is only sold in Chile, so unless you live there you’ll probably never see it. (Hey, never let it be said that The Beauty Brains don’t have an international view of the cosmetic industry!)","Should placenta be in your shampoo?","b8b8f475596c2c67b7e204f53723114725a34d36","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2006/06/should-placenta-be-in-your-shampoo/"
"The Beauty Brains","","9 tips to prevent wrinkles by The Beauty Brains This article on the wikihow blog claims to give good ideas on how you can prevent (or reduce) wrinkles . They get many things right but some are just a little off. Here are their tips. 1. Don’t blame it on your genes – They claim that genes only govern 30% of your wrinkle potential. This seems a dubious claim as they quote research from P&G who is certainly motivated to convince people that applying products isn’t worthless. Genetic effects are at least 50% of the battle. 2. Protect skin from the sun – The best advice you can get. Less sun = less wrinkles. 3. Eat, drink, slather antioxidants – While there is some evidence that Retinol can reduce wrinkles, there is limited evidence that any other antioxidant (when applied topically) has an effect. There is NO evidence that eating or drinking antioxidants will help prevent wrinkles. 4. Wear sunglasses – Can’t disagree with this 5. Sleep on your back – Makes sense but there is little evidence that this will help 6. Stop smoking – An excellent suggestion. Science has shown that people who smoke get more and earlier wrinkles than people who don’t. 7. Control facial expressions – This is silly, impractical and not proven to be useful in controlling wrinkles. 8. Be happy – The idea is that if you’re happy, you’ll look like you age less quickly. We can’t argue that being happy is a good idea but it’s doubtful that it will make you look like you have fewer wrinkles. Interestingly, they forgot to include an obvious preventative measure. Use a good skin cream daily. What do you do to prevent wrinkles? Do you think it works?

"The Beauty Brains","","GMO Coming To Your Cosmetics? by The Beauty Brains Mid Brain reports… Scientists have recently developed a way to genetically modify certain flowers to produce higher levels of fragrant compounds. This research may even lead to the development of flower-odor producing yeast lines which would eliminate the need for flower harvesting. Depending on your feelings about GMOs ( genetically modified organisms ) this could be good or bad news. What are GMOs? GMOs are plants (or animals) that have been genetically manipulated to express some useful trait. In this research, scientists took petunia plants and inserted a gene from another flowering plant to get the petunias to produce more fragrant compounds. It worked. These new plants make 10 times the odor molecules as natural petunias. GMO controversy While the benefits of genetically modifying plants and animals seem great to some people, others are appalled by this manipulation of nature. They worry scientists don’t know what will happen by tinkering with biology that has evolved over centuries. Maybe a killer plant or animal that wipes out our natural ecosystems might inadvertently be created. To supportive scientists this seems like a extremely low possibility. GMO Cosmetics good and bad To people with no problems with GMOs, this new research demonstrates a number of benefits. Reduce the amount of synthetic chemicals in your cosmetic. Reduce the amount of land required for plants to produce cosmetics Reduce the cost of natural compounds On the other hand, these GMOs do run the risk of infecting the natural ecosystem and changing things in unforeseen ways. Is it worth the risk to the environment for more natural, less expensive cosmetics? That’s not a question that this Beauty Brain can answer. How do you feel about GMOs in your cosmetics?

"Perry Romanowski","","Dry shampoo and other weird ways to wash your hair by Perry Romanowski Lately hair care companies are creating a plethora of new products designed to clean your hair differently than normal shampoos. This article about a new hair powder by Buttercream Cosmetics illustrates the latest example. They’ve even coined a new term “shampowder.” Well, we thought it was time to look at these products and determine what, if anything, they’re doing different for your hair. Weird Ways to Wash Hair 1. Shampowder – Best Dry Shampoo option? What is it? We’ve previously discussed powder shampoos so read that for more info about dry shampoos. But basically, you spray or sprinkle a powder (cornstarch) on your head and it is supposed to absorb the oil. To finish the cleaning process you comb the product out. Does it work? Yes, the dry shampoo works for absorbing oil. It also is scented so it’ll leave a bit of that fragrance behind. But it doesn’t clean your hair nearly as well as a regular shampooing. It also may leave a white residue and can leave hair feeling gross. However, if you want to skip a shampooing day or two this product is good in a pinch. It’s also good for color treated hair because it will help reduce the amount of color lost. 2. Conditioner Cleaning What is it? Believe it or not, some people just wash their hair with conditioner. As some have figured out, conditioners contain surfactants just like shampoos. The difference is that they are used at much lower levels in the formula, they don’t clean as well, and there is more oily materials in the conditioner. Does it work? For everyday cleaning you’ll likely be disappointed by using conditioner as your hair cleanser. It can start to build up on hair and feel heavy. It will also attract a lot more dust, pollen, and dirt from the air. But again, it will work. Your best bet is to use a conditioner that does not contain silicones. In this case, cheaper products like Suave and VO5 would work better. 3. No-Rinse shampoos What is it? Here’s a weird way to wash your hair without water. The formula is a real shampoo except you don’t rinse it out. The most popular brand is No Rinse Shampoo . The formula is much runnier than a regular shampoo so you don’t need water to make it foam. Just put it on dry hair, work through with your fingers and watch it foam. Then wipe out the foam with a towel for clean hair. Does it work? This formula will work better than the powdered shampoos. It can clean your hair better than a conditioner. But it won’t be nearly as good as a regular shampoo. But if water is in short supply or you just don’t feel like hopping in a shower, this no-rinse shampoo might be for you. 4. Body wash all over What is it? As we discussed previously, body washes and shampoos are similar formulas. If you wanted to, you could use your body wash to wash your hair. Does it work? A body wash will clean your hair almost as well as a moisturizing shampoo. It’ll even provide a little conditioning. Don’t use it if you’re looking for deep cleansing but for everyday shampooing, it can work just fine. 5. No ‘Poo What is it? Just what it sounds like…just stop using shampoo. According to the folks at Nature Moms, if you stop using shampoo your hair will be fine. (Unfortunately, this website propagates myths about toxins found in shampoos so feel free to ignore that scaremongering.) Here are some other interesting stories by people who have tried to go some time without shampooing. Does it work? You don’t actually have to shampoo your hair. Of course, it won’t be clean either. It will be healthier and probably look more shiny. However, it may also look and feel greasy, smell funny, and be difficult to style in any way except laying flat on your head. The quest for clean hair is never ending. Dry shampoo, No-rinse shampoos, and other products provide options Now you know that you don’t have to always be stuck using that same old shampoo. Now that your hair is clean want to know what to do with it? Head on over to this fabulous site for the latest tips, tricks, and ideas about hairstyles .","Dry shampoo and other weird ways to wash your hair","a73a56283ca105f76b01cf959b49578740a2ebb4","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2007/12/dry-shampoo-and-other-weird-ways-to-wash-your-hair/"
"The Beauty Brains","2014-03-01 21:13:00","Is Lancome lipstick loaded with lead? by The Beauty Brains KP’s question: Here’s a good one for you – a story about the dangers of lead in lipstick. I was forwarded this email from a friend (first red flag, unknown source!) What’s up with this?? The Left Brain’s reply: I’ve posted KP’s email in the Beauty Brains forum so everyone can read the entire story, but the basic idea is that the dyes used in lipsticks made by LANCOME , CHRISTIAN DIOR , CLINIQUE , ESTEE LAUDER , and SHISEIDO contain lead and will give you cancer. Furthermore, you can tell if your lipstick contains lead by smearing some on a piece of paper and then rubbing a gold ring across it. If the gold leaves a dark grey streak, the lipstick contains lead. There is lead in lipstick Your skepticism is well founded, KP, because this story is just another urban legend. First of all, all colorants allowed for use in cosmetics must pass rigorous testing by the US FDA. It’s true that dyes are allowed to contain VERY VERY VERY small amounts of lead (about 20 parts per million). But that’s far below the amount that could harm you, no matter how much lipstick you use. So lipsticks DO NOT contain dangerous amounts of lead. Lead doesn’t cause cancer Second, there’s no doubt that lead poisoning is a very serious illness. It can make you sick; it can even kill you. But it can’t give you cancer. So this is just another case where The Big “C” is used to scare people. The ringer Third, the gold ring trick is bogus too. Rubbing a gold ring across the right kind of surface will leave a dark streak. But so will a coin or any other metal object that has a bit of oxidation built up on it. Rubbing the metal (the ring in this case) can leave a dark streak whether you smear lipstick on it first or not. So clearly the streak is not from lead in lipstick. You can read the entire debunking at Snopes.com . It’s one of The Beauty Brains ’ favorite sites.","Is Lancome lipstick loaded with lead?","49e973fb63b0c67d63462a8a47794017f9b388bf","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2007/10/is-lancome-lipstick-loaded-with-lead/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Can Talika make my eyelashes grow? by The Beauty Brains Akiko Asks : This product, Talika Lipocils Eyelash Treatment Gel , claims to promote eyelash growth…. Is it true (or too good to be true?)? If it really works, how does it do this? The Right Beauty Brain Reviews Talika Well, Akiko, thanks for raising a very interesting question. Talika Lipocils (for those of you who aren’t well versed in esoteric French cosmetics with unpronouneable names) is an eyelash treatment with an interesting history. We quote the Talika website “In 1948 a young Medical Doctor named Danielle Roches was treating war casualties in the Hospitals of Paris. Whilst using a special anti-bacteria cream she had formulated with plants extracts, Dr Roches discovered that the product not only promoted the healing of wounds, but also had a dramatic secondary benefit: significant and measurable eyelash and eyebrow growth.” Intriguing, eh? Well it gets better. Talika’s website proudly proclaims that they have clinical proof of their claims. They claim their product provides “measureable eyelash and eyebrow growth” yet the clinical study referenced on the website only shows that their product helps eyelashes reach a longer “maximum length.” Read that part carefully – their study doesn’t show that their product stimulated the GROWTH of eye hairs, it only shows that more eye hairs reached their “maximum length” when treated with the product. We keep putting “maximum length” in quotes because that’s the wording used in their report. The exact description of the data is “Percentage of hairs (eyelashes or eyebrow hairs) having reached a maximum length.” We’re not exactly sure WHAT that means. But we do have a theory. Growing hair without growth If you wanted to prove that a conditioner made hair grow faster, you could do this: Measure how long it takes to grow your hair to a certain length (lets say 10 inches) without using any conditioner. Since you’re not using conditioner you’ll get some number of broken or split hairs, which you’ll want to trim to keep your overall hair style looking frizz free. So, let’s say it takes you 3 months to grow out ten inches of hair that are split-free. Now, do that same test but use conditioner this time. Guess what? Since you’re taking better care of your hair, it will get to that 10 inch length faster because you won’t be cutting off so many splits. Therefore, you may reach your “maxium length” in 2 months instead of three. Ok, now imagine that instead of going for a specific length of 10 inches, you just measure how long your hair gets with and without conditioner. Same thing, you hair will get longer, faster, when you’re using conditioner. It doesn’t GROW any faster, it just reaches its maximum length quicker because you’re not trimming off the yucky parts. (“Yucky” is a technical term.) We can’t be sure, but we think that our friends at Talika are doing their testing in a similar way. Maybe their eyelash treatment gels works like a hair conditioner. We’ve never tried to condition eyelashes and measure their breakage, but in theory that kind of test would account for Talika’s data. (Ok, ok we realize that you don’t shampoo, blow dry, and brush your eyelashes like you do your hair, but like we said, it’s just our theory. Sheesh!) There’s another possibility that’s a slight twist on this theory: Eyelashes, like other hairs, will eventually fall out on their own. What if their product just keeps the eyelashes from falling out so quick? Again, they’re not stimulating the growth rate of the eyelash but maybe they’ve found a way to keep the hair from it “stuck” in it’s follicle longer. If this is the case, that’s extremely cool! We’ve never heard of anyone ever accomplishing that feat, but heck, they’re French! Anything’s possible. Possible, but not very likely. So, since we’ve never seen any published scientific studies on the possibility of increasing eyelash growth, we’re doubtful. And the fact that their report leaves a lot to be desired in terms of the explaining the control group, base size, and statistical analysis doesn’t exactly give us a warm and fuzzy feeling either. The Beauty Brain’s Bottom Line Maybe this product does what it says, but we’re skeptical based on the data the company presents. And we’ve never seen any cosmetic product that actually affects hair growth. If anyone’s actually tried this product, please let us know!","Can Talika make my eyelashes grow?","9cb6b8e4cd68fda5305e65ec8064cb86d5977b11","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2006/06/can-talika-make-my-eyelashes-grow/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Beauty q&a: does cocoa butter work in scar removal creams? by The Beauty Brains Kathy’s question… I have been a devout reader for quite some time now, and I must say that I love your blog! Anyway, I was wondering about the effectiveness of cocoa butter on stretch marks. I was reading an article in Vogue about a woman who went on a mission to erase her scars of a once heaver self through laser treatments. However, being the average woman that I am, I simply don’t have thousands of dollars to spend of expensive cosmetic procedures. My sister recommended that I take a stick of pure cocoa butter and rub it on my stretch marks every night before bed, but I have yet to see any change. The Right Brain responds: As we’ve pointed out before, we’re not dermatologists or cosmetic surgeons. However, we were skeptical that ANY kind of cream could help scars or stretch marks. After a little research we’re still somewhat skeptical, but we have learned a thing or two about treating scars. There are many types of scars but “keloid” scars are the type that people are usually concerned with. We’ve found at least one dermatologist who says that the right kind of cream can help . Apparently, certain creams can soften the scar tissue and promote healing by realigning the collagen fibers. Massage is helpful in this process because it breaks up the scar tissue. Unfortunately, we couldn’t find much info on specifically what kind of creams are most effective in this process. Nothing in the literature we found indicates that conventional materials, like cocoa butter, will help. But we did find a reference to “extracts” that might be useful but it looks like more research needs to be done before any definitive answer can be given. On the bright side, dermatologists do seem to agree that you can reduce the severity of scars by covering the healing wound with silicone, either in the form of a sheet or a cream. Check out this link and this link for more on scar prevention. The Beauty Brains bottom line If you want to get rid of a scar, your best bet is to take care of the wound as it heals. While there is some data that suggests that creams MAY help improve the appearance of scars that are already formed, there’s no definitive answer on how effective these creams really are.","Beauty q&a: does cocoa butter work in scar removal creams?","8322f0d1353a8645b43f3e88600a70e0aa10be22","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2009/08/beauty-qa-does-cocoa-butter-work-in-scar-removal-creams/"
"The Beauty Brains","2016-08-11 07:13:00","Hair removal laser treatment works better as a single by The Beauty Brains Mid Brain reports: It turns out, more is not always better, at least not when it comes to laser hair removal . In an article published in the Archives of Dermatology , scientists report that a treatment with a single type of laser was more effective than one with two kinds of lasers. Twenty individuals were treated in various spots with a Nd:YAG laser, an alexandrite laser, or a combination of those. They found that the most effective, least painful treatment was the alexandrite laser. It had an 84.3% reduction in hair versus a 73.6% reduction of the combined laser. The combination treatment also caused more burning (an unfortunate side effect of this procedure). Does laser hair removal work? According to this research, laser hair removal does work. It is believed to work by destroying the hair follicles. The other finding was that this treatment lasts. After an 18-month follow-up, the hair removal treatment was still effective. So, if you can get past the pain of the procedure, it does work. And it’s certainly longer lasting than both shaving or waxing . Have you had a hair removal laser treatment? Did it work for you?

"The Beauty Brains","","Neem oil: a natural acne cure? by The Beauty Brains Meredith muses: Can you give me the scientist’s perspective on Neem? It’s a plant that has been called the “corner pharmacy” in India for ages. I’ve found a lot of information about it from Ayurvedic and naturopathic stores, and I’m not seeing a ton of hard science behind the claims. I’m looking specifically for info regarding its healing properties for acne and eczema. The Left Brain ‘s not sure about Neem: Like you, I’m always VERY skeptical of naturopathic remedies unless there is clinical data to back up their claims. Sometimes, these remedies do contain active, effective ingredients. Other times they do not. Interestingly, the effectiveness of Neem, or Azadirachta indica , as it is technically known, is pretty well documented. Neem, the wonder drug A search of Pubmed reveals over 400 different studies on Neem oil most of which deal with its antibacterial, antifungal and anti-inflammatory effects. The data indicates that Neem does live up to its reputation as a wonder drug, at least in many respects. There are studies showing that it gets rid of camel ticks, it’s a spermicide, stops hamsters from getting cheek cancer, it’s good for sheeps’ digestive systems, kills head lice, helps against some types of diabetes, repels mosquitoes, and stops mange. It’s also effective against plaque and cavities, can interrupt the breeding cycle of the diamondback moth, and guards against some forms of gastic cancer. To name a few. Not for acne? However, in all these studies (and I reviewed all 448 of them!) I couldn’t find a single reference to any testing on acne or eczema. Now, that doesn’t mean necessarily mean that Neem DOESN’T work. It is a plausible theory since it does have antibacterial properties. But there maybe other effects to consider. For example, it could kill the bacteria that cause acne ( P. acnes ) but it could also contribute to acne by clogging pores. Without some kind of test data it’s all speculation and hearsay. The Beauty Brains bottom line Unless someone out there can direct me to further studies showing Neem works on acne, this Beauty Brain remains skeptical. But if you want to buy some Neem oil and give it a try there’s probably little risk. But then again, why not use some acne medications that are proven to work? What do YOU think? Do you trust the over the counter acne medications or do you prefer natural remedies? Leave a comment and tell us what you think about neem or any other natural cures you’ve tried.","Neem oil: a natural acne cure?","38b88bbab26540a54e830fa86f4a1082f00afbff","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2007/12/neem-oil-a-natural-acne-cure/"
"The Beauty Brains","","How fast do skin lighteners work? by The Beauty Brains Hafsa has a question: I’ve been looking around for some lightening lotions as I have melasma. I came across a skin care range by Diana Stalder. Theres a lot of hype going around saying that Diana Stalder lightens skin within weeks or even a matter of days! The active ingredient is kojic acid. Is it true that it can help lighten skin that fast? The Right Brain has an answer: Diana Stalder is credited with starting the first Filipino-owned company offering direct sales of skin care and beauty products. Unfortunately, we can’t confirm if she’s using kojic acid in her whitening formulas or not. There’s only one distribution outlet for her products in the US (in Kentucky for some strange reason!) so it’s hard to find products to look at. And her website includes very little information about the ingredients used in her products. Krazy for Kojic We’ve blogged before about other skin lightening products , like Meladerm , that are based on kojic acid. These appear to be viable alternatives to hydroquinone, which is the “gold standard” for skin lightening but which has come under criticism for safety concerns. Kojic acid is not as effective as hydroquinone but it does appear to work. Generally, it takes weeks to see a pronounced effect. ( Meladerm claims you’ll see results in 2 weeks.) We’d be surprised if you see results in only a few days but that doesn’t mean it’s not possible. If you try this product write back and let us know how it works out for you!

"Perry Romanowski","","Is Meladerm a good skin lightener by Perry Romanowski Islida and several others have asked… Is Civant’s Meladerm really an effective skin lightener? The Beauty Brains respond: Meladerm claims to lighten skin by inhibiting the formation of melanin, the natural pigment that gives skin its color. It contains several active ingredients; the two most noteworthy are kojic acid and alpha-arbutin. Does it really work? We couldn’t find any independent test data to confirm the product’s skin lightening functionality but we did find data on the active ingredients. Kojic acid, according to the American Academy of Dermatologists, is a proven skin lightening ingredient. And Alpha-arbutin, according to several studies like this one, works by blocking epidermal melanin genesis by inhibiting enzymatic oxidation of tyrosine and Dopa. However, these tests were done in vitro, meaning they were done in the laboratory and not on real skin. In vitro tests are good for screening ingredients, but they can’t take the place of actually testing the finished product on real people. So what does this all mean? It looks like Meladerm is making what The Beauty Brains call a “B” level claim: the formula contains ingredients that have been proven to be effective; however, the formula itself was not tested. Compare that to an “A” level claim where the actual product is tested. Then of course there are “C” level claims where neither the product nor the ingredients have any proven efficacy. The Beauty Brains bottom line At $50 it’s not cheap but, based on what we’ve seen, Meladerm might just be worth a try.

"The Beauty Brains","","Secret antiperspirant: Clinical strength without a prescription by The Beauty Brains Chanelle is concerned: I have recently heard of a new deodorant by Secret claiming to have clinical strength to battle wetness and odor without a prescription. I have used many deodorants and antiperspirants in the past but none have actually worked that well. I have some concerns as to whether this particular product would be safe to use. The Right Brain shares a secret: First of all Chanelle, remember that deodorants are cosmetics that reduce body odor and antiperspirants are drugs that stop you from sweating. Over the Counter antiperspirants Most antiperspirants are available as “over the counter” or OTC drugs which means they can be sold without a prescription as long as they comply with the rules of the FDA (Food and Drug Administration). The FDA determines which active ingredients are allowed and the concentration at which they must be used. Prescription antiperspirants There are other antiperspirants that only your doctor can prescribe. These products contain higher levels of aluminum salts that can be irritating to skin. The product you asked about, new Secret Clinical Strength Antiperspirant, contains 20% aluminum zirconium trichlorhydrex glycine which is still within the over the counter guidelines but provides the same wetness protection as prescription products. Too good to be true? It sounds too good to be true, but Secret’s claims have been validated by the National Advertising Division of the Better Business Bureau: “… NAD reviewed two clinical studies supporting Procter & Gamble’s statements about Secret Clinical Strength’s performance and found that the research was conducted in accordance with U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidelines and NAD expectations for “gold standard” product testing. Similarly, NAD found that Procter & Gamble’s claims regarding Secret Clinical Strength’s effectiveness as compared to other antiperspirants are valid based on two head-to-head studies of Secret Clinical Strength versus the leading prescription antiperspirant, consumer reports of efficacy, and a survey of 200 dermatologists and other physicians who treat patients with severe underarm wetness and prescribe antiperspirants as part of their practice.” So if you’re looking for an extra wetness protection, Secret Clinical Strength Antiperspirant appears to be the real deal.","Secret antiperspirant: Clinical strength without a prescription","46645dfa6120cf8f818f460cfedddd960d4379df","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2007/10/secret-antiperspirant-clinical-strength-without-a-prescription/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Can any product really repair split ends? by The Beauty Brains Anon Asks: Do split ends serums really repair split ends? The Right Beauty Brain Replies : We’re afraid that split end repair products are lots of bluff and not much stuff. To see why, you have to understand a couple of things about basic hair biology . Hair is dead and once it’s damaged it can’t repair itself. A new strand of hair can grow out, but any part of the fiber that’s already damaged can’t heal itself. And when hair is damaged it looks like this: Despite what hair care companies might tell you, there’s nothing that can actually repair a hair that looks like that. At best, you can temporarily smooth the split by using a product that covers the damaged area with a film. But the next time you wash your hair that protective film washes away too. Products like Frieda’s Frizz-Ease work this way. Of course, the best thing you can do is PREVENT split ends by always conditioning your hair before brushing or blow drying.

"The Beauty Brains","","Will olive oil really make a difference? by The Beauty Brains Cee Gee Says… Okay, talk to me about DHC skin care products. Does the olive oil really make a difference? I use the olive oil cleansing product to remove make-up, but I’m not sure if it’s a waste of money. The Left Brain Counters: To answer this question I’ll begin by explaining that makeup is essentially composed of oily materials such as waxes, oils, pigments, and emollients. They stay on your face so well because these ingredients do not dissolve in water; if they did your makeup would run. But that also means you can’t remove them with water either. Standard facial cleansers don’t work well on makeup because they are designed to gently remove surface dirt and oil. The more gentle you make a cleanser, the less ability it has to remove heavy oils. Cleansing ingredients are generally harsh for your face. If manufacturers made the cleansers with more detergent, you could remove the makeup but you would also remove all the natural facial lipids and dry out your skin. Thus, the need for makeup remover. How makeup removers work Makeup removers use the like dissolves like property of chemicals. Since oils can be dissolved in oils, and makeup is oil based, the removers also have oils in them. When the oil is rubbed on the face, it mixes with the surface makeup and is then removed with a cotton swab or cloth. The makeup removers also contain a small amount of surfactant to aid in removal off the face. What’s left on the face is some residual oil but not much if you wipe it well. This small amount of oil can then be removed with a facial cleanser leaving your face perfectly clean without being dried out. I love olives The product you mentioned has the following ingredients: Europaea (olive) fruit oil, caprylic/capric triglyceride, sorbeth-30 tetraoleate, tocopherol, phenoxyethanol, propylparaben, stearyl glycyrrhetinate, rosmarinus officinalis (rosemary) leaf oil The formula is basically olive oil with some added lower molecular weight oils (probably vegetable oil) and nonionic surfactant. It also has a splash of vitamin E added to have something extra to say on the label and a few preservatives to ensure the stuff doesn’t go rancid. At $3.58 an ounce that’s pretty pricey. Especially considering that you could buy a gallon of olive oil for about $25. Standard makeup removers are emulsions (mixtures of water and oil) based on an ingredient like mineral oil. Here’s an example. Water, Mineral Oil, Lanolin, Petrolatum, PEG-15 Cocamine, Triethanolamine, Carbomer, Methylparaben, Propylparaben This formula is also composed of an oil, a surfactant and some preservatives. It also has a thickener in it. Basically, these formulas will work the same. The Beauty Brains bottom line So does the Olive Oil based formula work better than the mineral oil based one? Olive oil is a decent oil solubilizer but mineral oil is better. And since it`s been shown that mineral oil does not cause acne, you should not fear using a formula with this ingredient. But if the olive oil based formula is working well for you and you don’t mind spending the extra money, feel free. It’s not any better for you but it’s probably not going to be bad for you either.","Will olive oil really make a difference?","084e890c826238f2c50e790253a9499a31406214","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2009/08/will-olive-oil-really-make-a-difference-2/"

"The Beauty Brains","","Is rose oil really good for skin? by The Beauty Brains Cynthia’s feeling rosy: I LOOOVE the Beauty Brains! Thanks for everything you all do! Here’s my question: I came across a new skin care company online called Aroma Prescriptions. I am thinking of buying their rose moisturizer but since it’s over $100, I wanted to ask you guys first! The line claims that rose oil has been used as medicine for years and is great for the skin. I wanted to see what you guys thought of rose oil all over the body and if it really is known to be good. The Left Brain finds some thorns: Thanks for the kind words Cynthia. It’s always nice to hear from our fans. The Aroma Prescriptions line is interesting. All of their products are formulated by a physician who touts the benefits of rose oil . He says their flagship product, Roses of Sparta Pure Rose Oil Lotion, is America’s only physician-formulated rose oil lotion. A rose by any other name You can check out the website for the entire list of claims but basically the good doctor says his special rose oil smells better than regular rose oil used in other products. “With one whiff, rose connoisseurs will understand its significance” and “unlike any synthetic rose fragrance, this REAL rose aroma is deeply entrancing and unrivaled.” Ok, fine. The stuff smells really good. I’ll give him that. He also claims that rose oil has been used to treat chronic skin conditions like rosacea and eczema by multiple medical cultures and that it has natural anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. Let’s see if that’s true. Does rose oil really work? It’s true that rose oil contains over 300 different chemical compounds and that several of them do have some functional properties. For example, citronellol, been shown to be an antioxidant while geraniol and eugenol have antibacterial properties . A quick search of Pubmed confirms that that as far as essential oils go, rose oil is a pretty good anti-oxidant . I couldn’t find any specific references to rose oil’s anti-inflammatory or antiseptic properties. In fact, according to at least one source, rose oil can be a skin sensitizer and an irritant . The Beauty Brains bottom line Antioxidant and antibacterial properties are beneficial in skin care, but there are many ways to formulate these into a product. There just doesn’t seem to be any compelling data to show that this rose oil product is really better. If you’re one of those rose connoisseurs who love the way it smells and you can afford it – then buy it. But if you’re buying it because it’s better for your skin, this Beauty Brain says there’s no proof that this product is worth that much money.","Is rose oil really good for skin?","d756f90f6c1bd32e808980617574a66ea36f2c12","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2007/12/is-rose-oil-really-good-for-skin/"
"The Beauty Brains","2014-02-10 16:19:00","How does lip gloss work? by The Beauty Brains Alicia asks: I work at an after school program for young women and we are having a makeover day (partly because I want them to try more natural looks than the traditional teenage racoon look they’ve all been sporting). Along with makeup tips, I wanted to teach them what are common ingredients in their makeup. So what is in lip gloss, mascara, and eye shadow? The Right Brain gets lippy: Good for you, Alicia. We love to help our community learn about cosmetics. You should find our previous posts on mascara , eye liner , and lip balm ingredients helpful. And here’s a brand new post on lip gloss, just for you! What is lip gloss Most lip glosses are in the form of a gel but some companies do make a stick or pomade version. Regardless of the form, these products are all designed to give your lips a little shine and color. (They taste good too!) Typically these formulas are oil based and don’t contain any water so there’s no need for emulsifiers (chemicals that help water and oil mix together.) Let’s take a closer look at the 5 basic ingredients used in lip gloss. 1. Emollients/shine agents Many, many different ingredients can be used as shine agents. Most of the formulas we surveyed used oils (either mineral or vegetable based), lanolin derivatives, or polybutene (a type of hydrocarbon that mimics silicones. Surprisingly we don’t see many silicones used in lip glosses.) 2. Thickeners These ingredients keeps the gloss from dribbling down your chin when you apply it. Waxes (like ozokerite) and clays (like kaolin) are commonly used. 3. Colorant/Glitter While you can make a colorless lip shine, most glosses do contain some kind of colorant. Typically this is either an FD&C dye (did you know that stands for Food Drug & Cosmetic?), or an iron oxide (for earthy colors). Mica (a type of mineral based glitter) can also be used for sparkle. 4. Flavor What would lip gloss be without all those yummy flavors? The formula may also contain a sweetening agent like sodium saccharin. 5. Control agents These are the ingredients that formulators add to lip glosses to ensure the product remains stable. Examples include pH adjustors, preservatives, and anti-oxidants. You should know that some lip glosses include sunscreens.

"The Beauty Brains","","Four easy tips for longer stronger nails by The Beauty Brains Webmaster Wants To Know: I’ve stopped biting my nails and now I’m trying to grow them out. However, after they reach a certain length they would start to break. I’ve been using Sally Hansen Hard as Nails, but to no avail! Therefore, my question are: Are the ingredients in Sally Hansen more harmful than helpful to growing my nails and possible health? Are there any nail products that you could recommend that could promote stronger nails? The Right Brain responds: The idea that nail hardeners can help your nails grow longer is a myth; but here are four things you CAN do to help your nails: 1. Avoid nail polishes containing formaldehyde. This chemical can cross link the keratin protein in your nails. While it does make the nails harder, it also makes them so stiff that they become brittle so they actually break MORE easily. 2. Dont bother with gelatin . Many products claim that gelatin strengthens nails because it is made from protein, but there is no scientific evidence that gelatin has any benefit to nails. 3. Limit your use of polish removers . These products contain alcohol and other solvents that dry nails out, making them more prone to breakage. 4. Use a good hand cream or cuticle cream . Daily exposure to detergents and harsh chemicals dries out your nails and makes them break more easily. By moisturizing them often you can prevent loss of moisture and reduce the chance of breakage. Lotions with petrolatum or mineral oil are the best. You might try the Terra Naturals Nail Strengthener .

"The Beauty Brains","","Is Mineral oil good for split ends? by The Beauty Brains Catherine’s quandary: Hi there! I recently bought a product in a London Indian grocery Store called “Jasmin Hair Oil”. This product is made by a company called KTC and the ingredients are listed as “paraffinum liquidum” and “parfum.” I thought it may be good for my dry split ends. What is your take on this product? The Left Brain’s reply: While it might sound like a spell that Harry Potter would use, Paraffinum liquidum is actually just another name for mineral oil. Yes, mineral oil. As regular readers of the Beauty Brains know, many people seem to think mineral oil is the spawn of the devil, even though it’s a great skin moisturizer. (In case you missed them, here are our previous posts on mineral oil and cancer .) There’s nothing wrong with using mineral oil on your split ends but you’d probably see more of a benefit from coconut oil because it’s been proven to penetrate into the cortex of the hair.

"The Beauty Brains","","Should you be using hand sanitizers? by The Beauty Brains Penny ponders… Should I be using a hand sanitizer? The Left Brain Responds Most hand sanitizers are alcohol thickened to a gel with color & fragrance added. This isn`t the kind of alcohol you`d find in your local tavern however, it is ethanol or isopropanol. These alcohols are used because they are not potable. This way people won`t be tempted to knock back a few bottles of hand sanitizer on a wild Friday night. Some formulas contain moisturizing ingredients which can offset the drying effects of the alcohol. The rest of the ingredients like vitamins and extracts are all marketing fluff that do not really do anything. The way that these things work is simple, you put them on your hands and most living bacteria are instantly killed. The alcohol breaks their cell walls and all their critical organelles leak out. We say most are killed because there are some crafty buggers who can form spores that are immune to alcohol. That`s why companies can only claim to kill 99.9% of germs. After a few moments, the alcohol evaporates and your hands are briefly sanitized. Of course, that`s when the bacteria population starts to build up again. Think of it like a car windshield when it`s raining. Your hands are the windshield, the rain is bacteria and the sanitizer is the wipers. Sure the wipers remove the rain on one pass, but the rain (or bacteria) just keep coming back. These products probably work just like they say they will, although their claims are supported by measuring microbe populations on Petri dishes and not on human skin. There may be a difference. Unfortunately, there are no studies to show a reduction in overall sickness by the use of these products. A better option is to wash your hands with soap and water because it will actually remove all the microbes. It also has the added benefit of removing non-microbial chemicals that can also make you sick. Beauty Brains bottom line Hand sanitizers do work but don`t kid yourself, they are no substitute for good ol` soap and water.","Should you be using hand sanitizers?","80356059bf2e7f1ecbc14ffd52bbb6b970413e64","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2006/06/should-you-be-using-hand-sanitizers/"

"The Beauty Brains","","Origins Organics by The Beauty Brains From The Beauty Brains Forum Member: Taiwanese Girl I’m not a gal that’s totally into “organic” products. First, the term “organic” boggles my mind, because to me and everyone else who studied chemistry in college, organic means any compound with carbon atoms (attached to 1-4 hydrogen atoms). So since we’re composed of carbohydrates and proteins and fat (which all contain carbons with hydrogen atoms attached), we’re organic! Anyhow…. I do think that organic farming is great for the environment, whether or not the products really have any benefits to it or not. From my own experience, as well as speaking with cosmetic industry insiders, organic or natural cosmetic products aren’t any better than regular ol’ products. Intriguingly Organics With that being said, I was really interested in trying Origin’s new Organics line, Origin Organics. Origin Organics products are certified under the strict requirements of USDA National Organic Program. I’m always out to prove my own opinions to be wrong, so I began testing the products I received with an open mind. I received the Purifying Tonic (a toner), the Nourishing Face Lotion (a moisturizer), as well as a great 100% Organic Cotton Canvas Reusable Shopping Bag. The Purifying Tonic is 95% certified organic, and the active ingredients are: Organic Lavender Alcohol Blend, Organic Vinegar, and Organic White Willow Bark. The Nourishing Face Lotion is also 95% certified organic, and the active ingredients are: Organic Cocoa Butter, Organic Coconut Oil, Organic Glycerin, and Organic Rosemary Extract. Let’s start with the good first: the bag is awesome! It’s cute and chic, and definitely makes a bold statement when you take it out to shop either at the grocery store or the mall. Now, let’s get on with the skincare products. Irritatingly Organic I looked up the ingredients on Paula Begoun’s website, The Cosmetic Cop, and guess what? Most of the ingredients can cause irritation. And boy, did it irritate my skin! Let’s begin with the Purifying Tonic. With the main ingredient being alcohol, it’s bound to be drying and mildly irritating. Does it matter that it’s an organic lavender blend? Absolutely not! The smell was also horrendous, to a point that I couldn’t sleep because of it. It reminded me of this Chinese herbal massage oil called “Red Flower Oil” that my parents use. Did it soothe or calm my face? No. Did it clean and clear my pores? How do you tell if a product cleans or clears your pores anyway? You can’t. The Nourishing Face Lotion didn’t get any better. This product irritated my face so badly that it was red for at least half an hour every time I used it. After using it for a few days consecutively, my cheeks were permanently red, and I had trouble covering it with foundation*. The moisturizer itself was light, but it didn’t absorb very well. I felt like it left a greasy film on my face, and it certainly didn’t work well underneath foundation. I think it might work better for someone with drier skin that is not prone to irritations. The biggest problem I had with this was that when I use it at night, I really couldn’t sleep either because of the smell. It smells like this herbal medicine my godfather makes to cure all stomachaches, but trust me, it doesn’t smell good, nor does it taste good. Not only that, the smell was so strong! My husband would not come near me to give me a good night kiss because it smelled that strongly. Over done Organics While I applaud Origin’s efforts of introducing an Organic line that meets USDA requirements for organic products, I don’t think they made great products. The Purifying Tonic and the Nourishing Face Lotion did more harm than good in my opinion. It could be that my face is too sensitive and oily for the products, so if you have dry skin that tolerates everything, it might work for you. That is, if you enjoy the smell of strong herbal medicine on your face. But if you are super gung-ho about using only natural and organic products, go over to an Origins counter and smell it for yourself. *If you are wondering, I went back to my normal regime, which is detailed in the “Introduce Yourself” thread on the Beauty Brains forum, and after 2 days the redness was gone.

"Perry Romanowski","","Unbelievably uncombable hair by Perry Romanowski What if everyday of your life your hair was such a tangled mess that you literally COULD NOT comb or brush it? Just imagine how this could affect your self-image. Considering how important hair is to our overall appearance, it could be psychologically devastating. This is not a what if scenario for people with Uncombable Hair Syndrome (or UHS), a genetic condition that makes hair unable to be groomed. UHS is the next topic in the Beauty Brains’ Cosmetic Diseases and Disorders series. What Is UHS Uncombable Hair Syndrome was discovered by French researches in the early 1970s. They termed it “cheveux incoiffables” but it is also sometimes referred to as spun-glass hair. The disease is characterized by scalp hair that has an irregular structure and that is arranged in haphazard bundles that are impossible to comb. Fortunately, UHS is not a common phenomenon; there have only been about 60 cases reported in the journal literature between 1973 and 1998. What Are The Symptoms UHS usually starts in early in childhood. Initially the hair looks thin and glassy, then it becomes drier, curlier, and lighter in color. Eventually it becomes increasingly uncombable. The condition only affects scalp hair; pubic and arm pit hair are unchanged. Hairs afflicted with this disease have two defining features that can be seen under high magnfication: one is a triangular, or almost kidney bean cross-section. The other is a longitudinal groove or canal that runs along the length of the hair. Partial baldness is also a possible side effect because the hair is not always properly anchored in the hair follicle properly. Unlike some of the other conditions that affect hair combabilty, UHS is NOT associated with physical, neurologic, or mental abnormalities. What Does UHS Look Like You can follow the links below to see examples of this condition. It`s really amazing how glass-like the hair is; it`s easy to see how the disease has earned the nickname spun glass hair. UHS Photo 1 UHS Photo 2 UHS Photo 3 UHS Photo 4 How Is UHS Treated? There is no certified treatment for Uncombable Hair Syndrome but there has been at least one report in the literature that daily doses of biotin can make the hair more pliable and easier to comb. However, this treatment did not restore the proper shape of the hair. Another article mentions the possible use of silver nitrate compresses, mycolog ointment, and occasional antibiotics but there is no real evidence that any of these are effective. Fortunately, it`s not uncommon for the condition to automatically reverse itself with advancing age.","Unbelievably uncombable hair","b542c2b443d0895db46114302db99005bfec8cd3","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2007/04/unbelievably-uncombable-hair/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Cor-soap: Is the world’s most expensive soap worth it? by The Beauty Brains Angela asks: I recently read about Plank’s Cor Soap and I’m intrigued. Does it live up to its claims? Is this bar of soap so fantastic that it’s worth $125? Thanks for any answers you may be able to provide. Here are the claims: “Cor utilizes the unique properties of silver…and its healing properties speed cell growth and repair. Cor also contains four different types of Collagen; Chitosan, to even out skin tone and balance oil levels; and Sericin, a silk extract, to lock moisture in and keep UV rays out. This one product cleanses, removes makeup, evens out the skin tone, fades sun spots, maintains the skin’s natural moisture factor, replenishes lost collagen, and has UV protection.” The Right Brain CORresponds: Hang on Angela, I’ll answer your question as soon as I finish this phone call. “Hello? Yes, I’d like to buy 10,000 shares of Plank , the company that makes Cor soap. Why? Because they found a way to convince people to spend $125 on a bar of soap and I want a piece of that action!” Ok, now that I’ve gotten that out of the way, let’s look at ingredients you asked about. Cor’s Silver Bullet? The antimicrobial properties of silver are well documented (it works by denaturing the sulfide bonds in bacterial proteins, according to at least one theory .) However, these properties are more relevant to wound care than skin cleansing. As we recently blogged, you don’t need to use antibacterial soaps because regular soap does a fine job as long as you wash properly. Collagen can’t cut it Collagen is an important structural protein that gives the deeper layers of your skin structure. Since it’s a very large molecule, collagen can’t penetrate the skin from the outside. So a soap or skin lotion with collagen does nothing to replenish the skin’s native collagen. Chitosan is questionable Chitosan is an effective film former and can be part of an effective moisturizing lotion formula. But at best it’s questionable that it can do anything to to “balance out oil.” At worst, chitosan can’t be delivered from a rinse of product so it won’t do anything from this soap. Silk is not sun safe Sericin is not an effective UV absorber. Protein molecules just don’t work that way. Secondly, since this is a rinse off product, there are very few sunscreen ingredients that can be delivered from a rinse off product. (See our previous post on Freeze 24/7 for an example of a rinse off sunscreen that really works. The Beauty Brains Bottom Line The ingredients used in Cor do not justify its high price tag. Furthermore, some of their supposed benefits (like fading sun spots and providing UV protection) border on being drug claims yet their not using active ingredients that will deliver those benefits. But if you’re determined to throw your money away, you can get a sample of Cor soap for mere $12.","Cor-soap: Is the world’s most expensive soap worth it?","e2b66e4013a4633651becb52d0a33dfd19b21170","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2007/09/cor-soap-is-the-worlds-most-expensive-soap-worth-it/"

"Randy Schueller","2014-07-22 15:09:00","If you have little red bumps on your arms it could be keratosis by Randy Schueller CN is curious… I have these little red bumps on my arms that my dermatologist says are a condition called “keratosis.” Do you know anything about this? The Beauty Brains reply: You’re probably talking about Keratosis Pilaris, a harmless condition in which your follicles get plugged up and irritated. What’s surprising is the how wide spread this problem. An estimated 40% of the population suffers from this affliction. Here’s the quick scoop from The American Osteopathic College of Dermatology : “Keratosis pilaris is a skin condition commonly seen on the upper arms, buttocks and thighs. The skin cells that normally flake off as a fine dust from the skin form plugs in the hair follicles. These appear as small pimples that have a dry ”sandpaper” feeling. They are usually white but sometimes rather red. They usually don’t itch or hurt. Keratosis pilaris is particularly common in teenagers on the upper arms. It may occur in babies where it tends to be most obvious on the cheeks. It may remain for years but generally gradually disappears usually before age 30. Keratosis pilaris is unsightly but completely harmless. It is usually worse during the winter months or other times of low humidity when skin dries out, and may worsen during pregnancy or after childbirth.” The good news is this isn’t a serious problem and it can be treated to some extent. If you’re worried about it, go read this and this . The Beauty Brains bottom line Since so many people have this condition it’s suprising that the major skin care companies aren’t marketing products designed to “reduce the appearance of keratosis pilaris.” Maybe as the problem gets more publicity we’ll see a response in the market place. Remember, you heard it here first!","If you have little red bumps on your arms it could be keratosis","6da88a17c43936cb6a9cca6350391fe022ae4ff4","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2006/06/if-you-have-little-red-bumps-on-your-arms-it-could-be-keratosis/"
"Randy Schueller","","Can you wash your hair with dishwashing soap? by Randy Schueller Rosarita rejoices… Hey, I totally agree with Rob about too many shampoo choices . Those aisles in the big box/drugstores are overwhelming. Even relatively simple choices like soap are crazy. Too many choices in the modern world, but no, I’d rather not return to the days of Prell only. Wasn’t that stuff dishwashing liquid in a different bottle? The Right Brain responds: It’s funny that you should mention Prell, Rosarita, because that’s one of our favorite old school shampoo brands. A passion for Prell For those of you too young too remember, Prell was one of the top two best selling shampoos in the US for years. (The top seller was Head & Shoulders.) But its history goes back much further: It was introduced by Procter & Gamble in 1947. It was famous for being one of the first products in a plastic tube instead of a glass bottle and for being so concentrated that all you needed was a “finger full.” In 1950s Prell was marketed for “women who wanted their hair to have that radiantly alive look.” But our favorite memory of Prell is from the late 60s early 70s when their TV commercial demonstrated the product’s richness by dropping a pearl in the bottle in will slink slowly to the bottom. You can see another nostalgic, albeit a bit creepy, commercial by clicking the link below. Trust me, it’s worth it. Unfortunately, modern shampoo users haven’t shown the same passion for Prell and in 1999 Procter & Gamble sold the brand to Prestige Brands International. You can still find it in some stores – if you’re lucky. Dissing dishwashing soap But back to your question – was Prell just dishwashing soap in another bottle? While we can’t go back in time and look at the ingredients used in the first Prell formula back in 1947, we can tell that the “modern” version is a pretty standard deep cleansing formulas based on ammonium lauryl and laureth sulfates and cocamide DEA. These have been commonly used for decades and are certainly NOT just a dishwashing formula. Those are based on other surfactants designed for cutting grease and have a different cleansing and foaming profile. So another urban myth bites the dust. (BTW, you could wash your hair with dishwashing soap but it would likely dry out your scalp and leave your hair feeling like straw.)

"The Beauty Brains","","Silk pillowcases do not make you a sleeping beauty by The Beauty Brains The Left Brain updates: I created quite a stir in the world of silk pillow cases last year when I tried to answer the question “ Are Silk Pillow Cases Good For Your Skin ?” (Follow the link for the original post and all the entertaining comments.) Silk from a sow’s ear? According to the ASA (the UK organization that enforces British advertising laws) it looks like I was right. Cosmeticsdesign reports that they have ruled that Direct Beauty Products have not adequately supported their advertising claims that their silk pillow cases have anti-aging properties. A key issue was the lack of support for minimizing wrinkles. In this particular ad, the company even went so far as to imply that cotton and polyester pillow cases are a major cause of aging, second only to sun damage! Despite the fact that the company presented a study from the American Academy of Dermatology suggesting that silk pillowcases might reduce sleep lines and wrinkles, the ASA upheld the complaint and said the advertisement must be removed from circulation. It’s nice to see a governmental body looking out for truth, honesty, and the scientific way! Now if the ASA could just go after Kinoki Detox Foot Pads .","Silk pillowcases do not make you a sleeping beauty","76c77992e14832e0ff5610fd282e43ae530973c6","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2009/11/silk-pillowcases-do-not-make-you-a-sleeping-beauty/"
"The Beauty Brains","2017-01-06 10:21:00","Can yeast infection creams boost hair growth? by The Beauty Brains Ninon D’s delightful question : I’ve been reading an interesting thread on the Long Hair Care Forum . It seems that some of the women there are using a cream marketed to treat thrush on their scalps to boost hair growth. The mind somewhat boggles at how anyone stumbled upon this idea, however lots of the women are reporting increased growth from creams containing miconazole nitrate such as Monistat . I’d be curious to know what your take is on this – genuinely beneficial, benign or bonkers? The Left Brain ’s skeptical response: You’re right Ninon, the idea that miconazole nitrate (the active ingredient in Monistat ) can stimulate hair growth is all over the Long Hair Forum . They make several mentions of medical studies that says miconazole works, but I was unable to find any such studies. (If anyone from the Long Hair Forum reads this, please let me know which reports you’re referring to.) Can anti-fungals help hair growth? The only credible research on this topic that I could find comes from a report issued by the Department of Internal Medicine, Naval Hospital, Bethesda, Maryland entitled “ Ketoconazole Binds to the Human Androgen Receptor .” Ketoconazole, for those of you not up on your imidazole chemistry, is another antifungal which is a cousin of miconazole. The Bethesda report says that lab tests showed ketoconazole can interact with androgen receptors and therefore can inhibit testosterone levels. What does all this mean? Since androgen and testosterone levels are associated with androgenetic alopecia (male pattern baldness), it’s THEORETICALLY possible that this chemical could affect hair loss. However, this test did NOT evaluate hair growth, it only showed that this drug MIGHT be involved in PART of the metabolic pathway that leads to baldness. Furthermore, the study also says that “ the dose of ketoconazole required for 50% occupancy of the androgen receptor is not likely to be achieved in vivo…” So even if this reaction can be observed in the laboratory it doesn’t seem very realistic to expect it would work on people. So should I put Monistat on my scalp or not? And what about our miconazole? The researchers said “androgen binding studies performed with other imidazoles, such as clotrimazole, miconazole, and fluconozole, revealed that in this class of compounds only ketoconazole appears to interact with the androgen receptor.” So even in lab tests at high levels, miconazole DOES NOT show any effect. The Beauty Brains bottom line The only report I was able to find does not support using miconazole for hair growth. Of course it’s possible that there are other studies out there showing a cause and effect. If anyone comes across them, please send them to me for review. I’ll gladly revise my position based on new data. But without some kind of study and plausible mechanism, I remain skeptical that yeast infection creams can increase hair growth.","Can yeast infection creams boost hair growth?","fd8dfd61bbe740db85669fb197be7a9e1f321561","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2007/12/can-yeast-infection-creams-boost-hair-growth/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Yummy Yogurt: Better for Beauty? by The Beauty Brains Bacteria isn’t all bad. At least that’s what the folks at some cosmetic companies try to tell you. Welcome to the wonderful world of Probiotics . Good bacteria found in certain foods that is supposed to be great for your skin & hair. Prepare yourself for the latest wave of new probiotic products. Cosmetic yogurt anyone? Eat yogurt for better skin? Leading off this yogurt trend was Danone with its recently launched cosmetic yogurt called Essensis. Charlotte of Kiss and Makeup tipped readers off to this product a few months ago and here’s a bit more information . When you eat this product, it’s supposed to nourish the skin from within and create a radiant complexion. They even coined a clever term, “skingestibles” which are foods with ingredients that are supposed to help your skin. The company sites a clinical study showing daily consumption prompted panelists to report healthier to more beautiful skin. Of course, this study isn’t published in a peer reviewed journal, so its conclusions remain dubious. It would be nice to know if they compared it to other yogurts, to other foods, or to skin lotions. We suspect not but can’t know for sure. If you’ve tried Essensis, let the Beauty Brains community know what you thought. Yogurt on your body Next up on the yogurt bandwagon is Bioelements with Probotix Anti-Aging Serum . The makers of this product want you to believe putting yogurt on your skin will have the same immune-boosting effect as eating it. Interesting concept but the outside of your body is different than the inside. It sounds a bit like saying you can build up leg muscles by soaking them in a steak puree. Would anyone buy Mystic Mignon? A few other yogurt entries include Korres Yoghurt Cooling Gel : a UV protecting cream (I’d stick with a real sunscreen) Davines Well Being System : Yogurt powder to strengthen and moisturize hair. Not sure how this would work. Goldwell Y-Shine complex with Yogurtene . Yogurtene is a mix of lactose, protein and vitamins. I’m not sure yogurtene is any different than a simple mixture is but it sounds cute. Vogue International Organix Smoothing Shea Butter Shampoo – It has yogurt proteins. Don’t count on them working any different than other proteins. Proteins can help strengthen hair but the specific kind doesn’t really matter. The Face Shop – Yogurt facial care . A standard skin mask formula put into yogurt containers. You don’t eat it, you put it on your face. Are yogurt beauty products better? So, with all these yogurt based products coming out should you really expect to see any added benefit? Not likely. First, there is almost no proof that eating any specific food will improve your skin condition. And certainly if a food could impact skin’s condition it would pale in comparison to the effect of standard skin lotions. These things are put right on the skin. They don’t have to travel through the entire body to get to the skin. Second, while protein has been shown to be beneficial to both hair and skin, the specific type of protein doesn’t really matter. When companies make these ingredients they react or “hydrolyze” the protein to make them all the same. There will be slight variations but it won’t markedly effect performance. The Beauty Brains bottom line I love yogurt, but the idea of wearing it borders on silliness. And the lack of published research on the benefits of worn food convinces me that it’s marketing hype. If you like yogurt, put it in your mouth. Stick with standard products everywhere else.","Yummy Yogurt: Better for Beauty?","4462df804c30b685c9299cf75f3227fe477f4a14","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2007/04/yummy-yogurt-better-for-beauty/"
"Randy Schueller","","Top 10 split end busters by Randy Schueller One of our fave forums for hair facts is The Long Hair Forum. If you want to grow your hair longer, it is THE site to see. They have a great list of tips that we’re sharing with you in today’s post. Click here to read their orginal list: “ Keeping Splits At Bay: Secrets of Gently Handling Your Hair” 1) Move Your Mane If your hair is long enough to get caught under coat collars or under shoulder straps (for Messenger bags, back pack, etc) then be sure to move your hair before putting on that bag. 2) Keep Air off Your Hair Does your hair whip in the wind? Wind knots up hair. Knots damage length. Damaged length causes more splits. Eventually the damaged length splits. Restrain your hair when you are going to be in a lot of wind. 3) Wash Warily Only apply shampoo to roots where it needs it. Avoid washing the dried out ends. 4) Be Picky About Piling Hair On Top Do you pile your hair on top of your head when you shampoo? This creates MANY opportunities for splits. Shampoo really only needs to be applied to your roots. That’s where the grease/oil is. Personally, I condition the length of my hair, apply shampoo to my scalp (down to ears), rinse, then apply conditioner again, rinse. This is called CWC (Condition Wash Condition). All the while, the length of my hair just hangs down my back. 5) Towel Drying is Treacherous When you dry your hair, do you scrub your scalp with a towel? It feels great, but it will rip, strip, pop, snap and fry your hair in no time! Many of us use some sort of a turbie type towel/turban for drying our hair. Others put a towel on their back and let the hair drip onto the towel. 6) Blow Off Blow Drying Do you blow dry your hair? The heat and the wind created by the blowfryer (no that isn’t a typo) really damages hair, too. Any heat styling tool can potentially damage hair. If you feel you must use them, keep the temperature low and exposure time to your hair short. 7) Subdue Your Shampoo How often do you shampoo? Regardless of HOW you shampoo, how OFTEN do you do it? Many of us have found that 2-3 shampooings per week is sufficient. It takes a few weeks to train your scalp to have fewer washings, but it helps protect the ends. Not everyone has success with fewer shampooings, though. 8) Condition, condition, condition Do you use conditioner or a cream rinse when you shampoo? My personal belief is, if you want long hair you need to condition it EVERY time you shampoo. If nothing else, it helps detangle my hair. You also might consider using a leave in conditioner, especially one that helps detangle (and gives slip). 9) Oil Often You can oil the length of your hair daily. Many long hairs do this. They put a small drop in the palm of their hand, rub their hands together and lightly apply the oil to the ends only of the hair. There is an abundance of oils that you can use, some are quite exotic. Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) is probably the most common, but there is a long list of oils everyone has tried and ones that each person likes/doesn`t like. 10) Consider Combing Cautiously After you’ve shampooed, when/how do you brush/comb your hair? Generally, brushing wet hair is bad for the hair. Hair is most delicate when wet. Brushing tends to stretch the strands. Stretching the strands puts wear and tear, which causes damage, which causes splits.","Top 10 split end busters","2af63e87778dfb8284f9427983961edd508cff62","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2006/11/top-10-split-end-busters/"
"The Beauty Brains","","The most dangerous cosmetic in the world by The Beauty Brains Alexia asks: I was genetically condemned with the most colorless lashes in the world, which make me look like an alien or a corpse (or maybe an alien corpse?) I was thinking about dying my lashes but I found that it’s illegal in some places because several people went blind! Then, I found a product called Colorsport 30-day Mascara, which is supposed to be a permanent eyelash color. I’m desperate to try it, but I’m also partial to eyesight. Will I go blind if I dye my lashes? The Right Brain shows her the light: You’re right, Alexia, in the U.S. eyelash dying products are considered to be illegal and unsafe. What is eyelash dye? Eyelash dying products use the same kind of dyes as permanent hair colors. For example, the Colorsport product you mentioned contains 2-Chloro-p-phenylenediamine; 2,6 Diaminopyridine and m-Aminophenol. These chemicals are referred to as “oxidative dyes” because they must be mixed with an oxidizing agent (usually hydrogen peroxide) before they will work. The oxidizing agent causes the dye molecules to polymerize, or link together, to create intense shades. Why is dying lashes dangerous? Oxidative dyes are very reactive chemicals and can induce an allergic reaction in some people that causes painful rash or even blistering. That’s why permanent hair colors instruct you to test the product on a small spot of your skin before applying it to your scalp. (Not many people do it, but read the label on your Clairol or L’Oreal dye and you’ll see it.) Since your eyes are even more sensitive than your scalp, an allergic reaction there is much more dangerous. There have been a few cases, dating back to the 1930s, of women being blinded (and even killed!) from allergic reactions to these kinds of dyes. That’s why the U.S. FDA says these dyes represent “an acute, severe hazard to health with the possibility of permanent injury; i.e.,impaired sight, including blindness.” “ Permanent eyelash and eyebrow tints and dyes have been known to cause serious eye injuries, including blindness . There are no color additives approved by FDA for permanent dyeing or tinting of eyelashes and eyebrows.” How can Colorsport sell an illegal product? There are two reasons : First, Colorsport is made in the UK and these products are not illegal there because the jurisdiction of the FDA is limited to the US. For reasons we can’t fathom, the European Union does not seem to be as concerned about this danger and so there are several eyelash dyes available in the UK. The FDA tries to stop these products from being brought into the US but it’s tough to stop people from ordering them online. Second, there are salons in the US that still offer this service but they’re just that are just ignoring the law (and the danger!) They use the argument that “I’ve been dying eyelashes for years and never had a problem.” But the reality is, every credible source on this topic says that the risk is not worth the reward. So stick with a good mascara and leave the hair dyes off your lashes.","The most dangerous cosmetic in the world","e643d489dd5582e289ec73b494fafe13437ddec6","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2007/09/the-most-dangerous-cosmetic-in-the-world/"

"The Beauty Brains","","How do 2 in 1 shampoos work? by The Beauty Brains As a follow-up to the last shampoo post we thought we’d show you a comparison between a 2-in-1 shampoo plus conditioner and a supposed regular shampoo. Undoubtedly, the best 2 in 1 technology was created by the good folks at P&G back in the mid 1980′s. The original patent is right here . This technology led to the phenomenal success of a shampoo called Pert Plus. That shampoo is still around but sales have been withering ever since Pantene was introduced in the mid 1990s. Ironically, except for the fragrance and color these formulas are very much the same. 2 in 1 shampoo technology So what is this 2 in 1 technology? Essentially, it is 2 ingredients added to a regular shampoo, a silicone and a suspending agent. The silicone is usually an ingredient called Dimethicone and it is what makes the formula conditioning. The suspending agent is Glycol Distearate and it is what keeps the silicone from separating out of the formula. The way it works is this¦when the bottle of shampoo is sitting on the shelf, the suspending agent is able to hold the silicone in the formula. But when you put the shampoo on your head and mix it with water, the suspending agent does not work so well. The silicone separates out, stays behind on your hair where it can provide conditioning. That’s the theory anyway and it actually works. Now that you know a bit about the 2 in 1 technology let’s do a comparison of a 2 in 1 shampoo and a regular shampoo. Here is the ingredient list of a 2 in 1: Pantene Pro-V Shampoo + Conditioner, Classically Clean Water, Ammonium Laureth Sulfate, Ammonium Lauryl Sulfate, Glycol Distearate, Sodium Chloride, Cocomide MEA, Dimethicone, Cetyl Alcohol, Fragrance, Sodium Citrate, Polymethacrylamidopropyltrimonium Chloride, Sodium Benzoate, PEG-14M, Dihydrogenated Tallowamidoethyl Hydroxyethylmonium Methosulfate, Disodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Panthenol, Panthenyl Ethyl Ether, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Ammonium Xylene-Sulfonate Water, Ammonium Laureth Sulfate, Ammonium Lauryl Sulfate, Glycol Distearate, Cocamide MEA, Panthenol (Pantene Pro-Vitamin Complex), Panthenyl Ethyl Ether (Pantene Pro-Vitamin Complex), Lysine HCl (Pantene Amino Protein Complex), Methyl Tyrosinate HCL (Pantene Amino Protein Complex), Histidine (Pantene Amino Protein Complex), Dimethicone, Fragrance, Cetyl Alcohol, Sodium Citrate, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Benzoate, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Disodium EDTA, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Trimethylolpropane Tricaprylate/Tricaprate, Citric Acid, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Ammonium Xylene-Sulfonate Notice any similarities? The first 4 ingredients are exactly the same. But more importantly, both contain the 2 in 1 technology, Glycol Distearate and Dimethicone. Just so you don’t think we’re picking on Pantene, other brands do the same thing for example Fructis (their 2 in 1 vs their normal both contain Dimethicone). And even your favorite salon brands do it too. So why do these companies add 2 in 1 technology to regular shampoos? Mostly because the added conditioning helps prevent the hair from being so clean that it feels dry. Almost any shampoo will do an excellent job of removing the oil and dirt from your hair. Take out too much however; you’ll get a head of hay. Beauty Brains Bottom Line If you want a clarifying or normal shampoo then DO NOT use one that contains Dimethicone. Despite what it says on the label if a shampoo contains Dimethicone it is a conditioning shampoo.","How do 2 in 1 shampoos work?","4b1faa34c617ac20938c7bd10ebc5d6ad00667bf","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2006/06/how-do-2-in-1-shampoos-work/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Will the next skin lightening technology come from Chinese flowers by The Beauty Brains We get a lot of questions about skin lightening products like Meladerm so I thought you’d like to know that researchers say a Chinese flower holds potential as natural skin lightening ingredient. Flowers for Algernon? The Asian plant, Osmanthus fragrans, is already commonly used for flavoring tea and other beverages and is sought after as a fragrance ingredient. But now, according to Taiwanese scientists, it may be the next hot skin lightening technology. Researchers led by Li-chen Wu from National Chi Nan University have shown that Osmanthus fragrans extract can potentially inhibit the action of the enzyme tyrosinase which is involved in the synthesis of melanin. Melanin is the pigment that is responsible for darkening your skin. (It also gives us sun tans.) In vitro research has shown the extract causes a reduction in tyrosinase activity and melanin formation in a dose-dependent manner. But it’s not clear if the mechanism could work from topically applied products or if it has to be ingested or injected. Best of all, it’s evidence that natural ingredients can really work. And we all know how that upsets the Left Brain!

"The Beauty Brains","","Diesel Fuel for Life Fragrance by The Beauty Brains The Beauty Brains Forum Member Purple Rules reviews Diesel Fuel For Life fragrance . The bottle for Diesel Fuel For Life warns me to “use with caution.” I don’t know why. It’s not a daring fragrance; no need to worry about emptying the elevator with this. Sniffing Skittles The fruity top notes smell just like Skittles! Then it dries down to very generic, fruity heart notes but it’s an artificial fruity smell like the overly sweet, fruit candy that kids like. It’s almost medicinal at times and then it becomes very powdery and slightly less sweet at the end. You’re an animal It’s described as having “a heart of jasmine, intensified by indole, a floral-animal note that is found naturally in jasmine” but I get none of that. Indole doesn’t smell particularly good on its own (it’s often described as smelling fecal or like cat pee) but when combined with other notes, it gives them weight and depth. It can also take the edge off florals that are too sweet or too nice; it’s dirties them up a bit. It’s often combined with jasmine, which may explain why Fuel For Life reminds me of so many other fragrances that are popular now. Fragrances containing indole are often described as being animalic and sensual but I wouldn’t describe Fuel For Life as either. It’s fruity, then it’s powdery and then it’s gone. Cheesy packaging The bottle is not terribly attractive. It’s described as being covered in lace but it looks more like cheesecloth to me. This is not fragrance that I would normally be drawn to. Most fragrances that are described as “fruity” are cloying on me, although they may smell great on others.

"Perry Romanowski","","Does ultrashape really melt away body fat? by Perry Romanowski Lucia longs to learn: I’ve heard about a method called UltraShape , which claims it can literally melt fat with ultrasound without affecting surrounding tissues. The best part is, you can melt a pound of fat without anesthesia and then go right away to your daily routine. Is that possible? How can they make sure they are not burning other tissues? Is it available in the US? The Left Brain responds: UltraShape is a type of non-invasive body contouring that uses focused ultrasound waves to melt away body fat without an incision. Each treatment takes about an hour and you can go right back to work after the session. The FDA is expected to approve UltraShape for use in the US in 2007 but at the time of this writing, I couldn’t confirm if that has actually occurred yet. We couldn’t find any peer reviewed scientific literature that documented the effectiveness of UltraShape, but unlike cellulite creams like Murad or Cellulean this method does appear to work to some extent. However, there are some limitations. First, unlike liposuction, this procedure doesn’t work on large fat deposits so it won’t help you lose belly fat . That’s because it breaks down the fat but the body has to process the melted fat cells. Second, you can’t treat fat that is located under tattoos or scar tissue . And third, you’re supposed to maintain a negative calorie intake for four day after treatment to make sure the released fat is properly processed by your body. While the process is claimed to be safe, there is a slight risk of medical side effects so you should ask your doctor if you’re seriously interested in this procedure. Finally, check out the before and after pictures on the UltraShape website . It’s interesting that most of the people do look a bit better in the after picture, but they really don’t look that bad in the before picture in the first place! You have to decide if the expense of this treatment (about $1000 per session) is worth such limited results. If anyone in the Beauty Brains community has tried this method, let us know what you think.","Does ultrashape really melt away body fat?","cb174d5d2b47f739ec606ff10bc4970cf3bdb606","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2007/03/does-ultrashape-really-melt-away-body-fat/"
"Randy Schueller","None","The top 5 myths about mineral oil part 1 by Randy Schueller We often see the advice that people should avoid mineral oil at all costs. This idea is propagated by numerous “natural” companies. Well, this advice is just bogus. It’s not based on any scientific studies. Mineral oil is a perfectly fine ingredient and has been used in cosmetics for over 100 years. Here are the top 5 Myths that companies tell people to make them afraid of mineral oil. In part 2 we look at why “natural” companies would be trying to scare you. Mineral Oil Myths 1. Mineral oil is contaminated with carcinogens . While it’s true that some petroleum derivatives contain carcinogenic materials (like some polycyclic aromatic compounds) the mineral oil that is used in the cosmetic and pharmaceutical industry is highly refined and purified. It’s purity is even regulated by the US FDA and other international regulatory agencies. There is absolutely no evidence that cosmetic grade mineral oil causes cancer. And there has been plenty of testing done to ensure that fact. We could find no published reports in any of the dermatological or medical journals indicating a link between mineral oil and any forms of cancer. 2. Mineral oil dries the skin and causes premature aging. Mineral oil works as a barrier between the skin and the air. It acts as an occlusive agent which prevents water from naturally leaving your body through your skin. It will not dry out your skin or cause premature aging. Quite the contrary. It will provide moisturization. 3. Mineral oil robs the skin of vitamins . Since many vitamins are oil based, people assume that mineral oil will pull them out of your skin. There is no legitimate scientific evidence that this is true. Mineral oil has no effect on the vitamin levels in your skin. 4. Mineral oil prevents absorption of collagen from collagen moisturizers. Collagen in your skin lotions and moisturizers is too big to actually penetrate your skin. Therefore, mineral oil will have no effect on whether the collagen gets absorbed or not. 5. Mineral oil causes acne. In some people, mineral oil can exacerbate acne problems. However, most people will not experience any problems. So, if it is not for safety concerns, why would companies be telling you to avoid mineral oil? We’ll look at that in part 2 of our series on mineral oil .","The top 5 myths about mineral oil part 1","bb0b0e673aa68c41dfefda3b42fc012ef348fe49","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2006/11/the-top-5-myths-about-mineral-oil-part-1/"
"The Beauty Brains","","5 home beauty gadgets that really work by The Beauty Brains Megan’s Musing: I’ve read that an at-home tool called a Wellbox is supposed to help reduce the appearance of cellulite. Has anyone tried this device with promising results, or is this a waste of (significant) money? The Right Brain Responds: Megan, we’ve blogged about cellulite treatments before, and they really don’t do much. At best they only give you a very minor, temporary effect so you should probably save your money. But you might be interested to know that there ARE several new beauty gadgets on the market that really do work. At least according to a Dermatology Times article that quotes Dr. Thomas Rohrer, M.D., clinical associate professor of dermatology, Boston University Medical Center. He says that “We are getting to the point where, for certain things, patients may be able to treat themselves safely and fairly effectively at home.” However, Dr. Rohrer also points out that these treatments are still less effective than the devices used by physicians: “They’re not going to be nearly as powerful” but “they may be effective enough…to improve some conditions.” Here are 5 beauty gadgets that Dr. Rohrer says really work: 1. Hair-removal (the Epila SI 808 Laser and the Spa Touch from Radiancy) According to Dr. Rohrer, Spa Touch showed moderate efficacy with patients reporting an average 66% reduction in unwanted hair counts . At nine months follow-up, patients noted about a one-third reduction. Furthermore, there were a minimal side effects. 2. Hair loss ( HairMax LaserComb from Lexington International LLC) This device is one of only three treatments that are FDA-approved for hair growth. Dr. Rohrer says that “in a 26-week, multi-center, placebo-controlled study with this device, 93 percent of subjects noticed an increase in hair count.” 3. Acne devices ( Zeno from Tyrell and ClearTouch Lite from Radiancy) Both devices thermally treat acne lesions and according to the Dr., Zeno achieved 90 percent reduction in lesion counts in one to two days. 4. Facial photo-rejuvenation ( NuLase from NuLase International LLC) and ClearTouch Lite from Radiance) Light Emitting Diode devices are safe, relatively pain-free, and can provide “subtle but real changes in the skin.” 5. Facial Toning (Facial Toning Device from Radiancy) Dr. Rohrer claims the Radiancy devices uses LHE technology and is capable of reducing age spots and wrinkles. However, the study he cited has not yet been published so we’re more skeptical on this one.","5 home beauty gadgets that really work","2c9a6017594f046d4dbe9df899d30959d6d5ee34","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2007/09/5-home-beauty-gadgets-that-really-work/"
"The Beauty Brains","2014-01-29 17:31:00","Is monistat bikini chafing gel a good makeup primer? by The Beauty Brains Cassie’s cautious: Hi Beauty Brains, wonderful site- I check it everyday! Today I have a question regarding using Monistat chafing gel as a primer for your makeup. I frequent other makeup blogs and one girl swears by this product as her makeup primer. She says the texture is the same as the Smashbox Photo Finish Primer, as well as the Camellia Rose Skin Soothing Primer. It’s definitely a nice cheaper alternative to expensive primers. I’m concerned about trying something that it was not designed. What do you think about using Monistat Chafing Gel as face primer? The Right Brain’s reassuring: You’re smart to be cautious about proper product usage, Carrie, but in this case there seems to be little cause for alarm. This Monistat formula looks very suitable for use as a make up primer. What are makeup primers? Makeup primers are used to lay down a nice smooth surface that powders can evenly adhere to. And when it comes to forming smooth surfaces, it’s tough to find better ingredients than silicones. There are TONS of silicones to choose from but here are a couple of key ones: Dimethicone: Forms a water proof barrier. Can feel heavy if not properly formulated. Cyclomethicone/cyclopentasiloxane: Very lightweight spreading agent. Mostly evaporates after you’ve applied it. Dimethicone cross polymers: These are dimethicone combined with another molecule and they can have many different properties depending on what that other molecule is. One type of cross polymer gives the powdery smooth finish that Monistat talks about. Does Monistat make a good make up primer? Let’s take a look at the main ingredients in Monistat as compared to makeup primers like the ones Carrie asked about. Monistat Chafing Gel Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Trisiloxane, Dimethicone/Vinyldimethicone Crosspolymer, Silica Smashbox Photofinish Primer Cyclomethicone, dimethicone crosspolymer Camellia Rose Skin Smoothing Primer Dimethicone, Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Silica, Squalane The Beauty Brains bottom line Considering the similarity in ingredients, it’s not surprising that some women say Monistat performs well as a primer. It’s got the right kind of silicone goodies so if you like the way it works on your skin with your make up, there doesn’t appear to be anything wrong with using it on your face. Especially if it’s cheaper!","Is monistat bikini chafing gel a good makeup primer?","0460613eb71ce65edb12d30d9e929541194b3db9","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2006/04/is-monistat-bikini-chafing-gel-a-good-makeup-primer/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Beauty Armor – How to read an ingredient list by The Beauty Brains Many times you will see us refer to a product’s ingredient statement. In the business it’s called an LOI or List of Ingredients. To arm you with all the knowledge we can, we thought it would be useful to tell you a little bit about these LOIs and how you might read them. In the United States, cosmetic manufacturers are compelled by the governing industry trade organization known as the Cosmetic, Toiletry and Fragrance Association or CTFA to include a list of ingredients on their labels. They maintain a book known as the International Cosmetic Ingredient Dictionary and Handbook which the names of nearly all the ingredients used in cosmetic products worldwide. It’s quite a tome that makes groovy bedtime reading. Why have the labels? The labels are required because the industry wants consumers to know exactly what chemicals they are putting on their bodies. This will allow you to make choices as to what chemicals you want to be exposed to. Of course, that assumes you know what any of the chemicals are, which for most consumers is not the case. Fortunately, with the internet you can simply look up chemical names using a search engine to get more information about the compounds. Be careful however, there are plenty of sites loaded with misinformation about perfectly safe chemicals. Compounds like propylene glycol, mineral oil, and sodium lauryl sulfate have been slandered by biased sources all over the internet. Read all things on the internet with a skeptical eye. (Even the stuff you find here at the Beauty Brains ). What does the label mean? When properly written, the labels can provide you with a lot of useful information. In the United States, any chemical above 1% by weight in the formula is required to be listed in order of concentration. Below 1% the order can be anything they like. Typically, preservatives, fragrances, and colors are listed at the end. Let’s look at this Jergens Natural Glow Daily Moisturizer product as an example. Ingredients: Water, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Petrolatum, Mineral Oil, Ceteareth 20, Dimethicone, Glyceryl Dilaurate, Erythrulose, Persea Gratissima Fruit Extract (Avocado), Avena Sativa Meal Extract (Oat), Simmondsia Chinensis Seed Extract (Jojoba), Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Olea Europaea Fruit Oil (Olive), Tocopherol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Stearic Acid, Acrylates/C10 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Citric Acid, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Hydroxide, DMDM Hydantoin, BHT, Fragrance, Caramel, Titanium Dioxide, Mica, Dihydroxyacetone The first ingredient is water which means this formula is mostly water. Based on this Brain’s knowledge of lotions, it is about 80% water. Glycerin is the next most abundant ingredient probably in there at about 5%. The next few ingredients are anywhere from 1-3%. Look at other skin lotions. I bet you find many of the same ingredients listed in the first line. Now, when you get to a “natural” sounding ingredient like Persea Gratissima Fruit Extract you know you’ve dropped below the magic 1% level. This is where manufacturers can start to make things look different. Generally, natural ingredients are so expensive and ineffective that only a very small amount is in there. Most manufacturers like to throw lots of these “feature” ingredients in the formula just so they have something to talk about and to show their formula are different. The truth is the real functional work of the product is done by the ingredients above this 1% line. This isn’t strictly true as there are many ingredients that give quite good benefits below the 1% level, but generally it’s true. The more abundant a material, the more function it will have. Beauty Brain’s Bottom Line Ingredient lists are included on your cosmetics to give you useful information about the products you use everyday. They are put together following specific rules and if you know these, you can learn a lot about a product. The next time you’re thinking of spending $25 on that upscale hair conditioner, compare the ingredient list to the $3 bottle. You might be surprised by the striking similarities.","Beauty Armor – How to read an ingredient list","e6a4b03b6b1cde549280831e9562950be4e81794","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2006/06/beauty-armor-how-to-read-an-ingredient-list/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Are the facial peels you buy in the store effective by The Beauty Brains Lux Likes This Question… I wanted to know about glycolic treatments and Peel Off Masks available in drugstores and beauty counters.

These high power Derm peels use a glycolic acid concentration of 20% while over the counter like Peter Roth only use about 10%. So yes, there is a difference.

"The Beauty Brains","2017-09-10 08:52:00","Should you start your own NYR organic business? by The Beauty Brains Elizabeth asks… Hi! I’m new to this site, but was impressed by the thorough analysis done on other products. My daughter is selling NYR Organic bodycare products and I was wondering if any here have tried it, and would be interested in hearing an analysis from the brains of the group! I’m not a hardcore organic person, but was impressed at how quickly a small 3rd degree burn healed when I used their lavender oil on it, and then I went to a “practice party” that my daughter did, I was able to check out a few more products. As a good mom would, I am scheduled to host a party, but I am more interested in the analysis of the product before I make any kind of investment in it. Left Brain launches: So sorry about the delay in answering, Liz, we are working hard on meeting our deadline for our new Beauty Brains book. But I thought I’d take time out to answer this one since enlightening people to the realities of multi-level marketing (e.g. Arbonne ) is one of my favorite things to do. So, your question is basically….Should you invest in NYR Organic? NYR Organic products I’ve never used NYR Organic products but you can learn a lot about a product by reviewing the ingredient list. It turns out that they use the same ingredients that everyone else uses. In the cosmetic industry, nearly everyone has access to the same ingredients and ingredient suppliers. Bigger companies will sometimes get exclusive deals, but it’s rare that anyone can gain an advantage by the source of their raw materials. NYR Organic is no different. As a quick example, look at their Rose Body Cream You can click the link for the full list but basically the formula is water, emulsifier (glyceryl stearate) and an oil phase (cetearyl alcohol, Lanolin alcohol, Shea butter, etc). It’s probably a fine formula as they no doubt work with some excellent cosmetic chemists . But this formula isn’t any better than something like Burt’s Bees body butter . And at $36 for 5.2 ounces, NYR Organic doesn’t even compare in value to Burt’s Bees product at $13 for 6.6 ounces. Of course, even Burt’s isn’t even as good a value as something like Neutrogena Body Cream at $7.70 for 6 ounces. But the point is, there is nothing about NYR Organic formulas that makes them superior to other, less expensive products you can buy. And if you find the natural / organic story compelling, then Burt’s Bees, JASON, or any of the other host of “natural / organic” products you can buy at regular stores will be a better value. NYR Organic Sales System I do not know any more about this company than what I’ve read on their website. However, from your description of hosting parties and “investing” in the products, it sounds very much like a system of distribution called Network Marketing or Multi-Level Marketing. In this system, they get “consultants” to buy products, sell them to their friends & family, and then try to get the “consultants” to convert their friends into consultants who will then give them a kickback on every sale. The whole system is very much like a pyramid scheme in which no one (except the people who started the company) really makes any significant money. Of course, it’s not an illegal pyramid scheme because product is actually produced and sold. Before you invest any money in this company or any other, be sure to read this information about Multi-level Marketing . And if the guy at Skeptoid doesn’t make you think twice, read what the FTC has to say about Multilevel Marketing . Beauty Brains Bottom line Should you buy into the NYR Organic system and become a consultant? Ultimately, you have to decide this for yourself. But if the reasons are because the products are something special (they aren’t) or that you’ll make a lot of money (you won’t), then you’ll be best served by skipping this “opportunity”. What do you think about multilevel marketing opportunities? Have you joined and made money?

"The Beauty Brains","","A hair removal method that’s safe, effective, and chemical free by The Beauty Brains Yvette asks: I keep hearing about a hair removal method called “threading.” Can you shed some light on this? The Right Brain’s catty reply: Hi Yvette, I’d be glad to answer your question because hair removal is a hot topic for us – one of the Beauty Brains is known for having bushy, caveman style eyebrows. (I won’t mention any names, but Left Brain, you know who you are.) What is threading? There are two basic types of hair removal: depilation and epilation. Depilation only affects the part of the hair that’s above the surface of the skin. Shaving and chemical depilatories work this way. Epilation removes the entire hair, including the part growing beneath the skin so the effect lasts longer. Threading is an epilation process that uses thread to pull out hair from sensitive areas of the face like the lips and eyebrows. (Other types of epilation include tweezing, waxing and sugaring.) The threading method is very popular in Middle East countries as well as India and Pakistan. How does it work? Thread, usually cotton thread, is twisted and rolled along the surface of the skin. As the thread twists it entangles the hairs, pulling them out of the follicle. As with tweezing, it takes about 3 to 8 weeks for the hairs to grow back out. Threading aficionados claim that using a a growth inhibitor, like Emjoi Cream can help even more. We’re skeptical those products really work so let the buyer beware. What are the advantages? It’s supposedly more gentle to the skin, especially facial skin, than waxing or sugaring. That’s because it doesn’t strip the top layer of your skin. It’s also very economical. Really, really, economical. All you need to do is buy thread. If single threading session uses about 12 inches of thread and a typical spool of thread containing 150 yards of thread and costs $1.99, then the cost of a single threading is only about a half a penny. Now that’s a bargain! (Especially when you consider a bottle of Nair costs about $4.00.) Are there any disadvantages? It can be tricky to do on yourself and, like tweezing, it’s tough to cover large surface areas. If you want to epilate your bikini area, you’re better off with a product like Wax-cellance . Have you tried threading? Or do you have another favorite way to remove unwanted hair? Leave a comment and share your secrets with the Beauty Brains community.","A hair removal method that’s safe, effective, and chemical free","24e78141dc24a43af5ed85a04b59e82062eb681b","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2007/11/a-hair-removal-method-thats-safe-effective-and-chemical-free/"
"The Beauty Brains","2015-12-02 14:26:00","The best way to get chlorine out of your hair by The Beauty Brains Kerry`s question: I swim 3-4 times a week and use Ultra Swim Chlorine Removal Shampoo and Pantene conditioner. I’m wondering if the shampoo is actually getting rid of the chlorine or just stripping it of any oils since my hair always feels almost “squeaky clean” after using it. The Right Brain Responds: First of all, we should point out that any good deep cleaning or clarifying shampoo will get rid of surface oils and make your hair feel squeaky clean. That`s to be expected but it`s not really related to how well it removes chlorine. Does Ultra Swim do anything special to get rid of chlorine? Not really. It does contain a chemical called sodium thiosulfate that can THEORETICALLY react with chlorine, but we`re not aware of any practical evidence to show that really works. If you`re curious, check out this article for an excellent summary of the chemistry of chlorine on hair . Although the author makes a few inaccurate statements about shampoo ingredients, it is a nice summary of the chemical interaction of chlorine and sodium thiosulfate. Chlorine can do nasty things to your hair – it can bleach your color and it can leave a residual odor. But once it`s in your hair the damage is mostly done. Basically, you just have to keep washing your hair until the chlorine is gone. The best way to get chlorine out of your hair is stop it from getting in there in the first place! Use a good silicone conditioner BEFORE exposing your hair to chlorinated pool water. That will prevent your hair from absorbing so much chlorine and will mitigate the nasty side effects.","The best way to get chlorine out of your hair","d587922810b6ade6f095609f3ce0e6d4b8970786","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2007/03/the-best-way-to-get-chlorine-out-of-your-hair/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Can a common household product cure nail fungus? by The Beauty Brains Tailfeather from the forum want to let us know: If you have a nail fungus, Vick’s Vapor Rub can be used as a simple home remedy instead of Lamasil . She points out that it’s cheaper and doesn’t have dangerous side effects. The Right Brain comments: You can read Tailfeather’s entire discussion in the Forum , but she raised some interesting points that are worthy of mention here in the blog. What is a nail fungus? First of all, let’s explain that a nail fungus is type of microbial infection that can cause your nail to become discolored. As Tail puts it, she noticed some “weird yellow stuff” on her big toenail. As the fungus spreads the infected nail can become thickened, distorted in shape, and develop crumbling edges. Fungi can infect your feet whey they’re exposed to dark, damp conditions and they can be very difficult to control. Is Lamasil dangerous? There are several fungus fighting drugs available, both prescription and over the counter. One of the most popular is Lamasil and it’s true that it has some not so pleasant side effects . The two that Tailfeather mentioned are temporary lost of taste and the slight (but serious) danger of liver damage. If this risk concerns you, then Lamasil is probably not for you. Does Vicks really fight fungus? Vick’s Vapor Rub is a popular ointment that contains a variety of aromatic oils. It’s designed to help soothe your upper respiratory tract during a cold. Tailfeather claims it cured her toe nail fungus. Is that possible? Looking at the ingredients we see that one of the oils used in the product is thymol. We found a Pubmed reference to a paper on thymol published in the Journal of Phytotherapy Research. According to this paper and we quote: “The oil exhibited a strong inhibitory effect against all fungi investigated.” Based on this research it certainly seems plausible that Vick’s could work as an antifungal. Unfortunately, P&G, the company that makes Vicks can’t legally claim this effect without presenting test data to the FDA. So you’re not likely to see anything official from Vick’s. Lamasil is proven to work, Vick’s is not, but if you’re interested give it a try.","Can a common household product cure nail fungus?","6462ce55ed82f5d470cce039fb4b9f1e18e04fe9","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2007/09/can-a-common-household-product-cure-nail-fungus/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Fructis fortifying cream conditioner by The Beauty Brains Let’s take a look at Garnier’s Fructis Fortifying Cream Conditioner . This product is appropriately positioned for “normal” hair, in other words, hair that doesn’t need intensive conditioning. (That means you don’t color or highlight or any other kind of chemical processing!) So, if you need a moderate level of conditioning and you like bright fruity fragrances, then you should give it a try. The most interesting aspect of the product is its claim about Active Fruit Concentrate. The back of the bottle states that the concentrate is “the innovative combination of ingredients naturally present in fruit: fruit acids, vitamins B3 and B6, Fructose and Glucose.” Here’s where The Beauty Brains reality lesson kicks in: there is no scientific data to show that these fruit ingredients do ANYTHING for your hair. Now, that’s not to say that this isn’t a fine formula. In fact, it uses some rather sophisticated conditioning agents, like behenitrimonium chloride. (That might sound scary, but it’s actually good for your hair!) Anyway, the effect on your hair comes from this kind of ingredient NOT from the Active Fruit Concentrate. Most companies play this game to some degree – they add ingredients to a formula that give the product a sexy, hip image. There’s nothing wrong with that! That’s what Marketing is all about – BUT they do have to be careful to present it in a way that’s not misleading to the consumer. So, congrats to Garnier (which by the way is a division of L’Oreal) for developing a great smelling, solid performing formula – but shame on them for not being a little more careful with their claims. PS: Garnier takes a very “science-y” approach with this brand – they even include some pictures and graphs on the back of the bottle to show how it works. Some other time we’ll talk about how they support their strength and shine claims.

Are there any dangers with this? The Right Brain Righteously Replies: Yes, applying eyeliner (or other eye makeup ) inside your eyelids can be dangerous! Why? Because improper application of eye make up can damage the cornea (the clear front surface of the eye). An eyeliner wand can scratch the cornea and make it susceptible to infection from the bacteria that eye cosmetics can carry . Is it serious? Yes, we’re talking potential blindness here.

"The Beauty Brains","","Why does shampoo stop working after awhile? by The Beauty Brains Tammy’s request… It seems I have to change my shampoo all the time because my hair gets used to it. Why is this? The Right Brain Responds: A lot of people complain that their shampoo “stops working” or that their hair “gets immune” to it and they have to change. Hair care researchers have looked into this question but have never been able to find any solid scientific reason that this should happen. But, as usual, we have a theory: Shampoo burnout? Many shampoos contain some level of condtioning agents. Back in the day, unless your shampoo was a “2-in-1″, it was not generally capable of depositing any conditioning ingredients on your hair. But today, that the 2 in 1 (shampoo plus conditioner) technology has found its way into moisturizing shampoos, color care shampoos, and even some volumizing shampoos. You might find ingredients like silicones, cationic guar gum, and conditioning polymers in almost any shampoo today. So, although you may not realize it, you may be using a shampoo that provides as much, or almost as much, conditioning as a 2 in 1. Let’s say that you use this kind of shampoo for a while. You might feel that your hair gets over conditioned after a while. So, you decide to change shampoos. Maybe you start to use a clarifying or deep cleansing shampoo. For a while everything is fine – your hair feels nice and clean again. All the ingredients that built up on your hair from the 2 in 1 shampoos get removed. But then, after using that stripping shampoo for a while, your hair starts to feel dry like straw. So, you feel the need to switch shampoos again. You pick up a “balancing” shampoo that contains some conditioning ingredients. And after using this one for a while you start to feel buildup and the whole cycle starts all over again. This kind of process could be the cause of “shampoo burnout.” Of course, this is only a theory, but it is a theory that makes sense when you consider how modern shampoo formulations work. Kerastase concern The good people at Kerastase have a different theory, however. We quote: No, it isn’t true that shampoos don’t work after some time, Karen Ong, brand manager for Kerastase and Redken, says. Like skin, hair and scalp conditions change due to internal and external aggressions such as hormonal levels, diet, sleep and pollution, and need different solutions. That`s why it feels like the shampoo doesn’t work anymore because your needs have changed. We seriously doubt that diet, sleep or pollution significantly impact shampoo performance.

"The Beauty Brains","","Do you want photoshop free beauty ads? by The Beauty Brains Scatter Brain says: Beware the Art Director With a Photoshop Program As long as there have been photographs, there has been photo manipulation. It’s interesting, because this art form came about to capture reality, but as soon as we figured out how, we started altering that reality. For instance, I have a baby picture of my Dad, taken at a portrait studio over 7 decades ago. My sweet chubby baby Daddy has rosy cheeks that are hand tinted and the lushest painted on eyelashes that ever adorned a baby’s face. He even appears to be wearing just the slightest hint of lip color. Hand tinted of course. Later came airbrushing and composite photos. When I worked at the advertising agency in Atlanta (I’m not telling how many decades ago) there was big dust up over the fact that TV Guide used a “photo” of Oprah on the magazine cover that was Oprah’s head on Ann Margaret’s body. This composite caused a bit of outrage, but the technology was already “out of the bag” so to speak and after that we used it often to make funny birthday cards for colleagues and other such hilarity. I remember distinctly one composite of my boss’s head on Queen Elizabeth’s body as she sat on her royal throne. It was very fitting. Faux photos Now we have Photoshop, which allows multiple ways to manipulate photographs, and when we look at advertising images it’s hard to know what is real and what is the product of a skilled art director or photo retoucher. Do the models in cosmetic ads really have blemish free skin, no wrinkles, no cellulite, no bumps, lumps, spider veins, varicose veins or moles? (Except Cindy Crawford’s famous mole of course) In fact, it almost seems a sure bet that the images are not real which is really a shame because it adds to the “unbelievable factor” already inherent in many cosmetics ads. The newest thing I’ve observed (which frankly causes me to laugh uncontrollably) are these popup internet ads with the roll over feature that shows a woman’s face before using the miracle firming skin cream, age reducer, wrinkle reducer etc. As you roll your cursor over her face she amazingly becomes MANY years younger. I often wonder what art director thinks this is believable. Seriously, the change is so dramatic, the model goes from looking like Baba Yaga the hag from Russian folklore to Barbie-like perfection. The Beauty Brains bottom line Sadly, when a photo has been so obviously manipulated it makes me wonder why. My thought is the product must not work that well or the visible results would not have to be so blatantly faked. What do YOU think? Does it bother you that you can’t believe your eyes anymore?

"The Beauty Brains","","Is the no-poo method for you? by The Beauty Brains Indi-Curl wonders… I have just started a No-Poo hair care routine for my ultra-curly hair and I have a question about leave-in products that are compatible with the system. I know to avoid silicone, and I do, but I was wondering about products with Mineral oil in them. My favorite leave-in treatment contains Mineral oil. Is a conditioner like VO5 strong enough to cleanse hair when this type product is used? I couldn’t find any real information online about it. Everyone just says not to use Mineral oil at all, but it works great on my hair! My hair has never looked better, but I want to make sure I don’t have any buildup problems down the road. Thanks! Left Brain explains For the people who don’t know it, the No-Poo hair care routine is basically washing your hair with conditioner instead of shampoo. People also call it Co-washing as in Conditioner Washing. Some say it originated with a stylist in Australia but it’s tough to know where these things actually start. The reason people do it is because they want to avoid the harsh effects of shampoo surfactants on their hair. Another strategy is to use Dry Shampoo but we’ll save that for another post. How can conditioner wash hair? There is some science and logic behind this hair care regime. Shampoos are typically composed of about 10-15% detergent. They use anionic surfactants like Sodium Laureth Sulfate of Ammonium Lauryl Sulfate which do an excellent job of cleaning and removing oil from hair. Conditioners also have detergents in them but a different kind. They use cationic surfactants (or quats) which have the tendency to stick to the hair where they provide conditioning. Common ingredients are Cetrimonium Chloride or Distearyldimonium Chloride and are used at 1-5%. Although they do stick to the hair, these ingredients also have the ability to cleanse the hair. This is why the No-Poo washing system can work. Avoid Mineral Oil? The reason people say to avoid silicones and mineral oil is because the amount of detergent used in conditioners may not be enough. This may or may not be true. It really depends on your hair and the way it is left feeling to you. The VO5 conditioner should be enough to remove mineral oil, but you have to try it to know for sure. It may even be good enough to remove silicone! If you are unsatisfied with the way your hair feels after trying the No-Poo method, you should consider occasionally washing your hair or trying a VO5 Hot Oil treatment. I know this might sound odd, but the Hot Oil treatment does not actually have oil in it! It is composed of a quat (like the VO5 conditioner) called Cocotrimonium Chloride. You can use this product and it will give your hair a good cleaning without using the harsh surfactants of shampoo. It even foams. Beauty Brains bottom line There is no scientific reason to avoid using Mineral Oil or Silicone if you are using the No-poo method of cleansing. It just depends on whether you like the way your hair feels or not. No-poo or Co-washing is not for everyone, but some people like the way it makes their hair feel. It will be less damaging, less exposure to chemicals, and may even do a better job of protecting your hair color & shape. However, I doubt the shampoo companies are too worried about everyone switching. While it may be less damaging, it also leaves your hair feeling a bit “dirty”…and it is.

So my question is does black nail polish really ruin your nails? Sarah Bellum responds: Natasha, I’m sorry to hear about your problem at school. The Beauty Brains would never question the authority of your principal, but what about the science behind his decision? That’s another story! Yellow nails It’s true that wearing dark shades of nail polish can stain your nails yellow. (Been there, done that!) That’s because there’s a reaction between the colorant and your nails. (The Left and Right Brains blogged about this before – go read their post on yellow nails .) But even if you do stain your nails, they’ll return to their normal color when they grow out. Other than the staining issue, I’m not aware of any other problems caused by black nail polish. Also, I believe that other dark colors can cause staining, so it’s not just about black. Fashion sense or science? Here’s what I don’t get: if the Principal is so concerned about nail health, why not ban all dark nail colors? Heck, why not ban acrylic nails ? They can create problems too! Or, tell students they can’t get pedicures because they can cause infections . Why stop at black nails if health is really the issue here? Could it be that there’s another reason for the his decision? Could this be more related to school dress code than science? Hmmmmm.

"The Beauty Brains","","Don’t make this dangerous mistake when washing your face by The Beauty Brains Jennifer has a question about using facial cleansers as moisturizers. I’ve heard a dermatologist say to use Aquanil to cleanse and to moisturize any dry patches. I use a product called Cerave as a cleanser and I’m wondering if it’s okay to use that as a moisturizer? I’m worried that using a cleanser/detergent on my face might irritate it or cause redness.” The Left Brain responds : I totally agree with you Jen – it doesn’t make sense to leave ANY detergent-containing product on the skin as a moisturizer. Especially one like Aquanil that contains Sodium Lauryl Sulfate . The Cerave product looks like it would be a pretty mild cleanser because it doesn’t contain any of the standard harsh detergents, but some of those ingredients could be irritating too if left in contact with your skin. You’re better off finding a mild lotion and using that to moisturize or using a product like Clarisonic to clean your face. What’s most puzzling to me is this: why would any dermatologist recommend using a detergent-containing product as a moisturizer when there are so many excellent facial lotions on the market? Has anyone else in the Beauty Brains community heard this recommendation? Have you tried the Clarisonic system?","Don’t make this dangerous mistake when washing your face","ee0acef275a97e9a67fdcb19061c5ef236e9e853","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2007/03/dont-make-this-dangerous-mistake-when-washing-your-face/"
"The Beauty Brains","2015-07-11 16:53:00","How your extra skin can save lives by The Beauty Brains Shelly says: Your post about donating hair to Locks of Love reminded me of this article about donating extra skin. Can this be for real? The Left Brain responds: It’s true. Researchers have figured out a way to “recycle” excess skin from weight loss operations into usable grafts to help with a number surgical procedures. Since the supply of skin from recently deceased donors isn’t enough to fill the surgical demand, the Musculoskeletal Transplant Foundation, the nations largest tissue bank, is now working with almost 70 surgeons around the country on a new living skin donation program. How does living skin donation work? When you’re having a tummy tuck or any other procedure that involves skin removal, you can chose to donate the skin for surgical use. After the skin is removed from your body, it’s prepared for its new home. First it must be stripped of fat; even though you may have lot of weight your skin can still contain excess fat. Then, other cells must be removed to prevent the recipient from rejecting the new tissue, as frequently occurs in organ transplants. The remaining slabs of skin are known as a collagen matrix. These slabs are then cut and shaped into pieces that can be used in surgical procedures. The final pieces are packaged, frozen, and stored for distribution. Once the harvested skin reaches the hospital, it is implanted in its new body so the collagen matrix can act as a scaffolding that the patients’ bodies use to regrow skin of their own. What is living skin used for? Living skin donations can be used for a variety of procedures, like reconstructing breasts after mastectomy, repairing abdominal walls from hernias, building bladder slings to control incontinence, and reshaping facial features damaged by cancer. Researchers are still learning how to use living skin in place of cadaver skin. Cadaver skin is better for treating burn victims because it’s easier to shave off thin sheets of skin when it’s still attached to the body. Living skin requires new tools and new procedures that are still being developed. So if you’re going ahead with that tummy tuck because you’re not satisfied with the weight loss from that new diet pill Alli , you might want to consider living skin donation.

"admin","","Should you say yes to carrots by admin Paulaboub is perplexed… I recently came across a new ( to me) product line called Yes To Carrots. It lists mostly natural ingredients. I bought the moisturizing day cream and shower gel/body wash. Smells nice, the cream doesn’t bother my eyes as alot of creams do these days. Just wondering what you thought. The Left Brain doesn’t care for carrots: If you like Yes To Carrots because it smells nice and it doesn’t irritate your eyes, then then by all means you should buy it. But if you’re asking my professional opinion, I have to tell you that I’m not very impressed by this faux natural brand. Yes To Carrots? According to their website: All of our Yes To products combine the fresh, unadulterated goodness of organic fruits and vegetables with the purifying and moisturizing properties of 26 minerals harvested from the ancient world’s most renowned spa- the Dead Sea. Come on! While it’s true that their formulas contain lots of natural goodies, they don’t bother to mention that the functional ingredients in their products are the same tried and true chemicals used in other mass market beauty products. For example, their shower gel is based on sodium coceth sulfate (a cleanser) and cocamide DEA (a foam booster/thickener). While I have no problem with brands that like to convey a certain look, feel, and scent by using natural ingredients, I don’t like being mislead to by companies that claim to use the “unadulterated goodness of organic fruits and vegetables” but don’t tell you they include chemicals like propanediol and benzyl alcohol in their formulations. Perilous Parabens? Another issue I have with this brand is their stance on parabens. Their website also gives an explanation for why their products are paraben-free. Parabens are a group of chemicals that have been widely used as preservatives in many cosmetics to ensure the products remain free of bacteria, fungus and other microbes. They also help extend the shelf life of cosmetic products. In 1998, the United States Environmental Protection Agency released a report stating that parabens – butyl, ethyl, methyl and propyl varieties – demonstrated “estrogenic activity.” Sounds like a mouthful, but it means that these chemicals could possibly imitate hormones found in the human body and have an adverse effect on our endocrine system when absorbed by the skin or flushed into our drinking supply. Studies conducted in Europe found similar results and we’ve found better alternatives to ensure your products stay clean while ensuring your safety when using Yes To Carrots TM products. The problem is, this is only half truth because subsequent studies have shown that the methyl and propyl parabens have no cause for concern. (You can read the details about parabens here .) The Beauty Brains bottom line In my opinion, Yes To Carrots is just another brand trying to capitalize on the naturals/organics trend by hiding standard cosmetics ingredients behind an over-hyped soup of fruit and vegetable extracts. The products may work perfectly fine but, personally, that kind of hypocrisy turns me off. For those of who to chose to disregard our advice, you can buy Yes To Carrots here. Left Brain February 24, 2009 at 7:00 pm @Sarah Bellum and @Mid Brain: Could you two please knock it off. This is supposed to be a beauty science blog, not a forum for your gripes. (Besides, I thought the picture was funny…) Christina March 3, 2009 at 8:22 pm Hi, I would just like to say that I’ve been using Yes To Carrots products and I must say I absolutely LOVE their products. As for parabens, with everything I read on them I rather completly eliminate them from my beauty products. I do not think that Yes to Carrots is trying to capitalize on the naturals/organics trend but I do believe that they are offering great, affordable, paraben and cruelty free products which DOES include organic fruit and vegetables! I do say Yes to Carrots! pagooma March 7, 2009 at 4:41 pm This site could not be more a.) refreshing and b.) hilarious. Finally a real place where the ludicras hype about beauty products is wiped away and real science and chemistry is exposed…especially by you, Lefty. I never cease to be amazed by the fear of “chemicals”…aaaaahhhh so prevelent out there! What do they think everything is made of, anyway?!? Especially thanks for the humor!! Oh and, nice carrot. Left Brain March 8, 2009 at 12:56 am Thanks, @pagooma! It’s comments from people like you that make working on this blog seem worthwhile. I really appreciate you taking the time to write back us. Sandra April 14, 2009 at 12:37 pm Hi, I totally agree with Christina regarding sayyestocarrots…I cant believe how good it works…I bought one product, then another, then another, then another…I am an ingredient reading fanatic so I appreciate when there are as little of the “bad” ingredients as possible. I totally love sayyestocarrots and i just bought yestocucumbers shampoo and conditioner…LOVE IT LOVE IT!! Jenny May 10, 2009 at 10:16 pm I am sorry but your stand on parabens doesn’t make much sense. It has been proven that they are indeed toxic. Following any logic, you would want to use products that are as natural as possible. The nature didn’t intend for people to put parabens on the skin( as you may know skin absorbs a large portion of what you put on it). You pay a lot of attention on the brand’s image and portraying, etc. I would try and review products based on their effectiveness and their ingredients; not what pisses you off and what doesn’t about the company image. Jenny May 10, 2009 at 10:19 pm Pagooma, do high levels of cancer in our society amaze you? If they do, you should seriously stop being amazed at the “fear of chemicals”. Critical thinking never hurts. Audrey June 3, 2009 at 10:27 pm MY turn: I have cork-screw red hair, the kind that gets easily tangled and looks usually dry. Also, I’m 38 years-old, fair skin (yet I grew in the tropics) plus all factors that consume the beauty such as bad nutrition, pollution, etc. The thing is: these products DO change my hair and skin’s aspect. The skin feels soooo smooth as you just wash your face in the morning! And for some reason the day creams give you so much hydration that you feel great even without make-up. My curls got more definition but bouncier, framing my face the way I like it to be. Even my husband have noticed (?!) so I suggest you all a try : ) I am buying it for my daughter and best friends. All products on the market try to hook you by selling some cool concept. Even if the chemicals in the formula reveal that they are not as green as they want me to believe… Yes To Carrots works. I only hope they don’t change it. De Marie June 10, 2009 at 8:31 pm I bought the Yes To Carrots face moisturizer and I think it smells like strong old-style (old lady) perfume – not what I want on my face. It almost gagged me. I’m going to try to return it to the store. Coconut oil is the only way! Jess August 2, 2009 at 8:56 am I bought the ‘Yes to Carrots’ Shampoo & Conditioner and loved the products.It was inexpensive, worked well and most importantly did not test on animals (those three things combined are very hard to find in haircare) Personally I don’t see how advertising that the product contains fruit/vege extracts is leading people to believe it is an organic/all natural product. Consumers are more educated these days. Becky August 2, 2009 at 5:07 pm Yes to Carrots Body Butter is amazing. I have not tried anything of their other products but this stuff makes your skin beautiful!! Jess September 28, 2009 at 6:30 pm Thank you for opening my eyes to this company! And thanks for doing the hard work I neglected to do. Cheers for you. Spicey November 2, 2009 at 6:59 pm oh my gawh, that pix of duh carrot luks lyk my gram-mawh wen she wears hr bikini! chickablue November 11, 2009 at 3:56 pm Their hand and elbow cream rocks!! I like their shower gel but it does suck that it has the sodium lauryl sulfate since that irritates my skin a bit. I think they try their best to use some of God’s natural stuff. Hopefully they will strive to go higher without compromising their reasonable prices. I will keep purchasing their hand cream. joann clark November 28, 2009 at 11:20 am i recentley tried the hand and elbow lotion at a friends house and loved the feel and the fragrance is beautiful so i bought some right away. within 24 hrs my hands feel so much better . they were extremley dry and splitting. although its really a higher price than what i usually spend on lotion as i am on a limited income,i dont mind if im really going to see improvement with it. i will use this tube and then decide but i have a feeling im going top permentley use it. again –it smells beautiful. sincerely , joann clark jw January 1, 2010 at 2:12 pm Love the hand and elbow cream too! I have had this this layer of dryer skin on my face where the lower layer has had a hard time getting to the surface. It now has remolded the skin and fine lines are gone. Since carrots are retin A, this formula takes the place of made retin A w/o ANY burning concern. What a formula!!!!! My face is really smooth and am also now watching my 11′s getting shorter and flatter. I am at home and keep it gooped all over my face and it is healing very well. All wrinkles are only a layer of damaged skin. Work w/that and you will see. No other creams do this like the expensive ones. This is an amazing find, I’m sure I’ll use it for life. The body wash made my ankles itch really bad though. I also started taking gota cola and siberian ginsing. I know this and w/o the help of this cream would I be getting my skin back. Hooray! jw January 1, 2010 at 2:14 pm Just a note that I am talking about the hand and elbow cream as my face cream. LeAnna January 21, 2010 at 6:30 pm Found this on google while looking up reviews on more yestocarrots product reviews. I have naturally dry skin (thumbs and fingertips almost get calluses regularly from just every day mundane stuff) and tried out their hand and elbow one figuring, nothing to lose- I’ve tried tons of stuff with no success so still looking for my “holy grail”. My hands have gotten so much softer- the rough skin is diminishing after 2 weeks of use. For the price (about $10) I’m willing to invest that regularly to have something that makes my hands feel human! I bought their eye cream because the skin above my eye lid was getting flaky and coarse. It burnt at first when I put it on (my other eye creams had too though, the skin was so dry) It’s been 2 nights and a noticeable difference- my lids don’t feel tight at the end of the day. I want to try their face cream next and see how it goes. I like the idea they’re trying to use mostly natural ingredients, I like being able to know exactly what an ingredient is (though it’s not a requirement in my products, just a nice feature). I think I’ll start reading this blog more as it seems to have a lot of beauty answers you can’t find anywhere else!! Janice Beno. February 27, 2010 at 10:08 am I am disappointed to read fragance listed on ing. list before carrot seed oil. A March 7, 2010 at 5:52 pm What’s this “natural is always best” crap? You know what else is natural? Botulism, cyanide, arsenic, anthrax…just to name a few. Sarah March 26, 2010 at 2:03 pm Gotta say I’m a huge fan of Y2C. I bought their shampoo because it was paraben free and it’s the best shampoo I’ve ever used. My hair feels light and clean and doesn’t feel like it’s filled with heavy synthetic moisturizer. I noticed a difference right away. Other than eliminating shampoo completely, I’d say this is the next best thing. perspex April 7, 2010 at 9:16 am Just curious if Audrey, Jenny and Becky are the same people? All had distinctly similar grammatical mistakes. It’s a poor argument that nature doesn’t want us to put parabens on our skin. Guess what nature ‘wants’ us to put on our skin? Nothing. There is nothing natural about any skincare. We are not ‘meant’ to put anything on our skin. But like a lot of ‘unnatural’ interventions, skincare brings improvement. Foolishly, in my younger years, I was a purist about ‘all natural’ products. However, I never spouted such outlandish stuff as the defenders of natural/organic products do in their comments here. Once, I was naive enough to believe the information from the natural cosmetic companies (before I realised how much of the information is simply made up and has no source at all), but I still questioned some of what they said if it didn’t gel with my common sense. It was a questioning mind that led me to believe and a questioning mind that led me out. That’s what I wish some people would understand who think we just haven’t ‘woken up’ if we don’t think parabens or mineral oil are evil. I’ve actually been a true believer in natural/organic but kept questioning and came to a much more moderate point of view. The dogma surrounding ‘natural’ in cosmetics and other products is extremely rigid. I don’t think subscribing to it and regurgitating the exact same points as every other follower makes you a critical thinker. I still believe in a lot of plant-based ingredients and their benefits, and tend to find, for whatever reason, they work best for my skin. But I find most natural cosmetics companies formulate really poorly, which is why I often make my own. Just today, I was trying to see if I could find a basic jojoba moisturizer with nothing comedogenic in it, and was amazed to find a natural brand telling me how great jojoba was because it wasn’t technically an oil and therefore won’t clog pores or feel greasy – while their formula contained 3 other plant oils as major ingredients, at least one that is majorly comedogenic. Another organic blemish treatment I came across has coconut oil in it, one of the most comedogenic ingredients around. So no, I will not use things that are ‘natural’ when those formulating have no idea what they are doing and don’t care to learn, because to them it is enough benefit for something to be ‘natural’. My point is, while I still love a lot of plant-based ingredients and love formulating my own things with them, I feel incredibly relieved to no longer be afraid of synthetic ingredients and therefore not having some very effective, helpful products off limits. My Paula’s Choice cleanser and toner keep my skin clearer and softer than it’s ever been and I haven’t had to stop using them after a few uses due to irritation like most products, including most ‘natural’ products (and even other Paula products). And it’s just GOOD to have removed an unnecessary stress from my life: fearing things based on misinformation claiming harmless things are actually harmful. I just think that sort of thing is bad psychologically, and it is partly reflection on this effect on my psychological well-being that made me reconsider the purist approach. Another thing I never understand is why the natural ingredient devotees say of things like parabens that “they may not definitely be harmful, but isn’t it better to be safe and avoid them?” even after the original work showing potential harm has been discredited or potential links to cancer etc disproven. So on what basis should we avoid them? The only reason to believe that is because of the bias that it’s likely to be harmful because it’s synthetic. Never mind that this logic of avoiding until proven safe could apply to a lot of natural ingredients that don’t have any safety studies done,. Why not avoid them till we have conclusive safety studies? And don’t give me “because time has proven them safe”, whilst ignoring that could also apply to parabens and mineral oil. If I ever sell the products I make, though there would be many ‘natural’ ingredients, I would certainly preserve them with parabens because I think it’s the responsible thing to do – to protect against the known threat of a potentially very serious infection, and to use the most safe preservatives to do so. I have used GSE in my home formulations but I would be uncomfortable selling something with that in it. Though there was that one study that showed it was only effective when contaminated with other preservatives, I admit I think it’s possible the manufacturer’s side is true, that the effective compound is very similar and thus triggers a false positive. BUT the facts remain: its safety has not been studied, and it can not reasonably be considered a natural product anyway. So why do natural companies shun one artificial preservative, with no proven safety, for another with proven safety? It’s baffling. I suppose it is the power of semantics, one being called the natural-sounding ‘grapefruit seed extract’. I feel that those who bash this blog have a poor understanding of and appreciation for science. Their view of it is far too conspiratorial, and even anti-intellectual. I think it is fine to apply critical thinking to bodies of knowledge and be aware of the politics that often governs information. But dismissing science altogether OR showing little interest in understanding how it works or its findings is … well, too willfully ignorant at best, and hateful at worst. I think we have to have an appreciation for experts in any field, be it cosmetic chemists, art historians, or electricians. It takes a lot of work to really get a grip on all the ins and outs of a particular, specialised area of knowledge. The hard part is that if it is not our own area of knowledge, we have to trust those whose it is, and I think some people really struggle with that. I don’t think we should have blind trust, but the amount of distrust many science bashers display is unreasonable and a huge overreaction. I think many people want to believe they can become instant experts, and they read a few articles and believe they are. The articles appeal not only because of confirmation bias, but because they push a lot of emotional buttons and therefore are far more interesting to the average reader than the dull, dry stuff real experts have to pore over! Not only this, but misinformation is often simplistic and conceptual, and therefore more accessible than real information. Many times, I’ve heard/read someone say ‘oh that makes sense!’ to a pseudo-scientific explanation simply because it gels with a certain metaphoric sense they have of how/why things should work. For example, I recently read someone claim poor digestion makes you fat because it stays in your stomach and turns to fat. It’s as if they only had a childish sense of filling the body up like a vessel, and weighing it down and not even a rudimentary sense of what a digestive system does. I have a great respect for those who do the plodding work that leads to an accurate, improved body of knowledge. The bashers are not interested in understanding that’s what it takes for someone to truly have expert knowledge on a subject and I find their lack of respect for the good individuals making a difference every day, appalling. FriendofFoliage April 15, 2010 at 2:56 pm I just bought the Y2C shampoo and am glad to get some varied perspective on the company. I’ve become pretty desensitized to the “natural” label, mostly because I work in agriculture so I know exactly what to look for when I want something w/ no GMOs and whatnot. I actually wanted the Y2Cucumbers, but my bff is very allergic and I was worried my dandruff might send her into a coma. A big selling point to me w/ this company is their seed bank project to help start community gardens, presence of some organic compounds, and no animal testing. Their site shows they have 501c3 status which means they are a legit non-profit in that part of the company. I find Y2C is very good for my hair care because I switch off between salon products like Redkin-which make your hair gorgeous but do have chemicals that can bioremediate in your cells-and various organic products which I feel give my hair a bit of a break from intensive moisture. Left Brain, have you ever heard of Boscia? I haven’t found any reviews on this site but would like to hear your opinion. They’re another natural company from Japan. I’ve tried 4 products (daily moisturizer, night creme, “chapstick,” and facial cleanser) and all but the chapstick have blown my epidermal perspective. Also, if you like that carrot pic, you’ll love some penis peppers! I lol’d so much the first time I saw them–a vendor sells them at our farmers’ market. Sarah April 26, 2010 at 10:02 pm Has anyone noticed if the Y2C Daily Moisturizer has changed in texture and fragrance? I bought two jars from two different stores and they had both changed. It was a little more grainy and the smell wasn’t as fresh. I can’t find it anywhere if they changed the recipe. poop May 15, 2010 at 6:08 am Lefty… You are a loser! Get a life. Go get a girlfriend or something. Just stop hanging out here! And Perspex… is your life that dull that you have time in your day to write a book here? I read the first 2 sentences of your manifesto and thought… LOSER!!! Do yourselves all a favor and go find hobbies… its not too late. You can un loser yourselves… just stop hanging around waiting to hear what Lefty is gonna say next! You all have issues! poop May 15, 2010 at 6:13 am oh yeah… and Lefty.. could you please tell me if the YesTo line is biodegradable? ShanShan August 16, 2010 at 2:55 pm Thanks for the info. I actually agree with Perspex about all-natural vs science. I am by no means an expert but I used to stress-out over being all-natural and tried to not use synthetics. But that didn’t last long cause my skin and hair suffered due to bad formulations. I now personally stay away from pore-clogging ingredients in both hair and face/body products, and sulfates and silicones in hair products. I wouldn’t mind trying Y2C but their products contain pore-clogging ingredients like Isopropyl Myristate, Sweet Almond Oil, Isopropyl Palmitate, etc. And their shampoo and conditioner contains sulfates and silicones. So it’s a ‘no 2 carrots’ for me but only because of my refusal to use certain ingredients. And Poop it seems like you are the one with too much time on your hands. jen September 8, 2010 at 10:21 am I’ve been using Y2C for a few months now. I’ve been looking for something a little more natural than proactiv which I had been using for a year, and ruined my skin. Y2C was a nice change. The smell was different but tolerable(almost like baby wash). It felt good to use something better. My intentions are to use this product temporarily until I find the ultimate product. At first I felt good about using ingredients from the earth, which have been used for centuries, and appherently worked quite well throughout the world. Times have changed though, and as much as I wanted to believe I was using something extraordinary, I knew that Y2C was no different than any other company in a capitalist society. I bought y2c the other day because I was running out. The Yes to Carrots company has now paid far less attention on their ingredients, and has heavily emphasized their marketing techniques. The product has gotten thinner(almost water-like), their name on the product itself has gotten a bigger font, and their ingredient label has gotten, well, less natural. I’m glad they quit lying. kuddos2lefty sammy September 24, 2010 at 2:33 pm hi everyone i am currently useing say yes to cucombers facial cleanser and i follow that with the cucombers moisterizer and the eye cream and i love it love it the eye cream is amazin its made with green tea so it firms eyes and brightens too its like no other there skin line is wonderful i have very sensitive skin and i have try many things for my skin and alot of reactions from all those harsh things they put in some skin care products not good for us so bottom line i love say yes to cucombers skincare sammy October 11, 2010 at 12:07 pm hello everyone i was wondering if anyone has tryed the say yes to carrots body wash iv heard many good things about it so im asking for any advice on this so feel free to answer back thanku fawn October 20, 2010 at 2:18 pm I absolutely LOVE Y2C PRODUCTS. I started off using a travel carrot body butter,,I loved it so much I bought the full size jar and use it religiously. I have sensitive skin and almost always break out from products,,especially after “shaving”. The body butter has been a MIRACLE, , NO RASH,, JUST SILKY SMOOTH SKIN.. I recently bought the yes to tomato face wash and so far I am loving that also… The cucumber eye gel is FANTASTIC, , FEELS GREAT,,and brightens my eyes. I will be trying more products very soon. yaaaaa October 24, 2010 at 11:32 pm the bottle actually says 99% natural or organic or whatever. They are telling the truth. If it said 100% I’d be disappointed. There are very very little chemicals compared to organic ingredients in the products. Jenny November 3, 2010 at 2:54 pm perspex, no I am not Becky and not Audrey. I am not sure what grammatical errors you noticed in my earlier posts and how they are similar to other peoples’ errors, but this is not relevant to this discussion. As for your super long post. Lady, parabens haven BEEN proven in a lab to mimic estrogen and cause cancer. In fact, doctors advise cancer patients NOT to use ANY products containing parabens. So your long post telling everyone how you realized that you don’t need to be afraid of synthetic ingredients anymore is misinformed at best. Nature may not have intended to put anything on your skin, but if it did, the lest intended would be petroleum derived, paraben laden concoction sold by majority of drug store and luxury brands. Paula’s Choice is just another mass produced full of chemicals line containing SLS, petroleum based compounds, parabens, and other things no one should be putting on their skin. Paula’s so called research is biased simply because she has her own cosmetics line that she continuously rates higher than any other brands and products she reviews on her so called “unbiased” web site. Please! If she wants to be impartial, she needs to stop selling her own cosmetics. Jenny November 3, 2010 at 3:03 pm persprex “I feel that those who bash this blog have a poor understanding of and appreciation for science.” ——————————– What you feel is also irrelevant. You mention also that people that have an opinion that natural is better lack critical thinking which is quite ironic because you are the one with extremely conventional views. For one thing,you seem to swallow the opinion that Paula feeds you. If you had any critical thinking, you would see that anyone who sells cosmetics for a living, can’t possibly be impartial in the matter. You might want to also stop making assumptions about people and their backgrounds. In fact, I have a science degree so I am pretty sure that my understanding of science and how it works is pretty much on the money. Science is a business where what’s not profitable gets suppressed, the studies are financed by interested parties and truth is often not black and white. You seem to think that science in practice is some kind of impartial holy grail and while in theory it should be, the reality is quite different. In reality, it’s a business, like any other. Mmmm November 4, 2010 at 11:11 pm Only says 99% organic on a few products. The only exception is their baby line which says 100% organic. Which all their product ingredients are listed online, and on the bottle. I’ve used 100% organic shampoos and conditioners in the past, none work as great as this product. As far as parabens, well, if they’re no real concern according to you who cares if it’s in the product or not. Abby November 12, 2010 at 7:50 pm I haven’t yet tried Yes To Carrots, but I’m researching on whether or not I want to, and I’ve got to say that I’m coming to the conclusion that no matter what the company actually says, its all about personal preference. I think I’ll try a few things and if I like it, I like it, if not, well there are tons of other products out there. I think people are getting a little too heated about this. It’s just a brand. Yes, maybe they’re being a little free with words like ‘natural’ and ‘organic’ or whatever, but it’s not like a ton of other companies don’t do the same thing. Just my thoughts on the whole thing. stepheny November 30, 2010 at 2:16 pm Yes to carrots products are okay, but their customer service is CRAP! I placed an order on their website and and after getting no response I emailed them asking about my order and they emailed and said it was on backorder. Now, over a month later and probably ten more emails of me asking how long my order will be on backorder.. NO RESPONSE! They won’t email me back and I can’t get through on their customer service line. I have tried emailing them from their website customer service and from my own email. Nothing works. They are CRAP CRAP CRAP! I will never buy another Yestocrap product again! Just had to get my two cents in… KRUZINSUZAN January 1, 2011 at 11:01 am I LOVE THESE PRODUCTS. I JUST WENT TO WALGREENS AND I BOUGHT THE BLUEBERRIES SINCE I AM OVER 50. CANT WAIT TO SEE THE CHANGE. I LOVE THE CARROT SHAMPPOO AND CONDITIONER SO DOES MY HUSBAND. ALREADY HAVE 3 FRIENDS CHANGED OVER TO THESE PRODUCTS. OLAY BETTER WATCH OUT!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Puffy January 23, 2011 at 2:36 pm I ve only recently started using Yes To Carrots and I LOVE IT. The gentle exfoliating cleanser is great for everyday use and the daily moisteriser just soaks straight in and leaves your skin feeling so hydrated. People have commented on how my skin looks better. I have started using the night moisteriser too and it is lovely but dont think i actually need it as the day one does such a good job. TRY IT, YOU WONT BE DISAPPOINTED. cathy February 3, 2011 at 10:01 pm I am a new user of this product. I ran across it in Target and decided to give it a try. I bought the Body Moisturizing Lotion. I have skin cancer and after a few outpatient ‘procedures’, I was looking for a good moisturizer while I was healing. This product caught my eye because several of the ingredients listed on the front, are exactly some of the things that are mentioned (medical research) to help ward off (not sure if that’s the right word) skin cancer. After having Liquid Nitrogen blasted on my whole face and parts of my hands, I’m left with scabs that fall off, usually within 2 weeks. My doctor suggested I moisturize more. I’ve been using the YES TO CARROTS lotion and it makes my skin feel so good and I seem to be healing much faster that any previous lotion I was using. I love it! cathy February 3, 2011 at 10:13 pm I would like to rephrase parts of my comment. When I read my own comment, it sounded pretty bad. I didn’t mean to imply my whold face was covered in scabs! Yuk! I had forehead, cheeks, nose, temples and one hand sprayed with the liquid Nitrogen. The only thing that will develope a scab is the spots that have the sun damage. In my case, it was 4 spots on the nose and a couple on the cheek, 3 spots on the hand. Nevertheless, this lotion is great. My last liquid nitrogen ‘treatment’ was the 28th. Using the YES TO CARROTS lotion, the scabs are almost gone. That’s only 5 days compared to the usual 2 weeks! Janice February 6, 2011 at 1:29 pm I recently bought several Y2C products because of a BOGO 50% deal, and I was another couple of weeks away in the budget from ordering from my supplement/personal care vendor. I do not have a real problem with companies using preservatives–I was a devoted Erno Lazslo user for years–but post-menopause, I am very sensitive to both phenoxethenal and parabens and they make me either break out in hives or, if taken internally in products such as Maalox or other over-the-counter or prescription drugs, cause other reactions that are just not fun with which to deal. I seem to have a big problem with carriers, additives, and some preservatives, which drives my drs. nuts when something has to be prescribed. Anyway, I bought the body butter and hand cream and, while I’m not crazy about the smell, I like the action of both products. The skin on my hands crack, become infected, and actually bleed, the result of anything from handling raw meat to washing them too often (even in Dr. Bronner’s)…the hand and elbow lotion helped that in just a few applications. I’ve found that everyone has their own tolerance to substances, either natural or chemical. For me, it is important not to test on animals. And that none of the ingredients in the products I bought by Y2C had yet to cause a reaction. Of course, I usually have to rotate products, even the most pure, because my skin becomes desensitized. Aubrey broke me out something fierce, so did many of the other big names in “natural”. Even pure gold raw shea butter, black soap, and organic jojoba oil gave me problems after extended use. Products I have made from scratch and just from kitchen ingredients have also caused some problems. As for Y2C, some of their products have more “junk” than others…but, in effect, pretty much every company is on the natural bandwagon nowadays and uses the same ploys. Burt’s Bees is owned by Clorox, Tom’s of Maine is owned by, I think Colgate-Palmolive, etc.–correct me if I am wrong. For my face, I use nothing but Devita. I like the company, their policies, and their charities. But I do like Y2C body butter, hand & elbow cream, shampoo, and conditioner–the conditioner is great for henna glossing. And the lip butter. Plus, they are easy to obtain. I do wish they would do a couple of things, though, for the benifit of their desired customer base: disclose exactly what is in the fragrance and sign the compact for safe cosmetics. I don’t think disclosure of the fragrance should be a problem: Olivella responded quickly with an email about their source, which is not natural and in some of their products–some of which are “pure” and unadulterated (loosely speaking), and others which are not. I owned a natural food store for years, and I subscribe to several watchdog groups, such as EWG and Debra Lynn Dadd. But, I am also married to a scientist. And I look at science as a friend, not a foe. There are toxic natural substances, and toxic synthetic ones. Our bodies respond to both pretty much the same. I do feel there are natural alternatives to most chemical substances, but for the sake of safety, and oftentimes, cost, everything has to be taken into consideration. For example, Ecco Bella explains their use of parabens. I can’t use the product, but I appreciate their being forthcoming. The same with Zia, Logona/Sante, AMB, and so forth. Marketing is THE big thing. “Natural” is the big “key”. I don’t fault the companies for doing so. My responsibility is to research everything I buy based on certain criteria that is in line with my code of ethics and standards. I really think everyone should do the same. The tools are out there. The choice is individual. As far as Y2K goes, I do like what I bought, and will probably repurchase. As long as it works. Interesting website, btw. I’ve never run across this one before. Michelle February 9, 2011 at 12:17 pm I ordered products from the Y2C website 10 days ago, and heard nothing from the company after the initial e-mail acknowledging my order. I called Y2C for information about the status of my order. Only then did someone tell me that all of the products I had ordered were on back order, and that they had no idea when the products would be available to be shipped to me. I canceled my order. Every day for ten days, Y2C did not tell me what they knew; I had to come to them for information that they should have offered to me; and they should know when their products are scheduled to be delivered by their manufacturer, to their warehouse. Ayana February 10, 2011 at 6:20 pm @ perspex – Oh my goodness thankyou! I know how you feel. People are all too ready to jump on the most bias argument they read because it’s: A: Dumbed down B: Holds an extreme bias that agrees with theirs I am a pharmacy student, and while looking for a night cream today I came across two options. One was the Say Yes to Carrots night cream, now the shelf was almost completely sold out with only two or so of the SY2C left. So interested, I picked it up to read the ingredients, I thought “Hey, if this stuff is almost sold out, and it’s not even on sale it must be good right?” No, no and more no. Girls when you are looking to buy something, read the ingredients. First of all, the whole hype about the cream is the carrots. Carrots are awesome for your skin because of the retinol that your body derives from Vit. A. however, when you look in the ingredients where are carrots listed. Not anywhere near the top, in fact they were in the lower half of the middle. If you don’t know what that means, I’ll tell you. Ingredients that are in the greatest portions are listed near the top, and the ones that take up the least of the ingredients are listed near the bottom. This means that SY2C doesn’t even put a whole lot of carrots in their products, so what’s the point? When we’re talking about a naturally derived ingredient, the beneficial components of that ingredient aren’t in very high levels to begin with. That means with all this hype about carrots, there isn’t really all that many carrots in the product. If you’re looking for the benefits of retinol, and for whatever reason you’re afraid of synthetics just make a carrot scrub out of 100% organic carrot juice. That way you’re actually getting more than a tiny pinch of carrot on your face. Also, when I asked the lady at the makeup counter why all of the SY2K stuff was gone, it turns out that it’s only because that Michelle Phan did a video on the benefits of carrot products for the skin, and most of the girls didn’t want to make a carrot mask themselves. Go figure. As for the perebens, no they have not been proven to be carcinogenic sorry. We were even joking about all that in my organic chemistry class last month, just like we were laughing at all the companies putting Q10 in their products. There are many studies out there that don’t have conclusive results, so they are repeated by other independent and accredited scientists who legally can hold no bias on the matter. The studies were rendered inconclusive. What is proven is that cheap coconut oil clogs your pores, and that is one of the biggest reasons why I put SY2C night cream right back on the shelf. Cold pressed coconut oil when used in proper amounts and mixed with other ingredients can be beneficial, but in my experience, products that are under $20 can’t feasibly make a profit buying high grade oils while shipping salts from half way across the globe. I would suggest to anyone that if they want the benefits of carrots, to just make their own at home. Then you know you’re getting what you want, and you’re actually getting the benefits from carrots. I would also suggest to people that when doing research on any topic, including about perebens that you make sure that you are reading facts from recent accredited sources. Go to google scholar, search up perebens, and only read articles that have been published within the past 3 years by accredited sources such as universities. These articles are dry, uninteresting for the most part, and true. As for synthetics, would someone kindly explain to me what’s so bad about me going into a lab and synthesizing the very same compounds you like to get from organics such as retinol? Your body can’t tell the difference, it’s the same molecular structure. What you need to look out for is when companies start adding chemicals that are in the products solely for the purpose of making them smell better, or feel more luxurious because they are only in there for those purposes, not to make your skin healthier. So I repeat, your skin can’t tell the difference between the small amounts of retinol it’s synth. from the Vit.A you’re getting from the lotion with carrot in it. Or the retinol I’ve derived in a lab in high concentrations. The only difference it will notice is that the synth version is in a higher amount, and the body doesn’t have to synth. it itself. Just because it’s not organic doesn’t make it evil, in fact, I’m pretty sure that I would be able to improve the structure of many beneficial organic products in lab and make a synth product that A: Works better for your skin, and B: is cheaper than having to do all the processing for the organic. Just sayin’ Denise February 24, 2011 at 11:52 pm I recently went to get a Vitamin E facial from Massage Envy and I must say that it was a great experience. There, I was informed that products with Vitamin E are good for the skin and they fade blemishes. I have had problems with every product that I have used. Mostly I have problems with dark spots after the acne subsides. For the past month I have been using a carrot soap to cleanse my face. I purchased it at a Caribbean store. I tried to use other products to fade the blemishes as the carrot soap fought the acne, but nothing seemed to work. I used Bio-oil and it worked, but it takes a while to see results. I recently purchased the Say Yes to Carrots night creme and the day creme. I must say that I will NEVER purchase another product other than this. It was inexpensive and it works. My face is very soft and it looks healthy. I have received compliments on my skin; people see results and it’s only been 2 weeks. My blemishes have faded and my skin glows. Some people have complained about the smell, but I personally love the smell. I have yet to get a break out. Every morning I wash my face with the carrot soap and I apply a small layer of the Say Yes To Carrots creme over my face. At night I do the same thing, but I apply the night creme. Give it a try. It’s a natural product. My skin is very sensitive and it did not break me out. I also take Vitamin E pills and I drink more water. I hope that you enjoy the product. I’m going to buy the hair products and the lip balm. I’m am very satisfied with the results. Gai March 7, 2011 at 2:52 pm It only makes sense that a small portion of carrot is used in the products since a whole lot of it will turn your skin orange. Who wants orange skin? If you are going to use a face mask made with just carrot, try it on your hand first and see if it changes color. Anyways, I tried one of Yes to Carrots moisturizer with Aloe Vera and Cucumber and I love it. My skin has never been more moisturized. The only thing I worry about is that it does not have the SPF and not sure if the Aloe Vera can make up for that. PoppieFresh March 7, 2011 at 7:46 pm Ayana is right; if you really want carrots on your skin you can make the facial at home. I’ve done it, and it really does work without turning your skin orange, but I’ve always done an oatmeal (straight from the box) scrub immediately after. If you’re feeling ambitious and want to try this at home, remember to cook carrots ’til mushy (microwave works) and smash into a puree. I’ve always added honey to my mix. Ideally, you need to place a cheesecloth over your before applying the facial, but I’ve never done that because it’s not something I keep around the house. Sounds messy? You bet!! I became good at home facials because I was broke and desperate to keep my skin in good shape. I’m almost 43 now and I hardly have any wrinkles. Thankfully, now I can afford real skin care products.","Should you say yes to carrots","e8bf85f35ff83a8e844ec1147daed3e1cf4311fd","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2000/02/should-you-say-yes-to-carrots/"
"The Beauty Brains","2015-05-27 22:42:00","Celebrity Cosmetics: Jennifer Aniston uses Caudalie skin care by The Beauty Brains According to iParenting, Jennifer Aniston uses a French skin care line called Caudalíe (pronounced koh-da-lee) because it contains a grape seed ingredient that has powerful anti-aging properties. Could this be true???? Could celebrities like Jen have access to fountain of youth technology that we regular people can only dream about? To find out we have to take a look at the science of Caudalie. The secret of Caudalie involves the antioxidant properites grape juice. Ok, it’s not exactly grape juice, it’s really a special extract of grape seeds but it supposedly reduces chemicals called free radicals that damage skin. And according to Caudalie, free radicals cause 80% of skin aging. Is this really true? Well, it is true that free radicals cause skin damage and that damage does make the skin appear older. But we can’t find any other source that attributes “80%” of skin damage to free radicals. And, if you read Caudalie’s claim carefully, they don’t say that their product stops 80% of all skin damage, they just say that their product is effective against the thing that causes 80% of the damage. See the difference? The experts agree antioxidants are important but they say that sun protection is a key to fighting skin damage and premature aging. According to Smartskincare.com polyphenols, like those used by Caudalie, “appear to exert sun damage protection by quenching free radicals and reducing inflammation rather than by blocking UV rays” and therefore “may synergistically enhance sun protection when used in addition to a sunscreen.” So, while grape-based antioxidant treatments can be helpful, you should still use a sunscreen. Are there other antioxidants that work? You bet. Although Caudalie claims their grape derived ingredient is highly effective, there are other scientific articles that show that green tea is pretty darn potent too. The Brains Bottom Line Celebrities like Jennifer who use Caudalie maybe getting good protection against free radical damage but they’re certainly paying a pretty penny for the brand name. There are plenty of other products that offer similar functionality at a much lower price. Hey, if you can afford Caudalie go for it. But if you can’t, don’t despair. Antioxidants help but the important thing is to protect your skin with a good sunscreen. You can have great skin even if you can’t afford what the celebrities are using.","Celebrity Cosmetics: Jennifer Aniston uses Caudalie skin care","30bf95f95b5db2e2d5efde0d9fb1c7d9b2a72512","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2006/06/celebrity-cosmetics-jennifer-aniston-uses-caudalie-skin-care/"

"The Beauty Brains","","Top 5 best bath bombs by The Beauty Brains Erica inquires… I saw the following question over at the Soap Making Forum : “what are the benefits of bath bombs? like, what’s each ingredient good for?” Sounds like a good topic for the Beautiful Brains! The Right Brain responds: Thanks for the heads up on the Soap Making Forum, Erica, it’s a very interesting website and they raised a great question. To get an answer let’s start by taking a look at how bath bombs work. Building a bath bomb The key ingredients in a bath bomb are sodium bicarbonate, citric acid, essential oils, and color. They may also contain some miscellaneous goodies. Basically, these things are just one giant wad of fizzy materials. The technology is simple: sodium bicarbonate is reacted with acid to generate carbon dioxide gas. (The same chemistry is used in old school fire extinguishers and in Alka Seltzer tablets.) As long as you keep the bomb dry, they chemicals won’t react. But as soon as you drop in bomb in the tub, the water quickly breaks it apart (usually within 2 minutes) and the reaction begins. The dissolved gas forms bubbles around tiny nucleation sites like the bottom of the bath tub or the hairs on your legs and give your a tingly, tickling sensation. (Yes that’s right for an extra fizzy experience, take your bath before you shave your legs!) Bath bomb benefits So what do these ingredients do for you? Experientially a lot – the bubbles give your skin a tingly treat and the essential oils add to the experience by energizing or relaxing you. But functionally, bath bombs provide minimal skin benefits. If they contain certain kinds of salts there is evidence that they may have a therapeutic effect on skin conditions like psoriasis. But while some websites claim that bicarb has a cleansing effect or that the salts soften the water and increase moisturization, in reality soaking in these chemicals don’t enhance cleansing or skin conditioning. The Top 5 Bath Bombs If you’re looking for cleansing or moisturization, you’ll need a body was or lotion. But if you’re looking for a relaxing bath experience, bombs are the way to go. Here are some of our favorites: Moon’s Harvest’s Chocolate Covered Cherry has to be seen to be believed. Lush’s Too Drunk Emotibomb is the most, uh, unconventional bomb we’ve seen. Fizzy Baker’s Raspberry Cupcake is literally a baked good for your bathtub. SpaGlo’s Cucumber Melon is wonderful if you’re a fan of Bath and Bodyworks. Jane Inc.’s Fresh Flowers has the absolute cutest packaging.And for the thrifty shopper we’ll throw in one more: Home Body makes a bath bomb line that’s about half the price of everyone else’s!

"Randy Schueller","None","Is coconut oil good for nails by Randy Schueller Kitten Devine’s question… I’ve read your post about coconut oil being able to penetrate the hair and strengthen it. Now, since I’m looking for both something moisturizing for my cuticles and something to strengthen my nails Ive started to apply coconut oil to my nails and cuticles (only since yesterday, so I can’t tell if it’s working yet) so I wondered if it works the same way on nails as it does on hair? Can it penetrate the nailplate? And is it even possible for any product/ingredient to penetrate the nails and actually strengthen and condition them? The Beauty Brains reply: Thanks for a very intriguing question, Kitten. So far, we’ve not been able to find a definitive answer in the scientific literature but we did uncover a couple of interesting tidbits in the Journal of the Society of Cosmetic Chemists. Nourishing nails First, it is known that nails are more flexible when the water content is higher. And when you’re nails are more flexible they’re less likely to chip and break. But surprisingly, oil alone does not have much effect on nails. Researchers treated nails with mineral oil showed no increase in flexibility. But when they applied mineral oil to previously hydrated nails their flexibility was increased. This finding suggests the oil itself is not strengthening the nail against breakage, but that the oil can lock in water. Another experiment showed that an oil and water mixture (specifically a phospholipid-water preparation for those of you keeping score at home) did boost nail flexibility. The researchers theorized that oily material that can bind and seal water in the nails are helpful in improving flexibility (and therefore, strength.) Second, the same article also pointed out that some materials can penetrate the nail but there was no indication that penetration and strengthening were connected. The Beauty Brains bottom line Oil can help keep nails moisturized and keep them strong by making them more flexible so they’re less likely to chip and break.

"The Beauty Brains","","What should I do about my ear infection? by The Beauty Brains Carla B. is curious… I got pierced last month and when I touch behind my ear it feels crusty and I want to know what to do about it. The Right Brain answers: Sounds like Carla has gotten a pierced-ear infection. This problem can be caused by contamination from unsterile piercing equipment or posts or even from frequently touching the earlobes with dirty hands. It can also be caused by wearing earrings that are either too tight or cheaply made. B.D. Schmitt, M.D., author of “Your Child’s Health,” has written an outstanding description of the problem and what to do about it. For example, did you know you’re supposed to turn your earring posts 3 spins, twice a day for the first 6 weeks after your piercing? Neither did we! For this and more helpful info on what to do next, check out Dr. Schmitt’s page here .","What should I do about my ear infection?","2afd4b3dfb6ccb1d0bab1adfe1058c664d0cd648","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2009/11/what-should-i-do-about-my-ear-infection/"
"The Beauty Brains","2017-06-14 07:18:00","Slippery When Wet: In-Shower Moisturizing by The Beauty Brains Kim inquires: In the winter, I swear by Olay’s In Shower Body Lotion . It works better and lasts longer than any regular moisturizer I’ve ever tried. How does it work even after you rinse it off? Why is it different from other moisturizers or moisturizing spa bath body washes? Is it safe? The Left Brain responds: As the name implies, this lotion is designed to be used in the shower. You rub it on your body after you wash and then rinse it off (just like you use a rinse off hair conditioner.) P&G (makers of Olay) have developed a very interesting formula for this product. Take a look at the ingredient list: Olay Ingredients Water, Petrolatum, Mineral Oil, Hydroxypropyl Starch Phosphate, Dimethicone, Fragrance, Stearyl Alcohol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Niacinamide, Panthenol, Mica, Polysorbate 60, Titanium Dioxide, DMDM Hydantoin, Disodium EDTA, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, Cetyl Alcohol, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Phenoxyethanol, Tin Oxide Pay attention to the first five ingredients: three of them very hydrophobic (meaning water insoluble) moisturizers: petrolatum, mineral and dimethicone. These ingredients are good at creating a barrier that prevents water vapor from escaping your skin. How Is Olay In Shower Lotion different than other moisturizers? Compared to traditional lotions there are two main differences. The moisturizing ingredients noted above are high up in the ingredient list. Normally the fatty alcohols that form the body of the lotion are the primary ingredients. Second, this formula uses a modified starch to suspend/emulsify the ingredients instead of traditional emulsifiers. (Regular lotions usually contain two or more emulsifiers to help the oil and water soluble ingredients mix.) Because of the way regular lotions are formulated, most of their moisturizing ingredients will rinse off and go down the drain if you use them in the shower. Olay’s In Shower product uses a modified starch to tie the water and oil soluble ingredients together. They’ve balanced the formula such that the oily ingredients aren’t highly emulsified. That way, when you apply it in the shower, these ingredients tend to stay behind on the skin instead of mixing with the shower water and rinsing away. Safe in the shower? Is it safe? Sure, these ingredients are excellent moisturizers. The only danger I see is that the high concentration of water insoluble ingredients could end up making the shower floor very slippery. Has anyone tried Olay’s In Shower Lotion and slipped in the shower? Slip in and leave a comment.","Slippery When Wet: In-Shower Moisturizing","3c0fc260b5c5cb84786baedab5e99f5475c46fe0","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2007/11/slippery-when-wet-in-shower-moisturizing/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Is dead sea salt good for your skin? by The Beauty Brains Darla wants to know: “I read that products using Dead Sea salts are good for your skin. Should I be using a Dead Sea Salt scrub instead of my wrinkle cream ? Is there any truth to this at all?” The Right Brain Responds: The Dead Sea is the second saltiest body of water on Earth and its salts have been reputed to have healing properties since Biblical times. Can this be true? Is Dead Sea salt better than “regular” salt? Yes it is, at least according to a study conducted at the University of Negev, Israel. The Journal of the European Adcademy of Dermatology and Venereology, published a paper (9 (1997) 237-242, Dead Sea Bath Salt for the treatment of psoriasis vulgaris) by authors Halevy, et. al, that attempted to answer this very question. The researchers treated 30 patients with psoriasis vulgaris, a condition involving rapidly dividing, overactive cells that causes patchy, scaley skin. The patients were first evaluated using the Psoriasis Area and Serverity Index (PASI), a scale that indicates the intensity of the condition. The patients were then divided into two groups: The control group were treated with common salt and the test group were treated with a Dead Sea salt mixture. The treatment for both groups involved soaking in warm, salty bath water for 20 minutes each day for a period of 3 weeks. At the end of the treatment, patients were assessed using the PSAI scale again. The results showed that both types of salt water baths significantly reduced the extent and the severity of the psoriasis. However, the Dead Sea salt soak reduced the psoriasis a bit more. (However, the researchers point out that not all measurements reached a statistically valid level.) Still, this is pretty good evidence that the Dead Sea salt mixture is better at reducing the effects of psoriasis. Why is this the case? No one knows for sure, but it apparently is related to proportion of magnesium, bromide and other counter ions contained in Dead Sea salt. The Beauty Brains Bottom Line: Soaking in salt water does benefit certain dry skin conditions, such as psoriasis. While even ordinary salt is helpful in this regard, Dead Sea Salts may offer some additional level of benefit. But that doesn’t mean a product containing Dead Sea salts will help other skin problems, like wrinkles.","Is dead sea salt good for your skin?","4cdb11000e8aa4debd4b84d45e480fc1b9e2439a","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2007/03/is-dead-sea-salt-good-for-your-skin/"
"The Beauty Brains","None","Another cosmetic ingredient to be afraid of by The Beauty Brains Lindsay’s looking for information: What is quaternium/polyquaternium? If you have allergic contact dermatitis to quaternium-15 should you avoid contact with any other poly/quaternium numbers? The Left Brain helps her out: Quaternium and Polyquaternium (or “Quats” for short) are the names of CATEGORIES of chemicals. There are many different chemicals in each category. For example, there’s Quaternium 15, 18, 24, 27, 80 and Polyquaternium-6, 7, 10, 11, and 28 to name a few. Quat doesn’t mean squat Unfortunately, the name doesn’t really tell you anything about the chemical itself. The actual chemical name of Quaternium 15 is Methenamine 3-chloroallylochloride but it’s also known as 3,5,7-Triaza-1-azoniatricyclo(3.3.1.13,7)decane, 1-(3-chloro-2-propenyl)-, chloride; N-(3-Chloroallyl)hexaminium chloride; and Hexamethylenetetramine chloroallyl chloride. You can see why we call it “Quaternium-15” for short! Anyway, this particular quat is a preservative – it keeps bugs from growing in your cosmetics. It works by releasing formaldehyde, which probably explains your reaction to it. Other quats may have similar names, but that doesn’t mean they will react with your skin the same way. For example, Quaternium-18 is a long chain fatty conditioning agent and Quaternium-80 is a silicone based conditioner. The chemistry of these Quats is completely different from number 15. The Beauty Brains bottom line Not all Quats are created equal. Stay away from Quat-15 if you know it gives you problems but that doesn’t mean you have to shy away from the rest. I assume you’re not the only person with this question and it will be interesting to see if any companies begin offering “Quat-free” products. But so far, the “naturals” crowd don’t seem too worried about Quats. Jason Natural Cosmetics, for example, are pretty picky about their ingredients and they have an Apple and Green Tea shampoo that contains polyquats. By the way, if you’re not sure if you have contact dermatitis or not, read our previous post on how to tell the difference between skin allergies and skin irritation .","Another cosmetic ingredient to be afraid of","d0cb89a4ed37a264b160ebee64d7e386a65687f7","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2007/09/another-cosmetic-ingredient-to-be-afraid-of/"
"The Beauty Brains","","What is a cheaper alternative to Pureology conditioner? by The Beauty Brains NCFiction needs to know… I have dry curly hair, and the Hydrate line helps make it soft! At 8.5 oz for almost $30 Pureology conditioner is NOT cheap! I’m used to getting conditioner that has three times that for $6! (Aussie Moist.) But my hair was still feeling dry so I am looking for a cheaper alternative. There are loads of stuff in this formula, I can see why it’s so expensive… any ideas? The Left Brain responds: The amount of “stuff” in the formula actually has nothing to do with the price. I’ll break it down for you… Pureology ingredients First, look at ALL the ingredients: Water, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cetrimonium Chloride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein PG-Propyl Silantriol, Superoxide Dismutase, Melanin, Ascorbic Acid,Tocopheryl Acetate, Hilanthus Annuus (Sunlfower) seed extract and oil, Butylene glycol, Amodimethicone, C11-15 Pareth 7, Laureth 9, Glycerin, Trideceth 12, Citric Acid, Lactic acid, Malic acid, Camelia sinesis leaf extract, mucor mehei extract, lentinus edodes extract, ganoderma lucidum extract, mentha piperita (peppermint) leaf extract, Sage leaf extract, Rosemary leaf extract, Cetrimonium Bromide, Dimethiconol, Divinyldimethicone/dimethicone copolymer, C12-13 Pareth-23, C12-13 Pareth-3, Glycerth-26, Panthenol, Jojoba Esters, PEG-45M, Ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate, butyrospermum parii (shea butter), wheat amino acids, mentha arvensis leaf oil, menthol, glycine soja (soybean) oil, Hydrolyzed Oat Protein, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Polysorbate 60, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Methylparaben, Fragrance Now I’ll strip away everything except the ingredients that actually condition your hair: Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cetrimonium Chloride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Amodimethicone, Glycerin, Cetrimonium Bromide, Dimethiconol, Divinyldimethicone/dimethicone copolymer These are the key conditioning ingredients. Conditioner copycat Now, if you want a formula that works the same, the first thing you do is look to see who makes Pureology. It turns out to be L’Oreal. They bought Pureology in 2007. So, look at other L’Oreal formulas like the Vives and find one with similar ingredients to the listing above. If those don’t work, try Pantene, Fructis, or Dove which all use similar ingredients. There really is nothing special about the Pureology formula which would warrant the price that they charge. What do YOU think? Do you have any favorite conditioners you’d like to share with NC?

"The Beauty Brains","","Is moroccan oil good for hair and skin? by The Beauty Brains Barb would like to know… What’s the deal with Moroccan oil? I’ve read all the rave reviews on Amazon.com but I’d like the real scoop from the Beauty Brains. The Right Brain responds: Actually, Barb, we’ve already answered this question. Sort of. Moroccan oil = Argan oil? Moroccan oil is another name for Argan oil which is made from the kernels of argan tree fruit that grow almost exclusively in Morocco. You can read our previous post on Argan oil for hair and skin but here’s what you need to know in a nut shell: the oil is a rich emollient that can moisturize hair and skin; it can potentially cause zits so be careful if you’re prone to breakouts; and it does NOT come from goat poop. (You’ll have to read the original post and all the comments to get that reference. Whoo boy, did we piss some people off! But I digress…) The product “Moroccan Oil” is sold by the company Moroccanoil (R) and is made with Argan oil. Let’s take a look at its ingredients. Moroccan Oil ingredients Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone, Cyclomethicone, Butylphenyl, MethylPropional, Argania Spinoza Kernal Oil (Aragan Oil), Linseed (Linum Usitatissimum) Extract, Fragrance Supplement, D&C Yellow-11, D&C Red-17, Coumarin, Benzyl Benzoate, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone As you can see, most of the product is made up of various silicones. That’s not a bad thing at all, silicone-based antifrizz products are very effective. Remember John Frieda’s Frizz- Ease? But just be aware that you’re not buying pure Argan oil.

"Randy Schueller","None","Why is Pureology shampoo so good? by Randy Schueller Karen is inquisitive… Can you kindly explain what makes Pureology shampoo feel so much different than anything else I’ve tried? I’m guessing it’s not the botanical infusion! The Right Brain responds: Good guess, Karen, the difference has nothing to do with green tea or sandalwood. It’s all about the cleansers and conditioners. Pureology ingredients Most shampoos are based on a blend of 1 or 2 primary surfactants with another 1 or two secondary surfactants. Pureology (at least the Anti-fade variant), has 7, count ‘em 7 different cleansing agents: Sodium Lauryl Sulfoacetate, Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Sodium Lauryl Sarcosinate, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine, Cocamidopropylamine Oxide, and Decyl Glucoside. (Actually the total number of surfactants is more like 9 or 10 if you count some of the minor ingredients.) This cleansing blend gives Pureology an extraordinarily rich lather for a sulfate-free shampoo. On top of that, it’s formulated with three potent conditioning agents: amodimethicone, a organo-modified silicone that provides excellent conditioning effect; Polyquaternium-7 which also gives excellent wet slip; and a chemically modified guar gum that smooths hair. Is Pureology perfect? So what’s the downside, you ask? For one thing the claims about controlling color fading are over stated. Based on research we’ve seen, sulfate-free shampoos do not strip less color than their sulfate containing cousins. Plus, at $28 for 10 ounces, Pureology is not cheap! You might want to consider trying EverPure shampoo because it’s a similar formula that costs a lot less. Would you spend $28 on a bottle of shampoo?

"The Beauty Brains","","Should my shower stay sulfate-free? by The Beauty Brains Somnuz Sez: Hi. Just wanted to know your thoughts regarding sulfate-free products. If products do not contain surfactants, can they still clean. Or, if they contain lesser know surfactants, could they be even more harmful than SLS and SLES? Am trying some sulfate-free products and would love to know what you think of them. Ren shower washes and also the Mir skincare range. The Right Brain’s Response: To answer your question, first let’s take a look at 4 quick reasons why sulfates (like sodium lauryl sulfate, ammonium lauryl sulfate, and their cousins the laureth sulfates) are so popular. Why sulfates are popular 1) They’re very cheap and they’re readily available. Basic sulfates can cost as little as 25 cents per pound. More expensive surfactants can be $1.00 or more per pound. 2) They’re good cleaners. Sulfates are good at dissolving dirt and oil, especially the kind found on your hair and body. So they work really well in shampoos and body washes. 3) They foam well. Sulfates are extremely good at generating a lot of foam really fast. Even though you can have a good cleansing product that doesn’t foam, consumers tend to like high foaming products better. 4) They’re easy to thicken. Lauryl sulfates (not so much the laureth ones) can be thickened just by adding salt. Therefore, the companies that manufacture shampoos and body washes like to formulate with sulfates because their products can be made quickly and easily. So, what about sulfate free products? Well, by comparison they generally are more expensive, they may not foam as well (depending on the formula. Consider a baby shampoo for example), and they require more complex formulas because they can’t be thickened with salt. The sad side of sulfates So why would your want to use sulfate free products? Well, a potential downside of using sulfates is that they can dry out your hair and skin. Sulfate free formulas can be milder because they don’t strip the natural oils out of your skin as much. Also, sulfates can really make your eyes sting. Sulfate free products can be formulated to be non-stinging and “tear-free.” The Beauty Brains bottom line: Yes, sulfate free formulas will still clean and no they’re not more dangerous. In fact, if anything, they’re a bit milder to your skin and eyes. So feel free to experiment. The Ren and Mir products are perfectly fine but they’re very overpriced. If you just want to experiment with sulfate free but don’t want to spend a lot of money, try a baby shampoo. The Foam Gnome By the way, in case you’re wondering about the picture in today’s post, we’d like to introduce you to the newest member of The Beauty Brains team, the Foam Gnome. Foam Gnome will be answering all your questions about anything that foams, from shampoos and body washes to shave creams, to the mouths of rabid dogs. Ok, that’s stupid. Scratch that.

"The Beauty Brains","","The terrible toll of trichotillomania by The Beauty Brains With all the glitz and glamor of the cosmetic industry, it`s easy to forget there are many unfortunate people stricken with various diseases or disorders that make it impossible for them to enjoy the same beauty experiences that most of us take for granted. Some of these conditions are serious enough to be life threatening, others are not physically harmful but cause startling changes in appearance that are psychologically damaging. All of these cases are sad. This series highlights a few of these cosmetic diseases and disorders. If you have any of these, our hearts go out to you. If you don`t have them “ be thankful you`re healthy! Part 1 of this series covers trichotillomania (or TTM). What Is Trichotillomania? TTM is an impulse disorder that causes people to pull out the hair from their scalp, eyelashes, eyebrows, or other parts of the body. They literally can not stop tugging on their hair. If enough hair is pulled out over time, it stops growing back, this is called traction alopecia. Who Does It Affect? According to the Trichotillomania Learning Center this condition affects between 1 and 2% of all Americans. Other sources estimate that as much as 10% of the world`s population are affected by this condition to some degree. TTM usually strikes in the pre- or early adolescent years. Women are most often diagnosed with TTM but the research is not clear if this means there is a real gender bias, or if men are just less likely to report symptoms or are better at hiding them. This may be the case since researchers have identified a type of TTM that affects very young boys and girls at an equal rate. What are the Symptoms? The primary symptom of this condition is the appearance of bald spots or patches where hair has been pulled out. The amount of hair pulled out and the area of the body affected varies from person to person. But must serious suffers have permanent bald areas that they attempt to hide or disguise (using scarves,clothing, make up, etc). The frequency of hair pulling and the intensity of the urge, varies as well. Sometimes the urge is mild and can be controlled through will power but for some people it becomes an unstoppable obsession. Follow the links below to see examples of Trichsters (the affectionate term used to describe people who suffer from this condition.) The first one is an amazing before and after picture of a Trichster with hair extensions: Trichster with hair extentions More Trichsters One More Trichster What Causes TTM? Some researchers suggest that a reaction to Malassezia, a common skin yeast, could cause the itch-like urge that many trichsters report. Once triggered, the urge can grow into an psychological obsession. There is also data that indicates this process is stress related. Can TTM be treated? There may be an underlying physical effect that triggers the urge, but there is no doubt that an emotional component drives the condition. Therefore, treatment typically involves cognitive-behavior therapy. Several sites have links to good information on treatment options . With the right treatment, it is possible to recover and those who have over come this condition are said to be Pull Free. To learn more directly from those who have suffered from this condition, check out this UK trichotillomania site. With the advancement in the field of plastic surgery , now it’s possible to cure the acne treatments of the most scary skin disorders. With the help of numerous surgical and non surgical procedures, the appearance and function of a person’s body is changed. Plastic surgery procedures consist of both aesthetic enhancements plus functionally reconstructive operations as a part of skin treatment .","The terrible toll of trichotillomania","13e00ee93aaf488d1c7a6bf967cbc47c3a6a1747","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2007/03/the-terrible-toll-of-trichotillomania/"
"The Beauty Brains","2015-12-09 15:34:00","Drying dilemma: What’s the best way to dry your hair? by The Beauty Brains Ellie asks: I usually don’t have the patience to blow dry my hair completely. But my hair dresser told me it is better to dry the hair roots completely than half blow drying the hair and then let it dry by itself. Is it true? The Right Brain responds: We think this idea is kind of silly but we’ll avoid the temptation to just tell you to get a new hair dresser and instead we’ll try to present both sides of the story. Technically Speaking… It’s more damaging to blow dry or towel dry your hair than it is to let it air dry. It’s as simple as that. That’s because heat from blow dryers can mess with the natural lipid distribution in your hair AND degrade the intercellular cement that holds the hair’s protective cuticle in place. And the physical abrasion from towel drying not only loosens healthy cuticles but can actually wear them away! So if you dry your hair a lot you’ll end up with less shine and more split ends. Stylistically Speaking… We assume a hair dresser would argue that blow drying keeps your hair sleek and smooth and that air drying makes it frizzy. But we don’t want to make the wrong assumption. Are there any hairdressers out there reading this? Post a comment with your opinion on this notion of partially drying hair. So, Ellie, it looks like the answer to your drying dilemma could come down to what’s more important to you: avoiding damage or fighting frizz? Only you can decide that. (But, hey, if you’re THAT worried about frizz you can always use a good smoothing product after you dry your hair. You can buy an entire CASE (!) of this effective frizz fighter for only 20 bucks!","Drying dilemma: What’s the best way to dry your hair?","7655ff3e581cdcf301945b12045b3d8eb0b3191c","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2007/09/drying-dilemma-whats-the-best-way-to-dry-your-hair/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Is Brazilian keratin straightening safe? by The Beauty Brains HLBrown asks… My hairdresser swears by a process called the “Brazilian Blowout,” saying it can actually change and rebuild the hair’s structure. A shampoo is first applied which removes all build-up. Then the solution, using the solution by Brazilian Blowout is applied all over the hair with a comb. The hair is then flat-ironed to “bake in” the treatment. Once entirely flat-ironed, the solution is washed out with Brazilian Blowout shampoo and a deep conditioning cream conditioned is left in for 5 minutes. Could this $300 + in chair treatment make the hair healthier? The Left Brain responds: The Blowout sounds like another name for the so-called Brazilian Keratin Straightening process which uses a high concentration of formaldehyde (or similar compounds) in combination with flat ironing to restructure hair. Does it work? Does it make your hair healthier? Well, it certainly makes it straighter. (Did you read our post on 7 Ways To Get Straighter Hair ?) And as I pointed out in our Forum , the reason hair looks shinier after one of these treatments is because the hair is straighter. Straighter hair has less curves, reflects light better, and thus looks shinier. Straightened hair also feels softer and smoother because the cuticles are flattened down. A rough feel is a result of uplifted cuticles. The treatment doesn’t actually re-build hair in the way that is implied (or directly claimed). The protein structure of a hair fiber is much more complicated than a simple straightening iron + hair treatment could ever reconstruct. It would be like trying to fix a hole in a blouse by putting it in a waffle iron with yarn and glue. You might cover the hole but you certainly haven’t “rebuilt” the purse. Is it safe? The problem with this process is safety. While low levels of formaldehyde don’t pose any problems, exposure to high levels has been linked to health problems, including cancer. Unfortunately, this is exactly the scenario that the Brazilian kits promote – the heat of the flat iron vaporizes the formaldehyde and exposes you to unacceptably high levels of the gas. In the UK, the Cosmetics, Toiletries and Perfume Association recently reported that some products contain up to 10% formaldehyde (the limit under the UK Cosmetic Products Safety Regulations is only 0.2%). They’ve posted a warning on their website www.thefactsabout.co.uk to inform the public that there are legal, safe limits of formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde and glyoxal that are allowed in cosmetic products and that some ‘Brazilian’ hair treatments may use dangerous levels of these chemicals. What do YOU think? Would you use a risky product to get straighter hair?

"The Beauty Brains","","Bizarre ways to make your makeup last by The Beauty Brains Cady’s question… Recently I was involved in a conversation with two women discussing ways to make foundation last longer. One said to use hairspray to set foundation, and the other said use antiperspirant on the face to stop sweat from ruining your makeup. They assured me this was safe. I don’t see how it could be, but what do I know? What do you think? (I was mildly horrified but did not want to expose the extent of my ignorance.) The Right Brain replies: In general we get nervous when we hear people recommend using a product on a part of the body it wasn’t designed for, so we share your horror. Hairspray heresy Using hairspray in this context doesn’t really make sense to us. Hairspray works by spraying tiny droplets that make little “weld” spots that hold hair in place. The formula is not designed to form a uniform layer on skin. Aerosol hairsprays would blast way too much product; nonaerosol sprays can be controlled better but they contain water which is exactly what you’re trying to avoid! The bottom line is: It would very difficult to apply a thin coating of hairspray to your face that would dry uniformly and leave a protective cover over your makeup. Plus, as Purple Rules pointed out in our Forum , why would you want to spray hairspray directly at your face? Not a recommended practice for sure! Antiperspirant angst In theory a facial antiperspirant could help reduce sweat that could cause makeup to smear. But in reality, the waxy antiperspirant base would interfere with the makeup’s ability to adhere to the skin. This would give you a much heavier coating than primers. And while it may not be a serious issue, it’s not a good idea to use antiperspirants anyplace other that your pits. The aluminum salts can cause irritation on face especially on the thinner skin around the eyes.

"Perry Romanowski","2015-12-28 11:33:00","Is moroccan oil good for hair and skin by Perry Romanowski Barb would like to know… What’s the deal with Moroccan oil? I’ve read all the rave reviews on Amazon.com but I’d like the real scoop from the Beauty Brains. The Right Brain responds: Actually, Barb, we’ve already answered this question. Sort of. Moroccan oil = Argan oil? Moroccan oil is another name for Argan oil which is made from the kernels of argan tree fruit that grow almost exclusively in Morocco. You can read our previous post on Argan oil for hair and skin but here’s what you need to know in a nut shell: the oil is a rich emollient that can moisturize hair and skin; it can potentially cause zits so be careful if you’re prone to breakouts; and it does NOT come from goat poop. (You’ll have to read the original post and all the comments to get that reference. Whoo boy, did we piss some people off! But I digress…) The product “Moroccan Oil” is sold by the company Moroccanoil (R) and is made with Argan oil. Let’s take a look at its ingredients. Moroccan Oil ingredients Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone, Cyclomethicone, Butylphenyl, MethylPropional, Argania Spinoza Kernal Oil (Aragan Oil), Linseed (Linum Usitatissimum) Extract, Fragrance Supplement, D&C Yellow-11, D&C Red-17, Coumarin, Benzyl Benzoate, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone As you can see, most of the product is made up of various silicones. That’s not a bad thing at all, silicone-based antifrizz products are very effective. Remember John Frieda’s Frizz- Ease? But just be aware that you’re not buying pure Argan oil. The Beauty Brains bottom line Moroccan Oil appears to be a well formulated hair tamer – but if you’re looking for pure Argan oil, you should consider other products which you can get at BeautyStopOnline.com .

"The Beauty Brains","","Why does shampoo lather better the second time? by The Beauty Brains Vananners is vexed… Why does shampoo lather better the second time? Especially with those ‘sulfate-free’ ones. The first time you shampoo it may not lather that well but when you follow up (right away) with a second shampooing the lather is crazy! Also, do you think it’s beneficial to shampoo twice in the shower? I have been doing that lately because I only shampoo about 2-3 times a week and want to get a good, deep clean while I’m doing it. The Left Brain responds: Lather is a function of three key variables: the type of surfactant(s) used in the formula, the concentration at which they are used, and the presence of “anti-foam” agents. Anti-foamers are typically oily materials that “use up” some of the surfactants ability to produce lather. Lather, rinse, repent The first time you wash your hair you’re removing all (or at least most of) the anti-foamers (dirt and oils) that have built up in your hair since the last time you shampooed. These oily materials reduce how much lather the shampoo can create. (This lather reduction is particularly acute for sulfate-free shampoos because their lathering capacity is lower.) The second time you suds up, you get a lot more lather because the anti-foam agents have been washed away. Washing your hair twice is not a bad idea but it depends on how dirty your hair is and how much residue from styling products is present. Washing twice may also increase your need to use a conditioner. How many times do YOU typically wash your hair?

"The Beauty Brains","","New eyelash growth product shows the right way to launch a cosmetic drug by The Beauty Brains Longtime readers of the Beauty Brains are familiar with all that we have written about eyelash growth products. We were skeptical of claims by Jan Marini at first because there was no supporting data presented. Then we found a study that showed there was a material that seemed to have stimulated eyelash growth . We were still skeptical, but at least this was some supporting data. Then Jan Marini admitted that the product doesn’t actually make your eyelashes grow . Finally, their product was seized by the FDA and taken off the shelf for being an illegal drug. It was quite a mess, but an excellent example of how a cosmetic company shouldn’t market a product. Cosmetics are not drugs Cosmetics are not drugs. They are products designed to be put on your skin or hair to temporarily change the surface properties like make-up, cleansers, lipstick & lotions. Hair growth, skin lightening, and anti-dandruff products interact with your body’s metabolism and are drugs, not cosmetics. Drugs are much more dangerous, so they require more thorough testing before being approved by the government. Allergan Launches Eyelash Growth This latest announcement by Allergan of a new eyelash growth product demonstrates the “correct” way to launch a drug product in the US. 1. You accidentally discover an unexpected beneficial effect. (eyelash growth) 2. You conduct a clinical trial & safety tests following approved FDA protocols. 3. You file your results with the FDA and wait for approval. 4. After approval, you market your product. Forging ahead without governmental approval can result in bogus products that don’t work or even worse, unapproved drugs that can have unexpected, dangerous side effects. When you create a product that is changing people’s metabolism, it is reasonable for the government to require appropriate safety & performance testing be done. For your own safety, please stay away from cosmetics that make drug claims! Incidentally, Allergan hopes to launch their approved eyelash product in 2009. What do you use to make your eyelashes look longer and fuller? And would you buy an untested drug if it might help with your cosmetic problem?","New eyelash growth product shows the right way to launch a cosmetic drug","3c3b0fb5e0374dbf177d96463c5df085540de57f","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2008/07/new-eyelash-growth-product-shows-the-right-way-to-launch-a-cosmetic-drug/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Home laser treatment could revolutionize the anti-aging market by The Beauty Brains Jennifer’s seeing red: I’ve got a gizmo called the “Red Light Therapy Wand With Infrared and Magnetic Massage Function” or something like that. It’s supposed to stimulate the skin to grow new collagen by zapping the dermis with a combination of red visible light and infrared waves. This is the first I’ve heard of using red light bulbs to rejuvenate skin. Is there anything to this? If so, couldn’t someone just make their own “red light therapy wand” by strapping some red cello over a flash light and basking in its glow? The Red Brain, uh, I mean Right Brain responds: Believe it or not, shining a light on your skin can reduce wrinkles. Provided, of course, that it’s the right kind of light! Intense Pulse Light Technology Fights Wrinkles Intense Pulse Light (IPL) technology involves using a special type of laser light on skin to stimulate collagen production. This process has been proven to make your skin tighter and less wrinkley but it’s expensive and it takes a while to work. (For more details, you can read our previous post on photofacials .) “Regular” red light (visible or infrared wavelengths) does not have the same effect on the underlying layers of skin as IPL does, so your “Red Light Therapy Wand” is not the real deal. Because of the specialized laser equipment required for a photo facial , this kind of treatment has been available only through derms or professional spas. That is, until now: Cosmeticdesign.com reports that P&G is looking at a home IPL device that can “simultaneously harness bi-polar and optical energies to overcome the safety and operating limitations that, until recently, has meant other IPL therapies have had to be carried out by professionals.” Sounds better than another worthless wrinkle cream , doesn’t it? And definitely better than putting red cellophane over a light bulb!","Home laser treatment could revolutionize the anti-aging market","2e6ca0e3896d75167ef63981c2fd82fb79189ef2","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2007/03/home-laser-treatment-could-revolutionize-the-anti-aging-market/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Is charcoal good for acne? by The Beauty Brains Joolia’s just asking: There’s a product called Dr. Ci:Labo Basic Black Blemish Control Gel that uses charcoal to treat acne. Does it really help? The Right Brain simply says: It’s tough to find much information on this product, but according Dr. Ci:Labo’s website : “Charcoal and gentle botanical extracts in Blemish Control Gel help to prevent the problem of oily skin by removing excess sebum.” The company doesn’t seem to be making any direct claims about acne, but by calling the product “Blemish Control” they’re certainly implying it’s good for pimples! What causes acne? As you know if you read our post on the causes of acne , there are three different factors that cause your face to populated with pimples. Excess skin oil (sebum) production is one of the causes, but if just getting rid of oil could cure acne, all you’d have to do is wash your face. You also need to beat back the bacteria and regulate the speed at which your skin cells are sloughing off. Can charcoal really help? But back to Dr. Ci:Labo. Does charcoal really regulate skin oil? Highly unlikely. The idea that tiny charcoal sponges could soak up oil off your face and make it magically disappear is a bit hard to swallow. Besides, the oil level of your skin is self-regulating. Drying up the surface just triggers the layers beneath to produce more oil. And finally, we searched the technical literature and couldn’t find ANY mention of charcoal having any beneficial skin properties. But if anyone in the Beauty Brains’ community has any seen any references to this, let us know and we’ll look into them. The Beauty Brains Bottom Line Even if charcoal does have oil absorbing properties, that alone will not stop acne. This product may be a perfectly fine facial lotion but unless it contains a proven anti-acne ingredient, like salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide, it won’t have any effect on zits.","Is charcoal good for acne?","e668d117da11eb5c402b65bf10e9e97d2c9d0f75","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2007/08/is-charcoal-good-for-acne/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Beauty product review: the buzz on Burt’s Bees by The Beauty Brains Since the time I first saw them for sale in my college bookstore, I’ve admired Burt’s Bees products. Not because the products are better than others (they’re not), but because they have a “homey” feel that just makes me smile when I see them. Burt’s buzz Burt’s Bees follows in the footsteps of numerous companies by telling us a “natural, eco-friendly” story. As they say on their website “Our ingredients and packaging choices reflect our careful consideration of the impact our activities will have on our environment and the overall health and well-being of all living things on Earth.” But unlike a lot of these natural companies, Burt’s Bees does a pretty good job of “walking the walk”. A quick review of their formulas show that these things really are different. They don’t just tell you that they are natural then sprinkle in a few natural sounding ingredients in their regular formulas. No, they really try to give the consumer something different. Look at this Herbal shampoo for example. The ingredients are Vegetable Glycerin, Lemon Fruit Water, Sucrose Cocoate (Sugar and Coconut Cleanser), Decyl Polyglucose (Sugar and Corn Cleanser), Willowbark Extract, Organic Peppermint Leaf Extract, Willow Leaf Extract, Organic Burdock Root Extract, Organic Nettles Leaf Extract, Yucca Schidigera Extract, Cedar Leaf Oil, Tea Tree Oil, Lemon Oil, Rosemary Oil, Juniper Oil, Peppermint Oil, Xanthan Gum, Glucose & Glucose Oxidase & Lactoperoxidase (Sugar and Natural Enzyymes) We’ll excuse them for not strictly following the labeling conventions in this country (vegetable glycerin, lemon fruit water and the word “organic” are not supposed to be used). Natural formula This formula is really unique. No sulfate detergents or other standard substitutes. Sucrose Cocate and Decyl Polyglucose are detergents but they aren’t very good. No conventional preservatives or fragrances. The oils listed will have an odor and some of them have a natural preservative effect. And having glycerin as the first ingredient means there must be a lot of it in there. Interestingly, they claim it is only 90.1% natural. I wonder what the other 9.9% is because all of those ingredients look natural. Probably the detergents and maybe even the glycerin. Not having tried the product comments on the performance are dubious however, based on the ingredients, this formula will certainly not perform like standard shampoos. It will not give lots of foam or clean as well (that’s why they tell you to use it twice) and it may spoil overtime. Formulas with no good preservatives are a bit scary. For safety reasons, you should throw away any of these products if they are more than 6 months old. While this formula is different than standard ones, that doesn’t mean it is worse. Standard shampoo formulas probably clean too well anyway and foaming is overrated. Manufacturers make shampoos that give lots of foam but it is only done because consumers think more foam = better. This isn’t true since you can make a terrible shampoo that foams great. The Beauty Brains bottom line All the other Burt’s Bees formulas have a similar theme. They definitely make formulas that are unconventional using non-standard ingredients. In most cases, they are not going to perform as well as the more “high tech” products you can buy in your local drugstore, but they might just be good enough. And if the idea of “natural” products is more appealing to you than “the best functioning” products, then try them for yourself and you decide.","Beauty product review: the buzz on Burt’s Bees","a9907a051d9c7598cb34db609d9e9da4db3726a7","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2009/12/beauty-product-review-the-buzz-on-burts-bees-2/"

Jason Natural shampoo ingredients Aqua, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Gel (Aloe Vera), Sodium Myreth Sulfate, Cocamide MEA, Chamomilla Recutita Flower Extract (Chamomile), Salvia Officinalis Extract (Clary Sage), Ascophyllum Nodosum Extract (Brown Algae), Cetrimonium Chloride, Vegetable Glycerin, Sodium PCA, Panthenol (Vitamin B5), Citric Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate Even though Aloe Vera and natural extracts dominate the ingredient list, a close look reveals active ingredients that are not any more natural than those used by most other brands. For example while they do avoid sodium laureth sulfate they use sodium myreth sulfate which just differs by a couple of carbon atoms. Likewise they contain the common conditioning agent cetrimonium chloride which is chemically processed and not generally considered to be very natural. It’s another case of a brand hiding standard ingredients behind a veil of natural goodies. The basic problem is that there’s no clear definition of what natural or organic means for a cosmetic product. Jail time for Jason Natural? Even the companies that make these products can’t agree on these definitions. Case in point, one maker of organic soaps is suing jason Naturals and a few other companies over the definition of organic. David Bronner, president of Dr Bronner’s Magic Soaps, claims that Jason Naturals and other brands are “composed of conventional rather than organic cleansing and moisturizing ingredients, with organic ingredients or extracts added for and ‘organic greenwash’.” According to Cosmeticsdesign , Bonner is asking that these companies not only stop selling their organic products (unless they meet USDA National Organic Program specifications) but he also wants them to pay him damages because their “fake” organic products are hurting the sales of his “authentic” ones.

"The Beauty Brains","","Flat iron or relaxing: which damages your hair more? by The Beauty Brains Monica questions : What causes more hair loss straightening you hair with a flat iron or doing a relaxer at a salon? Left Brain straighteners her out : Great question Monica. A quick answer is that Relaxers lead to more hair loss than Flat Irons. Read on for why. If you want some additional options to flat irons and relaxers take a look at this post we did on 7 ways to straighten hair . How Hair Straightening Processes Work While relaxers and flat irons can give you similar styles, they work in completely different ways. To understand how they work, you first must know that hair is made up of proteins. Within these proteins are chemical bonds responsible for hair strength & hair shape. The two most important types include Hydrogen bonds and Disulfide bonds. (There are others but Sarah’s eyes are starting to glaze over so I’ll stop there.) Hydrogen bonds are weaker, temporary and dependent on the amount of water in your hair. When you flat iron your hair, you remove curls/frizz by first mechanically forcing hair straight and then removing the water with heat. It works just like an iron on clothes. This locks hair into whatever shape it currently is in. It works great as long as your hair stays dry. But once hair picks up moisture from the air, it will start to revert to its more natural shape. Hair’s natural shape is controlled more by the Disulfide bonds. These permanent bonds don’t depend on how much water is in hair. With relaxers, hair’s disulfide bonds get broken down making your hair permanently straighter. At least permanent until new hair grows back. Both relaxing and flat ironing damage hair but relaxing is much worse because it actually degrades hair proteins. 3 Kinds of Hair Loss When you ask about hair loss you could be talking about 3 different kinds; breakage, natural, and permanent. Since I’m not sure which you’ve asked about, we’ll look at all three. Breakage : Everyone’s hair breaks to some extent, but damaged hair breaks more. Relaxing causes much more damage thus leading to more hair loss via breakage than flat irons. Natural : People shed just like dogs & cats. Your hair has a natural cycle where you lose about 100 hairs naturally each day. Neither relaxing or flat irons will affect this hair loss. You might notice more hair loss while flat ironing but that just because you pull out hairs that would have fallen out on their own. Permanent : In this type, hair stops growing at the roots & there is not much you can do to get it to come back. It’s unlikely that flat ironing will cause this but it is possible relaxing hair can. If your scalp is exposed to the chemicals in relaxers for too long, it can burn you and cause permanent hair loss. This isn’t a problem when relaxing is done by a top notch, professional stylist but if you have an amateur, look out! For more, see this information from the FDA about hair relaxer safety . Should You Relax? Despite the safety concerns and extra damage, there are some significant advantages of relaxing over flat iron straightening. These include More permanent Easier to do (if you have a stylist) More consistent results Less prone to negative humidity effects On the other had, being more permanent might be a negative to some. The Beauty Brains Bottom line: Both relaxing and flat ironing damage hair, but relaxing is much worse. However, it does give some added benefits so you might decide hair relaxing is worth extra damage. If you don’t want to lose or damage hair, the best thing you can do is shampoo infrequently, condition each time, and don’t comb or style it much. Of course, that severely limits the type of looks you can get so these aren’t options for most people. What do YOU think? Would you rather have hair relaxed or do daily flat ironing?

"The Beauty Brains","","5 things you need to know about retin a by The Beauty Brains Beauty Bug begs an answer: I’m currently reading Free Gift with Purchase , by Jean Godfrey-June, the beauty editor for Lucky . The books says that Retin-A helps with wrinkles and Beauty Bug wants the Beauty Brains to comment. Does Retin-A really get rid of wrinkles? The Left Brain responds: What is Retin-A? Retin-A is the brand name of a prescription drug called Tretinoin which is a derivative of vitamin A. In 1971, the FDA approved the topical application of Tretinoin to treat acne and sun damaged skin. This drug works by irritating the skin, which triggers the basal layer to produce fresh skin cells, thus increasing cell turnover. (Mmmm, turnover!) As new cells more rapidly replace the old ones, the skin takes on a younger, smoother appearance. So it does work, but there are a few issues you should be aware of. 5 Things You Need to Know About Retin-A 1) It’s a prescription drug so you can only get it from your doctor. 2) It doesn’t work over night. Wrinkles start to decrease or disappear after three to six months. 3) Some of the drug is absorbed into the body and may cause problems with pregnancy. 4) It can be so irritating that it burns and causes redness. 5) While it does help reduce wrinkles that doesn’t mean it gets rid of ALL your wrinkles. As they say, results will vary. The Brains Bottom Line: Unlike so many wrinkle creams , this drug has been proven to really do something (despite the issues cited above.) And don’t fall for the claims of other products that are really just regular cosmetics with Vitamin A derivatives.","5 things you need to know about retin a","2841d93a4295d45d5fc87ae4ce3c29405de2543a","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2007/03/5-things-you-need-to-know-about-retin-a/"
"The Beauty Brains","2014-03-17 19:44:00","5 tips for using baby wipes to remove makeup by The Beauty Brains Carmen’s question: I realize this is an icky revelation — but I frequently find myself too pooped at the end of the evening to properly wash my face. Sometimes I go to bed with my makeup still on, and I know that’s not good. I’m considering buying face wipes to at least take some of the grunge off before plunging into bed. But what about just using baby wipes? Aren’t they basically the same thing? They’re certainly cheaper! The Right Brain’s Pampered Response: Yes, Carmen, you can use baby wipes to remove makeup. Here are 5 things to think about before you baby your face: 1. Cost Wow, what a difference! The cost of an average Baby Wipe = 5.5 cents each. Cost of an average Make Up Remover = 33 cents each (For baby products we used the average cost of Tushies, Huggies, 7th Generation, and Pampers. For facial wipes we used Almay, Neutrogena, Chorane, and Comodynes facial wipes. Anyway you slice it, “baby” is cheaper.) 2. Cleansing ingredients All the formulas we looked at (both baby and make up) use mild cleansers – nary a sulfate in sight. However, keep in mind that baby wipes are not built to remove the kind of heavy, waxy buildup you get with lipstick or some waterproof mascaras. (Then again, not everyone wears water proof mascara. Just to be safe, if you plan on removing eye make up, you should check with the manufacturer.) Based on looking at the formulas, it appears that the cleansing power varies by brand. Tushies, for example, appears to be very light cleansing. 3. Quality of the cloth The texture of facial cloths and baby wipes are similar, but you might find the baby wipes are a bit big for facial use. (As with so many things in life, size does matter.) But that’s ok, folding isn’t against the law. Also, depending on the brand, you might find the baby wipes are too wet for your face. 4. Safe for skin A hallmark of any good make up (or make up remover) is that it’s proven to be noncomedogenic. In other words, it doesn’t cause comedones, or black heads. We’ve never seen a baby wipe that makes this claim but it’s probably not a big deal. Oils are the types of ingredients that usually cause comedones and the baby wipe formulas we looked at don’t seem to contain a lot of those kind of ingredients. 5. Fragrance If you use baby wipes to clean your face, you’ll probably find yourself smelling like baby lotion. But that’s not necessarily a bad thing, especially if you’re trying send a subliminal message to your husband/significant other. If you catch our drift. Of course, you can also buy the unscented variety. If you’re still not convinced you should use baby wipes, you can always buy some Almay Eye Makeup Remover pads here.","5 tips for using baby wipes to remove makeup","04317842561f03661707948c96ea7de5bbd265c0","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2007/08/5-tips-for-using-baby-wipes-to-remove-makeup/"

For safety reasons, you should throw away any of these products if they are more than 6 months old. While this formula is different than standard ones, that doesn’t mean it is worse. Standard shampoo formulas probably clean too well anyway and foaming is overrated. Manufacturers make shampoos that give lots of foam but it is only done because consumers think more foam = better. This isn’t true since you can make a terrible shampoo that foams great. The Beauty Brains bottom line All the other Burt’s Bees formulas have a similar theme. They definitely make formulas that are unconventional using non-standard ingredients. In most cases, they are not going to perform as well as the more “high tech” products you can buy in your local drugstore, but they might just be good enough. And if the idea of “natural” products is more appealing to you than “the best functioning” products, then try them for yourself and you decide.","Beauty product review: The buzz on burt’s bees","979f11463f220f35fb0b770bc5d05d3896daa8be","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2009/12/beauty-product-review-the-buzz-on-burts-bees/"
"The Beauty Brains","","How does estee lauder Idealist work? by The Beauty Brains Rosabella’s request… A friend of mine swears by Estée Lauder’s Idealist to make her pores look smaller. So do a lot of people online whose reactions and reviews I’ve read, but a lot of them can’t get over the price. Neither can I! Do you know what’s so special about the formula? Do you reckon it works? The Right Brain responds: According to Lauder’s website Idealist contains “Pore Diminishing Technology” that “makes enlarged pores look virtually invisible by treating their appearance from the inside out…to dissolve away pore-clogging debris.” The website goes on to site three specific ingredients that make up this technology: How Idealist works 1. The powerful anti-oxidant NDGA helps shrink the look of enlarged pores by helping reduce the visible irritation that can lead to a build-up of excess oil deep within pores. 2. Gentle-acting Chestnut Extract helps free your skin from dry, dulling, flaky skin cells. 3. Glucosamine (a sugar-derived, non-acid refinisher)… loosens the bonds that bind dead, dulling and flaky cells to your skins surface. For the sake of thoroughness we’ll include the complete ingredient listing: Idealist Ingredients Purified Water, Dimethicone, Polysilocone-11, Cyclomethicone, Sodium Lactobionate, Isopentyldiol, Acrylamide/Sodium Acryloyldie-thyltaurate Copolymer, Green Tea (Camellia Sinensis) Extract, Laminaria Saccharina Extract, Wheat (Triticum Vulgare) Germ Extract, Barely (Hordeum Vulgare) Extract, Sodium Glycyrrhetinate, Modified Polysaccharides, Sclareolide, Whey Protein (Lactis Proteinum), Saxifraga Sarmentose Extract, Grape (Vitis Vinifera) Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate, Mulberry (Morus Nigra) Root Extract, Cholesterol, Caffeine, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Acetyl Glycosamine, Sodium Hyaluronate, Pantethine, Acryldimethyltauramide Copolymer, Phenyl Trimethicone, Lavender (Lavandula Angustifolia), Glycerin, Soidum Carbomer, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Grapefruit California (Citrus Grandis), Polyethylene, Polysorbate 20, Soidum Acrylodimethyl Taurate, Squalane, Butylene Glycol, Floralozone, Polysorbate 80, Methyldihydrojasmonate, Isohexadecane, Coriander (Coriandrum Sativum), Phenoxyethanol, Imidazolidinyl Urea, Methylparaben, Ethylparaben, Propylparaben, Butylparaben, MICA, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Iron Oxides (CI 77491, CI 77492, CI 77499) {ILN17378}. How does Idealist work? At least one of these key ingredients, Glucosamine, has been shown to have efficacy in testing published in a peer reviewed journal. (See Pubmed reference .) Researchers (from Estee Lauder) found that this sugary material can help keep pores clean because it has similar effects to alpha hydroxy acids. Since debris from skin cells is one of the causes of enlarged pores, it makes sense that loosening dead skin cells could help diminish how big they appear. I’m still skeptical, but at least there is some real science behind what the product says it will do. However, the degree to which the product delivers what it promises is highly subjective. Idealist claims to make “pores appear 1/3 smaller—instantly” and that you’ll “see a 69% reduction in the look of pores in just 4 weeks.” You’ll notice that these claims are all about the “look” of the pores. That means Lauder has some kind of perception data – they had women used the product and they asked them to rate the appearance of their pores. Just because they noticed a statistical difference doesn’t mean you’ll be satisfied with the degree of improvement. And unfortunately, it will cost you $46 for 1 ounce of product to find out for sure. Have YOU tried Idealist?

"The Beauty Brains","","Is SPF lotion safe to mix? by The Beauty Brains Kim Ray’s question… I was wondering if mixing equal parts of sunscreen with lotion would yield the same benefit as applying both separately. I want the higher SPF of actual sunscreen and the stronger moisturizer of the lotion. It is really hard to find a product that delivers on both. The Right Brain responds: We appreciate how tough it is to find SPF lotions that strike the right balance of moisturization and protection but we don’t recommend that you mix sunscreens with lotion. Here’s why… Two reasons not to mix SPF lotion First, as we pointed out in our post on The Wrong Way to Apply Sunscreen , certain ingredients that are commonly used in skin care products can interfere with the way UV absorbers deposit/spread on the skin. The last thing you want to do is compromise the performance of the active ingredient in a sunscreen. Not only are you wasting money but more importantly you’re increasing your risk of sunburn or worse! Second, as Vananners pointed out in our Forum , if you mix an SPF lotion with a non-sunscreen product you’re essentially diluting the sunscreen. So if you mix your products 50/50 you’d have to use twice as much of the mixture to get the same protective effect. And that’s going to make your skin greasy feeling. The Beauty Brains bottom line We’d recommend you keep looking for a sunscreen that provides the right level of moisture for you. Does anyone out there in the Beauty Brains community have any suggestions for Kim Ray?","Is SPF lotion safe to mix?","098d5e8e04bcbad5f2e4aee3d598b3647070c8f9","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2009/07/is-spf-lotion-safe-to-mix/"
"The Beauty Brains","2014-10-18 07:10:00","Does My Acne Treatment Stop Working Over Time? by The Beauty Brains Jaune’s question… Is it possible that a skin product loses its efficacy after repetitive use or is it me? I have tried some soaps, scrubs and creams to help fight persistent acne scars on my face and other parts of my body. Some products worked wonders on my skin but after months of usage twice a day I didn’t notice anymore noticeable improvement/effect on my skin and I’m back to square one. Is it me or the products? The Right Brain’s reply: As you know if you’ve read our previous posts on what causes acne , there are three basic classes of topical active ingredients that are used to treat breakouts. And yes, some of them do “wear out” over time. Retinoids Retinoids are the class of ingredients that include Retin A® and other brand names like Avita®, Differin®, and Tazorac®. These are all chemically similar to vitamin A and they work by breaking up the mix of oil and dead skin cells that blocks your pores. It may take weeks for retinoids to work, so sometimes acne may get worse before it gets better. This may make it seem like Retin A products stop working over time, but that’s not really the case. You have to stick with them! Benzoyl peroxide Benzoyl peroxide (or BP) is one of the most famous acne medications. It kills bacteria by releasing oxygen. Bacteria can’t counter this effect so BP does not lose efficacy over time. In fact, it is used in combination with antibiotics (see below) to prevent bacteria from building up resistance. Betahydroxyacids These are solutions of weak acids like salicylic acid. They work by loosening the “glue” that holds skin cells together to the top layer of skin peels off faster. These helps open blocked follicles and helps prevent pores from getting clogged. Your body doesn’t get used to this effect so you can continue to use them over time as long as you don’t find them irritating. Topical antibiotics These are drugs, like erythromycin, clindamycin, and sulfa drugs, that kill the bacteria that cause acne. Because you rub these medications directly on acne lesions, they are more effective and less likely to cause side effects than if you took them orally. However, acne bacteria can “get used to” these drugs which makes them less effective over time. So if you’re using antibiotic treatment for acne you may find that they stop working over time. What do YOU use to keep your skin clear? Come out of the comedogenic closet and share your favorite acne products with the rest of the Beauty Brains community.

"The Beauty Brains","","Anti-Animal testing group agrees with the Beauty Brains by The Beauty Brains The Beauty Brains have discussed animal testing and cosmetics on a few occasions. Here they explained how all ingredients on cosmetics were at one time animal tested and how companies can claim not to test on animals when they indirectly do. A number of people have expressed skepticism about those claims. Well, according to this story , here is an anti-animal testing group from the UK that gets it right. Director Dr. Dan Lyons from the group, Uncaged, correctly points out that Consumers are being misled by the beauty companies, who claim they don’t test their products – but they still test the ingredients, or use a third party to do the testing for them Why some companies think it is ok to mislead people and claim they are better than other companies because they “don’t test on animals” is a mystery to this brain in training. –Mid Brain","Anti-Animal testing group agrees with the Beauty Brains","688911f66395b50635add349f54d0e7805678490","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2008/07/anti-animal-testing-group-agrees-with-the-beauty-brains/"
"Randy Schueller","2016-07-06 07:38:00","The cause of smelly hair syndrome by Randy Schueller Betty’s got a problem… Hello! I am so GLAD I found you! I have had this problem now for about 3 months. I wash and condition my hair on a daily basis and by the middle of the day my hair has a sweaty, muggy smell. I just can`t describe it, it just smells! Even worse when I`m running late in the morning and I am not able to wash my hair I could smell that sweaty, muggy smell throughout the day. I there anything I can do to stop this? The Beauty Brains respond: Betty, I had never heard of this problem before so I was surprised when I found out that you’re not the only one who suffers from hair malodor. A quick search turned up several discussion boards on smelly hair. There’s even a website that specializes in Smelly Hair. What Causes Smelly Hair? They claim the problem is a fungus that grows on oily scalps. That sounds plausible since the odor you describe as sweaty and muggy could be caused by microbial growth. I know that sometimes the towel I used to dry my hair develops a funky smell kind of like the one you describe. That happens when it doesn’t dry out completely, so I assume there`s some mildew or similar organism that responsible. If I don`t notice it right way, that mildew odor transfers from the towel to my hair. Could this be the cause of your problem too? What can you do about it? Smellyscalp.com says use an antimicrobial shampoo. That certainly could help. You can also try changing your towel and your pillow case. If that doesn’t work, you might try shaving your head, like Britney. (Just kidding!) You could also try using a product like the Stila hair refresher, but that will just cover up the odor. It won`t address the source of the problem. To save you time, we’ve complied the best information on the causes and cures for smelly hair and scalp that we could find.

(sorry but the formatting was destroyed when our website crashed.) Office Hair March 15, 2007 at 10:20 pm It’s awful, but it’s funny. Being a hairdresser I know how prevalent a smelly scalp is, but what I don’t understand is why don’t these people ask their hairdressers? It’s my responsibility to look after not only their hair, but their health if possible. Recommendations? I love Paul Mitchell’s Tea Tree Shampoo & Conditioner, feels good, smells good. Sillysil April 19, 2007 at 3:36 pm My 13 year old daughter has very oily hair. Poor thing can get out of the shower and her hair already has that yucky smell. I thought it was just hormnoes but now i’m worried. Any thoughts. Michele June 29, 2007 at 6:27 pm At the end of the day, my scalp has a sour odor to it. So washing it is the only way to get rid of it. Last week, I picked up a sample of DaddyO shampoo (for silver hair) at a Lush store in Seattle. Tried it. I never got the sour smelling scalp, even when I skipped shampooing the next day. I went back to my regular shampoo just to check if I was imagining it. Nope. The DaddyO acted like a deodorant. Amazing. I’m going to do some research on this. Roland August 31, 2007 at 10:43 pm I was researching this issue and found the following web site: SmellyScalp.com -who would have guessed? Check it out. They talk about using a sulfer soap. And claim it does the trick. Hope it helps! -RR South Carolina October 20, 2007 at 8:34 pm My daughter has the same problem as Sillysil’s. Her hair smells dirty straight out of the shower. So I got online and did some research and found out it is caused by a fungus. The treatment is to shampoo with a sulfur based shampoo. I read every label of every shampoo bottle at every store, and none of them list sulfur as an ingredient. The only shampoo I have found with sulfur is dog shampoo, and am a little reluctant to try it. I thought I’d take he to the doctor and see what he can prescribe. But if anyone out there is braver than I, good luck!!! Lorraine November 19, 2007 at 4:38 pm I tried the sulfur soap, and it works, but not consistently. It also made my head sweat PROFUSELY for no reason, so I stopped using it, and the sweating completely stopped, but I’m still stuck with smelly hair. michelle February 14, 2008 at 2:47 am i am a hairdresser and always shampoo my hair regularly,and i had this issue for months. almost drove me crazy.i decided to use dial antibacterial body wash for a week –gone ! give it a whirl Justin February 21, 2008 at 7:28 am hi guys. i followed the advice of a few different posters on the net. i had a smelly scalp, and it was quite bad. i could shower before sleep, and wake up with a smelly scalp and oily scalp. head and shoulders didn’t help. i got the paul mitchell tea tree shampoo, and saw results the next day. success for me! thanks! pookie February 26, 2008 at 12:20 pm I have the “sour scalp” syndrome, but it only happens every once and a while. I notice that anything with Tea Tree, Lavender, Rosemary, Mint, etc. helps a LOT. Giovanni Tea Tree Triple Treat is fantastic and a bit less drying than Paul Mitchell’s because Giovanni’s version DOES NOT HAVE SODIUM LAURLY SULFATE!!!! A virtual rarity among shampoos. They also make a conditioner. You can find it at Whole Foods and any good health food store. T-Sal by Neutrogena also works (Salicylic acid works well on any scalp problem) and if you just want to keep it simple, believe it or not, the new line that Head & Shoulders just introduced is pretty good. Try the Citrus formula. Susan March 3, 2008 at 10:58 am I’ve had scalp odor for years. I remember having extremely oily scalp and dandruff in the 5th grade. I’m now 36. I Read online that a guy had this odor and the only time it dissappeared was when he lived in a house with well water that had high sulfur content. Bar sulfur soap, not the liquid kind, is what works for me. I also avoid regular shampoos b/c of Sodium Lauryl sulfates. johnny April 4, 2008 at 7:25 pm I have notice a smell in my hair for about 6 months tried head and shoulders worked slightly saw my doctor he recommended hibicleanse you can find it at your local drug store for about ten dollars be cautious when using if it gets in you eyes it can really harm you but did work for me smell went away with one use Chrissy Clark May 28, 2008 at 9:19 pm OMG…. I never knew that other people had suffered like I did, I am sooo goin to try all the techniques I have read here, I am 26 and I have had “SMELLEY HAIR” since about 24, and it was so embarissing! Well Good Luck to all, and I will let u know how my experiences work!! tata jam May 30, 2008 at 8:34 pm this isnt a fungus in the scalp or hair related. its all to do with weak immune systems. how many of you with oily smelly scalp have been on any anti biotics? washing your hair with all these different shampoos and soaps will cover the smell, but not cure the underlying problem. it is a difficult treatment to undertake to cure, candida will require a drastic diet change, lots of healthy bacteria for stomach and products like threelac or candigone. i had the problem from 8 years old to 26. its not nice. Andy June 10, 2008 at 8:16 pm lol, Candida…I’m in a medical mycology and parasitology class at the UW (Washington), and one of the lecturers, before his section was over, ranted about the “candida” craze. A few people hyped it up to be a big problem and people started selling all sorts of stuff to get rid of candida. I guess they forgot to mention that Candida is ubiquitous and impossible to get rid of. There’s also poor association between Candida and the alleged ailments in immunocompetent people. I wouldn’t trust Jam’s speculation; it can’t be that everyone with a smelly scalp is immunocompromised. I have a smelly scalp and I have never been on anti-biotics because frankly I don’t get all that sick. clean June 16, 2008 at 8:51 pm Hi-I used to have an oily, smelly scalp for years and would wash my hair every day or every other day and the odor was so unbearable. I know my co-workers could smell it and I was so embarassed. There was actually a thick oily flour like substance on my scalp. Gross!!! I tried everything-tea tree oil on my scalp, baking soda, apple cidar vinegar, lemon, coconut oil, nutrogenas t-sal, shampoos without additives, sodium laurel sulfate, aloe, you name it, I did it. I had a feeling it might be candida and years ago I tried taking acidophilus, probiotics and still no change. What did help was not eating fried foods but it would only buy me couple more days without smell and then if I perspired, it would smell again. I hope that I will be able to help others because I was at such a loss. I accidently found the cure. That’s right, I said cure because I no longer have this oily scalp odor!!! And it I was cured right before the 3 days intense heatwave we had. I did not have a/c so it was nasty hot. But here it is. It is called Candidase and made by Enzymedica. You can get this in a healt food store. I took it because I have other symptoms but what I noticed after taking it for 3-5 days was that my scalp odor/itch problem just went away. I can’t even tell you if it was 3 days or 5 days because I had other issues that I was trying to take care of and then I just noticed that my scalp feels clean and it was 1 days of not washing. Then I waited one more day and nothing, no odor, no oil and then I realized that I had been taking this Candidaise. I’ve also been taking aloe for my digestion. I think that has been helping with my sinuses. I used to have constant dripping and congestion for years (10+). Always sound like I’m stuffed up and then after some time of taking the aloe it disappeared to. I think my immune system is finally getting stronger which is why some things I’ve tried before didn’t work but ow they are. I hope this helps some of you out there. I can’t make any guarantees, only want to share what has helped me with others. Please post and let me and others know if this helps anyone. Now I can go out and buy those great smelling shampoos and have some bit of confidence now. I finally feel clean now. dutchy July 13, 2008 at 6:58 pm clean i was wonder did Candidase cure ur hair odor, and will you think it will cure fecal scalpe odor? and aloe juice cure really cure ur nose problem?!! hit me up asap dutchy Sierra July 20, 2008 at 11:04 am Hi, Clean & everyone thank you so much for posting your comments. I’m so happy to know I’m not alone. I have had the same exact experience as clean and its been so horrible for me. I go to work everyday because I have no choice, my co-workers are very cruel to me because of the bad odor they smell coming from my head. But they don’t know how hard I try to take care of this problem. Anyways, I’m going to try Candidaise. I hope it works its my only hope. I will keep you updated. Its nice to know I’m not alone, you begin to feel like your the only one. Thanks so much! Phoenix July 22, 2008 at 8:02 pm Hello Like most of you, I feel grateful to have this blog. I have been having a problem with the smelly hair thing myself and it has been driving me crazy,I am a clean freak. I just went out and bought the Tea Tree shampoo and the Dial soap, they both contain sulfate. I will give it a week and get back with you. The funny thing is I have had issues with Candida since I was 12, So CLEAN might be on to something. It wouldnt surprise me at all. I will let you guys know what happens with the soaps. And yes it’s nice to know that there are others with this issue. Sheela August 12, 2008 at 12:08 am I would check out sites that explain a mite called demodex mites. Also a there is a site called borax cures. I’ve used sebulex,DHS shampoo and Soda water helps. I’ve had this for years and it took alot of research to find this info. Hope it helps. J August 26, 2008 at 3:13 am I agree, this is NOT just an external bacteria/fungal problem for most of us. I am at the end of my ropes, trying everything in site from antibacterial pills to apple vinegar on the hair. I’ve tried everything! T_T i don’t know what to do…I haven’t tried the candida yet…maybe i’ll give that a try before i just give up. Thank you, everyone, who have contributed to this forum. gijay August 28, 2008 at 8:52 pm I’M SO HAPPY TO KNOW I’M NOT A FREAK, I THOUGHT I WAS THE ONLY ONE TO HAVE THIS CONDITION, FOR THE EFFECTS THE DERMATOLOGISTS I’VE BEEN TO ARE NOT WELL RELATED TO THIS. gijay August 28, 2008 at 8:54 pm I’M GONNA TRY NEW THINGS TO SEE IF IT WORKS FOR ME, THANKS YOU GUYS smokey September 6, 2008 at 8:52 am Try taking a chlorophyll supplement. It’s an ‘internal deodorant’ that helps many types of body odors, from breath to feet. I’ve taken it for about 3 years and have noticed improvement in scalp odor and morning breath. Word of warning–start slowly and increase to recommended dosage. It does funny things to your bowel and you can have some pretty creepy poopies if you start all at once! LOL lulu September 10, 2008 at 7:59 pm I’ve also had problems with candida for years and have wondered if there is a connection. Does anyone else have hair loss/itch/bumpy scalp along with the odor problem? knowledge September 10, 2008 at 9:11 pm To Andy…your professor can rant all he wants about the candida craze, but he’s never been sick with it for 15 years. Dr. Crook, author of The Yeast Connection was a pioneer in bringing this finding in sooooooooooo many people forward. Europe has known about it for way over 75 years. The USA, with the pharmaceutical companies as their decision makers lord over the minds of medical schools. Plus everything must be measured by a blood sample. If it is not in a blood samble the lab says it doesn’t exist. This causes them to be narrow-minded concerning prevention, and they have no knowledge of nutrition. Countless histories have been made on people connecting the dots. Some candidas/funguses (virtually the same)are connected with parasites as well. Europe does not have a blind eye. Countless people, including myself, have taken 15 years to cure what antibiotics did to ruin their natural flora. Probiotics are good, but they don’t work until the yeast/candida/fungus is killed. For me, it took about 8 garlic gels a day to kill it off. Then the probiotics work. Yeast/candida/fungus exhibits itself in various ways. Doctors in the USA have caused it. They certainly don’t understand that there is such a thing as healthy bacteria that prevents illness, so they just kill all the good stuff. Any way for those of you who are interested in info, read the candida and yeast books. It will make a difference in your other symptoms as well. DREW! September 15, 2008 at 11:28 am It’s probably just AIDS. Relax. Patricia September 19, 2008 at 2:34 am Nice to have this website. I have had this problem- oily, smelly, head, since I became a teenager. Now age 65, with thinning hair; you can imagine how many products I have tried. The one thing that I used that worked, so I don’t have to shampoo every day, is antibacterial liquid hand soap, that I tried only when I ran out of shampoo in the shower. It worked for the smell. Now I am looking for other remedies, that might help my thinning hair too. I also use hair powder – a baby powder of corn starch to fill in the VERY thin spots on my head of white hair. It is not entirely satisfactory, but OK for now. Keeping thinking and sharing. Nikki October 7, 2008 at 10:47 pm I have the same problem. I’m still not 100% sure what it is or what causes it, but after doing some research my best guess is that it’s seborrheic dermatitis, which is mainly caused by a yeast called Malassezia furfur. It also may be caused by a lack of certain nutrients like biotin. I’ve tried everything to get rid of it. It’s a pretty embarrassing condition to have. Everyone who gets close to you can smell it, and it smells like you haven’t showered in a month. I tried Nizoral, Selsun Blue, T/Gel, other kinds of Neutrogena, Head & Shoulders, Denorex, pretty much every kind of medicated shampoo there is. I tried taking yeast supplements. I tried washing my hair more often or less often. I also tried herbal shampoos and tea tree oil. And if you tell people about your problem, they give you all kinds of bad advice like, “Why don’t you just wash your hair more?” Ugh. Not helpful. But anyways, I have an actual answer! The only thing I’ve tried that helps is sulfur shampoo. Sulfur shampoo is hard to find but you can order it on the internet. Sebulex is the more expensive brand, but there is also Sebex, which is kind of like a knock-off brand. I promise you this works. It worked for me and my mother (who has the same problem) and it worked the very first time we used it. I have been using it once a week for about a year and it’s still working. The problem is that if you stop using it the smell does come back. I’m also worried that if I use it too much it will stop working, so I try to use as little as possible. Hope that helps! Cris October 11, 2008 at 6:11 pm I have been suffering with smelly hair and was told by a FNP that I had seborrheic dermatitis, and that I should use Nizoral, which is really expensive. I tried that and it was better, but I still would get that smell less than 10 hours after washing my hair. After looking at all the entries, I just now (today!) went to a pet store and decided to try out some medicated antibacterial shampoo (pricey, $17). It IS for dogs and cats, but the ingredients are the same as those for human antibacterial shampoo. For the bacteria, it has triclosan, sulfur (2%) and it also has salicylic acid which is good because I have oily scalp. I’m familiar with all these ingredients (mostly used for acne) so I thought it’d be ok to use dog shampoo. I washed and dried my hair about 5 hours ago and so far so good. If it doesn’t work out as well as I think it will, I’ll post again… Good luck everyone. It IS nice to see that I’m not alone. It’s a very embarrasing problem to have, especially because people might think it’s a hygiene problem when it’s not at all. Chona October 17, 2008 at 10:06 pm hello everyone! thanks for all the tips. I have a similar problem but extra problems with the scalp and was wondering if anybody knows about it. My scalp has been smelly for at least 4 years. I wash my hair almost every day because my scalp gets sweaty easily, and with that comes the odor and oil on the scalp. I especially sweat at night. And for the last 8 months or so, i have noticed that my hair is thinning (I’m only 26 and female) I am wondering if mites can be the cause, or the constant washing. how would I find out? Dermatologists don’t seem to be a great help.. I’m otherwise healthy, eat healthy no medications, allergies or anything. Only on birth control (necon), which I don’t know could be the cause Amelia October 27, 2008 at 7:34 pm So I am sensing that it’s all to do with yeast somehow? smelly head November 14, 2008 at 8:06 am i have always had oily thin smelly hair. And im glad that Im not the only one. the truth is, besides the fact that it has to do with genetics, it is also a build up of yeast,(malazzeisis furfur),,seborrheic dermatitis and can only be controlled with certain shampoos. but you will always have it, it just needs to be controlled like acne. Karen November 21, 2008 at 5:46 pm Thanks for all of the great suggestions. I, too, had tried everything for the past couple of years, including the Sulfur Soap that I got from smellyscalp.com. I couldn’t get it to lather enough and it really dried out my hair. What works? I use a combination of: the generic equivalent of Neutrogena’s T-SAL shampoo, Sulfur Soap and Dial Antibacterial Body Wash with moisturizers. First, lather in a generous amount of the shampoo and rub in the sulphur soap. Leave it on for a few minutes, then rinse and wash with the body wash and leave that on a few more minutes. Spray on conditioner keeps my hair soft, but prevents my scalp from getting oily again. I am so relieved to have found a solution! greg November 29, 2008 at 10:44 pm I’ve had this problem for the past year… it is so frustrating! I’ve tried Selsun, H&S and Giovanna Tea Tree shampoo and conditioner with no luck. However, in the past few days I’ve been trying Tersaseptic ( http://www.stiefel.ca/tersaseptic.php?lang=1 ) and it seems to be working well!!! I highly recommend trying it. Good luck with this. Danny December 12, 2008 at 10:49 am Hi, LIke all the people on this page I suffer from smelly scalp. and I really mean suffer. I’ve had it for almost 15 years now, and have tried everything I could think off. Hundreds of different shampoos, soaps, pills etc. etc. Some appeared to have an effect, but two days later it would be just the same as before. I wash my hair every morning, but a few hours later it starts to smell. It’s awfull and effects my social life. THe last thing I tried is using vitamin K. For two days I was hopefull, but now the smell has returned. Susan December 17, 2008 at 7:13 pm I had very oily and a smelly scalp. I’ve tried every shampoo out there. Nothing worked. If it did, it smelled pretty badly. FINALLY, (everyone listen)I came across this shampoo that I have to let everyone know about. It’s called Follicleanse Clarifying Shampoo. IT’S THE BEST. After cleansing with this shampoo the smell is absolutely GONE!! Marie December 23, 2008 at 10:27 am I cannot believe that in all these years, no dermatologist has found a cure for this? I have had this condition for 6 years, and it’s strange, because I have no other symptoms, just a smelly scalp. For all you sulfur shampoo users out there: how bad does the sulfur smell? I want to try those shampoos, but I don’t want to smell worse because of it. I’m just tired of having to lather up everyday with 2 different shampoos and drying out my hair. I’m thinking of going to a dermatologist anyway and trying to use a prescription strength shampoo like Loprox. I’ll let you know if this works! Krystalyna December 28, 2008 at 6:41 pm Hi all, after months of researching about the scalp odor, I think I have found a shampoo that will work for all. It’s been highly recommended by someone and many claimed that it worked for them. It’s called: J/A/S/O/N Dandruff Shampoo. Unfortunately, it doesn’t come with a conditioner, so you’ll have to find one yourself w/o laureth/lauryl sulfate (bad ingredients!). A few people stopped using it due to the strong medicinal/sulfur smell it leaves after using, but if you find the right conditioner, it won’t be so noticeable. I plan on using that and using the Giovanni Tea Tree Triple Treat conditioner. If any of you plan on using it, I suggest using the product every other day for 2-3 months until you sense that the odor is gone/less noticeable. After those months, I then suggest using regular shampoos free of lauryl/laureth sulfates and then use the JASON Dandruff Shampoo once a week for maintenance. Hope this helps!!! Mom January 15, 2009 at 7:11 am My daughter has had smelly scalp/hair for about 3 years now. She is 10 years now. The only time it went away was when she stayed with her aunt and swam daily in her pool. I am sure the chlorine was the key. But I don’t know how to bottle and use that on anyone safely. Cindy Slater January 27, 2009 at 6:57 pm After suffering from this condition for almost 6 months now, I thought I was going insane. My hair smells like “moldy, wet hay” to me and I couldn’t get anyone to understand this. The question I have is whether anyone else suffers from any kind of bumps on their scalps, maybe from scratching so much? I constantly scratch and make my scalp bleed (I know, gross and embarrassing, but how much worse than smelly hair to start with?), so I figure this in itself would be enough to start an infection or fungus of some sort?? Anyway, I’m so appreciative to have found this site and will be trying several of the remedies listed to see what works for me. Will let you know. Katie Collett February 10, 2009 at 4:05 pm Susan, thank you!! My daughter’s hair is so crazy stinky also, no matter what we do…. and I think all these ideas do sound great. I was about to check w/ the dr & getting a prescription shampoo as a last resort… but I do not like drs as far as they are usually quite unhelpful, and I’d much rather find a more natural product, a healthier one, than chemicals and more junk. I really like the Follicle Shampoo idea… it’s right along the lines of what I was going for regarding health anyway. Super!! Thank you!! random guy February 14, 2009 at 6:50 am PLEASE HAVE ANY ONE OF YOU PERMANENTLY CURED THE SMELL I need to know because if no one has I will get a check up with my doctor, and if there is a cure I will post it! I know how it feels like I’m 12 and missing out on some valuable socializing time… tytytry February 19, 2009 at 1:10 pm Has anyone else tried “Follicleanse” apparently it gets rid of the smell! The description also looks promising check out this link: http://www.healthyhairplus.com/Follicleanse-Shampoo-p/hhphhfosh012.htm thanks! Deborah May 1, 2009 at 9:45 pm My husband often had an odor on his hair and neck and it use to really bother me. It was a sweaty kind of smell and very cloying. I noticed he only had the smell sometimes and not always. The smell also lingered in his bathroom and I would go crazy trying to clean it and get rid of the smell with every cleaning product we had. For awhile we thought our son might be the culprit, perhaps peeing in the corner of the bathroom by accident when we weren’t aware. However, one day after I ran out of shampoo, I borrowed my husband’s Head and Shoulders. The next day, I noticed the smell, this time on myself. We have tracked the smell down to his dandruff shampoo. Since then, we’ve thrown it out. My husband uses the Neutrogena TGEL instead and it doesn’t seem to have the same smell. It’s been a big relief to finally track it down and I’ve finally been able to tell my husband he smells knowing it’s not him, but the shampoo. Dudeley May 1, 2009 at 9:55 pm Folks. I suffered from this condition for probaly 13 years. Tried everything including sulfer soaps. All of the symtoms described here were mine – sour smell even after shampooing. It has been over five years now since I’ve had this, almost like a bad dream from the past. The trick for me? Someone suggested Dial anti bacterial body wash. I’m telling you, after a week of using this, it never came back. Good luck ya’all. Try it, only have $4 to lose if it doesn’t work for you. NJD May 6, 2009 at 3:50 pm I have smelly,oily, itchy scalp with grainy bits coming out of it. I don’t know of anyone with such a combination of problems. One thing I have come to establish after a lot of reading online is that shampoos which have conditioners in them will never help solve the smelly/oily hair syndrome and guess what, there are no anti dandruff shampoos void of conditioners(clear ones. I think I am going to try the Dial anti bacterial wash. Judy May 6, 2009 at 10:32 pm I have the same problem as NJD with the hardened sebum grains and the bad scalp odor. My daughter has it too and so did my father before he passed away. we think ry daughter picked it up from him by using his comb and l got it from her. I’ve been to the dermatologist and tried a lot of remedies – Loprox shampoo, t.Sal, selsun shampoos, Sulfur, vinegar, pyrethione zinc. Nothing works. l’m going w look into Candidase and FolliCleanse xhich I read abort in this thread. I’ll post results. Judy May 14, 2009 at 7:54 pm I’m shampooing /w baby shampoo, rinsing then shampooing /w hibiclens which I let sit for about 3-5 minutes. Then, I’m using a spray bottle filled /w 1/3 apple cider vinegar to 2/3 water. I spritz that on and rinse very lightly. I’m also using metrogel 1% on my scalp at night. I feel there is some improvement, but it’s too soon to tell. I’m still trying to find jojoba oil, because it’s supposed to dissolve the sebum. I didn’t say in last post that sometimes I get little bumps at the pore after the sebum grain pops out. These can worsen and feel like small painful blisters, but to look at them, they look pink, no head. Dr. cut one for lab diagnosis, and said it’s folliculitis, but they didnt do a culture. ugh. Has anyone experienced any of this, or have other advice? K Runner June 8, 2009 at 9:10 am I’ve had smelly hair for about two years now – smells dirty and “hairy” even after a regular shampoo, and my hats smell musty and “hairy” too. I’ve tried Nizoral with no luck (though it did help with dandruff). A friend sent me J/A/S/O/N dandruff shampoo (sulfur-based) and that seems to do the job! I am really happy that there is something that helps. The sulfur smell is pretty subtle – I’m a nurse and I’m really sensitive about controlling smells around my patients, so that was a big concern for me. My boyfriend says it’s subtle. Sometimes I use a mild conditioner with it, which helps with the slight sulfur smell. One problem is that if I don’t use the JASON shampoo at least every other day, the smell comes back. I think I’ll try the Dial soap and see if that helps… Good luck everyone, and keep sharing ideas so we can figure this out! Chris June 8, 2009 at 6:21 pm I think everyone should see their dermatologist so its brought to their attention and maybe, with all of us going to them with our problem they will find a cure! I have had it for about 5 months now and went to the dermatologist only to learn he knew nothing about it and just gave me some t-gel and nizoral samples to try. Needless to say, they didn’t work. The t-gel seemed to work..for maybe a week or so then right back to smelly! I’m in my 30′s…why is this happening now?

"The Beauty Brains","","5 ways to help others by donating hair by The Beauty Brains MCR asks: I’ve been trying to grow my hair out long so I can cut it and donate to Locks of Love in honor of my Mom. I need enough to donate at least 10 inches and have some left for me. (Or I could follow Brittany Spears lead & just shave it all off, then they would have plenty to make a wig.) Is there anything I can do to speed up my hair growth? The Right Brain dutifully responds: M, donating your hair in honor of your Mom is such a sweet idea! Unfortunately, there’s not much you can really do to impact the speed at which your hair grows. About the best you can do is take good care of the ends of your hair so you don’t need to trim them as you’re growing out to your ultimate length. So, you might find these Top 10 split end busters helpful. We wish you the best luck and we’d like to help educate other members of the Beauty Brains community with this list of 5 places where they can donate their hair for medical purposes. 5 Ways To Donate Hair 1. Locks of Love 2. Wigs for Kids 3. Pantene’s Great Lengths Program 4. Childhood Leukemia Foundation 5. Zichron Menachem Finally, a word of caution: not all charities are what they appear to be.

"The Beauty Brains","","Beauty q&a: Are my pores weird? by The Beauty Brains Anon asks… I have a follow-up question regarding the pore cleansing strips. Although I don’t use them too often AND I follow the directions on the box, I can’t really see the results. I mean, I use them when I think my nose needs it (I can actually see tiny black dots on my nose) but nothing comes out when I peel off the strip. Then I end up pressing my nose really hard to make them come out, which makes my nose red and swollen AND makes me sneeze. Are my strips not working or do I have weird pores?? The Right Brain thinks: That’s puzzling. The only thing we can think of is that you’re not applying the strips properly. The strips work by adhesion to your skin. If you have the strips too wet or too dry, they won’t stick very well and if they don’t stick they won’t work. The principle is pretty simple so it’s unlikely that your pores are the problem. What is a problem is the expense of the pore strips – if you have to keep experimenting to get them to work, you’re probably going to blow through a box pretty quickly. And even on sale, that could still cost you $8.99 for 14 strips! So while we urge you to try using them again with different levels of wetness, we realize it might be too costly. Now, if you’re still worried that your pores are weird, go read this . What do you think? Do pore strips really work for you?

"The Beauty Brains","None","Can Toothpaste Make You Fail a Breathalyzer Test? by The Beauty Brains Here’s an interesting news story from CosmeticsDesign.com about Massachusetts Senator Anthony Galluccio’s drunk driving arrest. The reason this caught the attention of my “beauty brain” is that the Senator claimed his that his toothpaste made him fail a breathalyzer test. Could this be true? Tipsy toothpaste The controversy centers around the ingredient sorbitol, a sugar alcohol which is used in toothpaste to provide sweetness and help maintain the water content of the paste. Galluccio regularly uses either Sensodyne Toothpaste and Colgate Total Whitening and reportedly a physician told him that these products could cause a positive breathalyzer result. However, James Herms, a formulator who helped develop Sensodyne formulas says that sorbitol ‘is not going to show up’ on a DOT-approved alcohol testing device. The only oral care ingredient likely to cause such an effect is ethyl alcohol, which is used in larger amounts in mouth washes. Joe Dwinell from the Boston Herald, the paper that broke this story, tested this theory by brushing his teeth with the same Sensodyne product and then taking a breathalyzer test. After only two minutes, the results showed no trace of alcohol. While this certainly isn’t a scientifically rigorous test, the “sorbitol defense” certainly sounds like BS to me. What do YOU think? Does this sound like beauty science or BS to you?

"The Beauty Brains","","Is clinique liquid facial soap worth the money? by The Beauty Brains Cee Cee says… I usually wash my face with the cheaper drug store brands but my friends swear by the more expensive Clinique Liquid Facial Soap. Is there something about this product that makes it worth the extra money? The Right Brain replies: Clinique Liquid Facial Soap (which sells for $18.00 sells for 6.7 ounces) is formulated with sodium laureth sulfate, a milder cousin of sodium lauryl sulfate, as the primary cleansing agent. It also contains seven or eight additional secondary cleansers and conditioning agents. Here’s the ingredient list if you want to make a full comparision. Clinique Liquid Facial Soap ingredients Water purified, sodium laureth sulfate, sodium chloride, cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine, lauramidopropyl betaine, sodium cocoyl sarcosinate, TEA-cocoyl glutamate, di-PPG-2 myreth-10 adipate, aloe barbadensis leaf juice, PEG-120 methyl glucose dioleate, sucrose, sodium hyaluronate, cetyl triethylmonium dimethicone PEG-8 succinate, tocopheryl ethyl succinate ethyldimonium ethosulfate, butylene glycol, matricaria, hexylene glycol, polyquaternium-7, laureth 2, caprylyl glycol, sodium sulfate, EDTA, disodium EDTA, sodium benzoate, phenoxyethanol. Are there other products that are cheaper? Sure. Freeman, for example, has a simpler primary surfactant and it’s about half the cost. Freeman Foaming Facial Cleanser Ingredients Water, Glycerin, Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Seed Butter, Chamomila Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Witch Hazel Extract, Camellia Oleifera Leaf Extract, Rice Extract, Punica Granatum Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Grape Seed Oil, Panthenol, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Cocamidopropyl PG Dimonium Chloride Phosphate, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Cocoyl Glutamate, Disodium EDTA, Butylene Glycol, Methylchloroisothiazoline, Methylisothiazolinone, Limonene, Linalcol, Fragrance While the Freeman product contains multiple natural extracts, it’s cleansing system is not as sophisticated as Clinique’s. Plus, it contains fragrance which is a no-no for products designed for sensitive skin. Finally, Freeman’s packaging is not as upscale as Clinique’s shiny chrome pump and frosted bottle. So with Clinique you’re not only paying for a more sophisticated formula but also the aesthetics and style of the Clinique name. The Beauty Brains bottom line Clinique is a very well formulated and nicely packaged product even though it may be a bit expensive for some people. The good news is there are plenty of other alternatives. As always, we suggest you experiment with a few different products to determine what’s right for your skin. You don’t have to buy a more expensive product just because your friends tell you it’s better. What do YOU look for in a facial cleanser? Mildness? How well it moisturizes your skin? Or just how well it gets rid of makeup?

"The Beauty Brains","","Are hand sanitizers bad for nails? by The Beauty Brains Michelle’s concern… I’m freaked out about getting the piggy flu so I use a hand sanitizer like 10 times a day. Now my nails look like crap. Is there a connection? The Left Brain responds: Yes, Michelle, hand sanitizers are effective against germs but they can have a negative effect on your skin and nails. Sanitizer insanity One of the Beauty Brains’ favorite resources is North Carolina dermatologist Dr. Zoe Draelos. In a recent article in the Dermatology Times , Dr. Draelos talks about the damage that waterless sanitizers can do to your hands. In fact, she claims that they are the biggest cause of increased brittle nails. That’s because nails need some level of water content to allow the keratin protein to flex and bend when deformed. But the alcohol in these products strips nails of moisture, thus leaving them more susceptible to breakage. And the danger isn’t limited to sanitizers – over applying highly fragranced hand lotions can cause the same problem. Nourishing nails Dr. Draelos suggests hydrating nails with lotions that contain urea and lactic acid. These two ingredients soften the nail somewhat and allow it to absorb more water. Be careful not to over-apply these products because too much can actually weaken the nail and make the problem worse. She concludes the article with these six tips: Reduce waterless hand sanitizers Don’t over apply hand lotions Wear gloves when using cleaning products that contain solvents like Formula 409 or Windex Don’t soak your nails Use protective nail polish Moisturize nails at night with urea or lactic acid cream Do you have any nourishing nail tips?

"Perry Romanowski","","If you want to be a cosmetic chemist here is what you do by Perry Romanowski Heather hopes the Brains can help : Hi, I’m currently looking in to Cosmetic Science as a career. I will be graduating from uni this year but have no previous experience in the area. I plan to do a diploma from the SCS in Cosmetic Science to start me off. If you have any advice or information I’d be very grateful. Thank you! Sign up to get a free course in cosmetic science . The Beauty Brains respond: Heather, how wonderful that you want to enter cosmetic science. This industry, and science based industries in general, need more women. I have always found it amusing/appalling to hear non-make-up wearing, bald men men in our industry blab on about exactly what women want. Ha! We often get asked this and similar questions about becoming a cosmetic scientist on the Beauty Brains so we’ll provide a general answer here. Hopefully, some of this information helps you. Key Moves to Become a Cosmetic Scientist 1. Get a science degree . Unless you have a relative who started the company, you will need a college degree in science since most cosmetic firms require it. Preferred ones include degrees in Chemistry or Chemical Engineering. However, plenty of scientists in our industry have Biology, Microbiology, and even Physics degrees. The specific college or Uni that you attend is less important than which degree you received. 2. Consider getting an advanced degree . True, a 4-year college degree is all you need, but you can improve your chances of breaking into cosmetics by getting an advanced degree. Your involvement with the SCS is a great start in the UK. In the United States, there are only a few advanced degrees offered. These include places like the University of Cincinnati, St. John’s University, Rutgers University, University of Southern California, etc. Check the college’s Pharmacy departments for more information. You can contact the Society of Cosmetic Chemists (SCC) for a complete list. In addition to getting something good for putting on your resume, you’ll get invaluable experience making cosmetic products & meet some great people. 3. Find the companies where you’d like to work . This industry has thousands of companies that employ cosmetic chemists. Where do you find them? If you like, internet searches work, but you can also search trade magazines like Happi or GCI . In GCI, your search can be done by region of the US or world. Of course, you can also look at what company makes a product you like and Google their contact information to inquire about jobs. 4. Figure out what job you want . Speaking of jobs, many different different ones exist in the cosmetic industry for scientists. If you actually want to make formulas, you’ll want a formulating job. People who enjoyed experiments in Organic Chemistry might like these jobs. If you were more interested in Analytical Chemistry than you’ll want to find a job in an analytical lab. You can also find jobs in microbiology, perfumery, and quality control. For chemical engineers, your job search can lead you to process engineering which requires you to figure out how you might scale 1kg batches up to 10,000 kg tanks. Finally, if all else fails you can get a sales job. Raw material suppliers always look for people with technical backgrounds who can sell product. Personally, I think formulating jobs rule! 5. Find a temporary assignment . If it is too difficult to break directly into the industry, you might try finding a job through a temp agency. These companies can place you at big cosmetic companies like P&G or Unilever for a short or longer term assignment. Many people get hired on permanently at companies after starting as a temp. 6. Network with other cosmetic chemists . If you really want to step ahead of the other cosmetic science job seekers, strike up relationships with other scientists that already work on cosmetics. The most popular US association is the SCC and in the UK it is the SCS. For other countries you can contact the IFSCC to find out your local organization. The SCC has chapters throughout the US and you can often visit a monthly meeting for free. There you can meet the most famous cosmetic chemist . If you prefer computers, look on LinkedIn , Facebook or MySpace for chemists who list their affiliation. You can even join our Beauty Brains Forum and get connected with other cosmetic chemists. Cosmetic science is a rewarding career which enables you to create and use almost any cosmetic or personal care product you want. Better living through chemistry. I love it! If you want to learn more about starting a career as a cosmetic chemist, be sure to sign up for this free 4-part course on cosmetic science .","If you want to be a cosmetic chemist here is what you do","d035516870d932d86af3f8b65b789b630fcfe278","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2008/07/if-you-want-to-be-a-cosmetic-chemist-here-is-what-you-do/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Is Kohl Eyeliner Dangerous? by The Beauty Brains Anna asks about kohl eyeliners. Not the modern kohl eyeliners you see in drugstores, but the kind known as kajal or sirma that women in Egypt and Asia use. She likes that these products are supposed to aid against eye diseases and are good for the skin near the eye. However, she’s heard that real kohl eyeliners can contain potentially dangerous levels of lead? Is this true? And is there anyway to tell if the brands that I like are safe or not? The Right Brain replies: Kohl is a mixture of soot and minerals that has been used for centuries to darken the area around the eye. Interestingly, some cultures believe that kohl should be used on children to help ward off evil spirits. It is also supposedly a good tooth whitener . (Kohl! It’s an eyeliner! It’s a tooth whitener! It’s a dessert topping!) Can Kohl Kill You? But seriously, we’re not making fun of the cultures that use kohl, but as scientists we are concerned about using dangerous cosmetic ingredients. And kohl can indeed be dangerous – some brands have been proven to contain high levels of lead because they`re made with galena (lead sulfate) or similar compounds. In fact, in January 2007, the state of Maryland banned the Hashmi brand of kohl because they claimed it contributed to lead poisoning in children. Unfortunately, there’s no easy way to tell if any given product is contaminated with lead or not. The Brains Bottom Line: Stay away from kohl products because there is a real risk of lead exposure. Use a regular eyeliner like Maybelline or E.L.F. if you want to darken your eyes and ask your doctor if you`re concerned about eye diseases.","Is Kohl Eyeliner Dangerous?","a71a86efbe4258e803889bbcaa6e39b2dbb43e79","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2007/03/is-kohl-eyeliner-dangerous/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Is sulfate free baby shampoo good for adult hair? by The Beauty Brains Shiraune Says : In viewing your site I have become an instant fan. I appreciate the unbiased information you provide here. My question is: are baby shampoos sufficient enough to clean adult hair? I know they are SLS free and have been looking for this type of shampoo to minimize the drying effect from SLS poos. The Left Brain Responds: Thanks for the kind words about the blog. We always try to provide helpful, unbiased information when answering your questions. And your question in particular is a good one because there is a lot of misinformation out there about Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS) and shampoo. Is SLS bad? First of all, don’t believe all the urban legends about SLS causing cancer or being bad for you because it’s used in garage cleaners. We’ve blogged about SLS before and pointed out that these myths have been debunked. Most people can use Sodium Lauryl Sulfate or Ammonium Lauryl Sulfate shampoos without any problem whatsoever. BUT, some people do find that SLS can dry out their scalp. Those people should consider SLS’s milder cousin SLES (short for Sodium Lauryl Ether Sulfate) or they should consider using sulfate-free shampoos. Are baby shampoos good cleansers? Baby shampoos are good examples of sulfate-free formulas. Instead of SLS they contain materials known as amphoteric surfactants that are less drying to skin and milder to the eye. (Hence the “no more tears” claim of many baby shampoos. The downside to these types of formulations is that they don’t clean as well as the stronger detergent systems. While SLS is a VERY good cleansing agent that can remove sweat, dirt, styling product residue and scalp oils, baby shampoo formulas are not so effective. Why not baby yourself? Is this a problem? It depends. If you’re using a ton of styling product you might have to shampoo your hair multiple times with baby shampoo to get it as clean as an SLS-based product. That’s not such a bad trade off if your scalp is really dried out. I recommend trying baby shampoo for a week or two to see if you like the effect. If not, you can always switch back.

"The Beauty Brains","","Why Do Perfume and Body Spray Smell Different On You? by The Beauty Brains Neveen needs to know… I know a girl who wears exactly my same perfume (actually my body spray). You can tell she’s been there from how the place smells afterwards. So why doesn’t my perfume last long enough to be in my own room? Is there some sort of “way” to apply body spray or is it just skin types? The Right Brain responds: As Jami and EKD45 pointed out in our Forum , there could be several answers to your puzzling perfume question. The dose does it From your question, the problem could be simply a difference in fragrance intensity. If that’s the case, it could be the dose. If she’s applying a lot more it’s logical that there will be more residue when she leaves the room. Concentrate on concentration The type of fragrance is also important. Many brands make a “body spray” scent that’s a diluted version of the pure perfume. So two people could both be wearing Marc Jacobs Daisy but if one is wearing the perfume and other the body spray or cologne, you could smell could different. Olfactory oddness Fragrances are notoriously unstable over time – especially if they are exposed to light or heat. If you just bought a new bottle of Vera Wang Princess and she’s just spritzed some on from a bottle that was in the trunk of her car all summer, you might not smell the same. Site of the scent Just like in real estate, location matters for fragrance. If you apply a scent to your pulse points, and other warm parts of your body, the fragrance will volatilize faster and smell stronger. Perfume that’s applied to cooler areas, like your hair or your sweater, may smell a little weaker. Befuddling body odor As Jamie said in the Forum your personal body chemistry could be a fragrance factor as well. Although we’ve never seen any specific research proving this, it does make sense that your body chemistry can affect fragrance. We see that effect all the time in formulating – the same fragrance oil will bloom differently in different bases. That’s because the chemicals in a shampoo or a skin lotion interact with the chemicals in the fragrance making the scent change, sometimes dramatically. In theory, the same mechanism could be happening on your skin. What do YOU think? Have you noticed that perfumes changes on different people? Do you have a favorite fragrance that you can’t wear because it doesn’t smell right on you?

"The Beauty Brains","None","How can you clean makeup brushes? by The Beauty Brains Carrie’s Curious About Cleaning: I am an aspiring makeup artist and I’m wondering what the best way to clean and disinfect my makeup brushes would be. In Cosmetology school we used Quaternary Ammonium Compounds to disinfect hair brushes but how can I disinfect brushes I use on the face? If you have any great ideas let me know. I want to protect my clients as best as I can. The Right Brain brushes up on cleansing: Thanks for the question Carrie. Unfortunately, there’s not a simple answer. In reality, there are many disinfecting chemicals available – the Quaternary Ammonium Compounds (called Quats for short) are one of the most common. But when you become a professional make up artist, you’ll need to make sure you’re following the local state regulations for cosmetologists and those regulations usually specify some kind of sanitization protocol for brushes. You should be able to find out more by doing a web search for the state you’re in. (You’re probably in a state of confusion at this point!) Now, having said all that, we can steer you toward a couple of not-necessarily-approved-by-state-regulatory-agency methods for cleaning make up brushes: 3 ways to clean makeup brushes 1) The Colorescience Brush company says this about their brush cleaner: “This pharmaceutical grade aromatherapy spray gently cleans make up brushes with natural ingredients. Its alcohol and hydrogen peroxide formulation helps purify and quick dry your Colorescience brushes.” 2) A manufacturer of squirrel hair brushes (no, we’re not making this up) recommends the following: “There are many brush cleaners available. Two excellent brands worth mentioning are Masters Brush Cleaner & Preserver and “Pink Soap” Artist Brush Cleaner and Conditioner. They both clean and rinse out very well. Moreover, they help condition your makeup brush hair. They are available at any good art supply store.” The Beauty Brain’s attorneys won’t let us comment on the viability of using art supplies to clean your make up brushes, but hey, if it’s good enough for squirrels… But seriously, you should check out their website just to see their instructions on how to clean and dry brushes – they’ve got some good tips. 3) Finally, here’s a tip from a consumer at one of our fave sites, Smartskincare.com : “After cleansing your face in the morning, you are more than likely spreading bacteria back on your face when you apply make-up with a brush. Makeup brushes are breeding grounds for bacteria. To help keep my brushes clean after each use, I simply wipe each brush back and forth over an inexpensive anti-bacterial wet wipe before putting them away. (You can actually see the makeup and blush residue deposited on the wipe!) Your brushes will be dry in about 3 minutes and stay much cleaner in between washings. This helps to keep breakouts to a minimum.” Interesting. We’re not sure if this is scientifically valid, but interesting. The Beauty Brains bottom line: To be honest, we’re not really experts in brush cleaning. But there are a lot of products out there so we suggest you check with a local beauty school for their recommendations. What do YOU think?

"The Beauty Brains","","How to clean your hair with conditioner by The Beauty Brains Nina asks about WEN, a line of cleansing conditioners created by a Hollywood hair stylist Chaz Dean . Dean believes that sulfates in most shampoos can be very damaging and stripping to hair so he created these cleansing conditioners to clean hair without stripping it. Nina wants to know if hair can really be better off in the long run by cleansing with a conditioner. And if it does work, will a regular drugstore conditioner produce the same effect. The Left Brain replies: Great question, Nina. First of all, the idea of cleaning your hair with conditioner is not new and was not invented by Chaz. And no, he’s not using any kind of revolutionary technology. Let`s take a look at the ingredients: Water, glycerin, cetyl alcohol, rosemary leaf extract, wild cherry fruit extract, fig extract, chamomile extract, marigold flower extract, behentrimonium methosulfate, cetearyl alcohol, stearamidopropyl dimethylamine, amodimethicone, hydrolized wheat protein, polysorbate 60, panthenol, menthol, sweet almond oil, PEG-60 almond glycerides, methylisothiazolinone, methylchloroisothiazolinone, citric acid, essential oils. Looking at just the functional ingredients (leaving out extracts, preservatives, pH adjusters, ) leaves the following: glycerin, cetyl alcohol, behentrimonium methosulfate, cetearyl alcohol, stearamidopropyl dimethylamine (SADMA), and amodimethicone These are very common conditioner ingredients. Here’s what they do: Glycerin can provide moisturization in a leave on product, but it doesn’t do anything for hair when it’s rinsed out. Cetyl and cetearyl alcohol are thickening and emulsifying agents are are used to make a conditioner rich and creamy. Because they`re oil soluble they could, in theory, help lift some of the sebum of your hair and scalp. Behentrimonium methosulfate, SADMA, and amodimethicone are very effective conditioning ingredients because they deposit on the hair. Could you clean your hair with this product? Sure, if your hair isn’t very dirty this could work pretty well. But so could any basic conditioner. In fact, I’d look for a conditioner that doesn’t have any silicone in it, just to make sure it leaves as little on your hair as possible. But what if you have greasy hair, or if you use hairspray, mousse gel, or putty? Then cleansing conditioners are not a very good idea. They don`t have enough cleansing power to remove gunk from the hair. Chances are that cleansing with conditioner will leave your hair feeling dirty and weighed down. The Brains Bottom Line: If you’re really worried about drying your hair out from over-shampooing, there’s nothing wrong with skipping your shampoo and just rinsing with conditioner once in a while. But you don’t need to spend $28 on a special product. A nice inexpensive drug store brand will do the same thing.","How to clean your hair with conditioner","1acf4de5333d87bc349c5fe43ac46bb6beee1b0d","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2007/03/how-to-clean-your-hair-with-conditioner/"
"The Beauty Brains","None","Top 3 skin lightening ingredients by The Beauty Brains Want to try Skin Lightening Forever? Click Here Mary Anne Murmurs: Do you think buying high-priced products that claim to diminish sun/age spots are any better than the drugstore kind (like Olay’s?) The Right Brain Roars: Dark spots have a number of causes. For example, there’s the kind you get from acne scars. These are tough to get rid of! Then there’s the kind you get from sun exposure. Sunlight increases melanin production, the natural pigment in your skin that gives you a sun tan. Sometimes your melanin kicks into over drive and you end up with dark spots. Products that block this reaction can make your skin lighter. There are 3 basic types of skin lightening ingredients: 1. Hydroquinone Proven to be the most effective ingredient but also the most controversial. Due to safety concerns, some countries have banned this ingredient. You can still find it in a number of products sold at different prices. For example, you can buy Black and White Bleaching Cream for only $12.00. 2. N-acetyl glucosamine As we discussed in our post on Olay Definity , this glucosamine derivative has been proven to work in clinical trials. It’s less effective than hydroquinone, but it doesn’t have the same risks. How well it works will vary from person to person, but it’s priced low enough to give it a try. You can buy Olay Definity here for around $20.00. 3. Kojic acid and alpha-arbutin We’ve blogged about these ingredients before ; they’re used in products such as Meladerm . It’s a bit more expensive (around $50.00), but a number of our community have reported good results with Meladerm . You can buy Meladerm here . And remember, using a sunscreen is a pretty good way to prevent dark spots from forming in the first place.","Top 3 skin lightening ingredients","4217d1dd89e111244596404064e1d3eed37992de","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2007/08/top-3-skin-lightening-ingredients/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Beauty Q&A: Are shampoos for colored hair different than regular shampoos? by The Beauty Brains Arlene Asks… I have been noticing lately that shampoos are made for different hair colors. Such as John Frieda and Pantene Pro-V Expressions. How are these shampoos any different from regular shampoos and do they really work? The Right Brain’s Rapidly Written Response: The trend toward different shampoo formulas for different hair colors appears to be entirely marketing driven. We have not seen any shampoo technology that is better for one color versus another. Color confusion The major manufacturers, Frieda and Pantene included, are taking their state of the art shampoo formulas and adding a bit of dye to them to correspond to the hair color they are marketing toward. If it’s a Bleach Blonde product, they add a little yellow dye. If it’s Pantene Expressions for Brunettes they add a brown or reddish brown. Read the claims carefully – most of these products don’t claim to ADD any color to your hair. They just say things like “Helps enhance depth and richness for multi-dimensional shine.” And that much is true, these products will keep your hair color looking deep and rich by virtue of the fact that they are proving some conditioning to the hair which keeps the hair looking and feeling better. But these formulas do NOT make the color darker or last longer – if nothing else, your roots will still grow out at the same rate. The Beauty Brains bottom line: Both of these manufacturers make high quality products that can make your hair better but don’t buy them because you think they’ll make your hair color better.","Beauty Q&A: Are shampoos for colored hair different than regular shampoos?","883b2751d63550d3b8385c702cdbdfc17c3d83e8","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2010/01/beauty-qa-are-shampoos-for-colored-hair-different-than-regular-shampoos/"

As a follow up, here’s a story about new way to treat gray hair that may cure it forever. Hair color breakthrough According to this reference , shampoo researchers say that you’ll be able to wash the gray out of your hair within the next few years. Dr. Bruno Bernard, head of L’Oreal’s hair biology research team explains that hair turns gray when melanocytes, pigment-producing cells, stop working properly. Bernard and his fellow researchers have found that these non-functioning cells lack a certain enzyme known as TRP-2 and they’re planning further studies to determine how to reactivate this enzyme’s action on hair follicles. If successful, this treatement could allow us to keep our hair color for longer, or maybe even restore color back to gray hair. If you want to read more, here’s a more detailed discussion of Bruno’s theories on hair biology . The Beauty Brains bottom line This is cosmetic science at its finest – solving hair care problems with innovative technology. But unfortunately this technology certainly won’t be cheap! And because you have to wait for your hair to grow out to see a difference it’ll take a while to see a change. We wonder would it take to convince a person to use a product like this that is very expensive and that could take weeks or even months before it really shows results.

"The Beauty Brains","","Is mineral makeup okay for oily skin? by The Beauty Brains Sophia’s mineral malady: I am still trying to find a Mineral Makeup shade match. I have ordered many many sample kits from Everyday Minerals. Several shades, or mixes rather, work fine for a couple hours, but they all deepen in color,and by the end of the day I am either green or orange, and I just look dirty. I have found that blotting seems to help decrease the darkening– it does seem to be a function of excess oil production, and I am working on my skin health and maintenance, but I am wondering is Mineral Makeup just not suitable for those with oily skin? The Right Brain’s enlightening reply: Thanks for your question Sophia, it gives me a chance to remind Mid Brain that we’re STILL WAITING FOR OUR MINERAL MAKEUP REPORT ! Remember, the one you promised us back in March? Come on, it’s been MONTHS! MONTHS already!! Ok, now that I’ve got that out of my system, here’s a theory on why Mineral Makeup doesn’t look good on your oily skin. True mineral makeup consists of ingredients like titanium dioxide, kaolin, talc, and mica. It doesn’t contain any kind of oil or binders. So, when you put this powder on your face it will absorb more oil from your skin than other types of makeup that already contain oil. Oil wets the pigments and makes them appear darker. Traditional liquid foundations and blushes the pigments are already “pre-wetted” so they don’t get any darker from your skin oil. The Beauty Brains bottom line Compared to makeup that contains oil, Mineral Makeup is more likely to look darker when it comes in contact with your skin oils. If you have oily skin and you don’t like the way pure mineral products look on you, maybe you should consider a conventional liquid or cream makeup base. Has anyone else in the Beauty Brains community had this problem with Mineral Makeup? Want to know more about Mineral Makeup? SO DO I! And if we don’t see a report SOON we’re going to have an opening for a new intern here at the Beauty Brains.

"The Beauty Brains","","France’s Secret Cellulite Solution by The Beauty Brains In case you haven’t heard, Garnier (a division of L’Oreal ) is launching a number of new skin care products here in the United States. But interesting, there’s one new product they market in their home country of France that’s not available here in the U.S. The product, which is sold under Garnier’s Skin Naturals BodyTonic line, is called “ Anti-Cellulite Flat Stomach Roll-On .” It’s designed to “smooth excess stomach fat folds and cellulite with its roll-on applicator. Its formula is enriched with lipo-caffeine to burn fat, and botanical elasto-fibres to firm the skin.” I’m not really sure what botanical elasto-fibers are, but that lipo-caffeine fat burner sure sounds good!

Windex is a mixture of water, rubbing alcohol and some industrial solvents. Yes, it might help degrease your oily skin and it might even kill off a few acne causing bacteria, but it won’t work as well as pimple medications that you buy in the store.

"The Beauty Brains","","What’s the Best Way to Apply Sunscreen? by The Beauty Brains Kelly’s question… I wanted to see if you might have an answer for me about sunscreen and how to apply it. Forever, I have been told that you apply your products first – eye cream, serums, moisturizer and then your sunscreen is the last step before your makeup. Yesterday, on another well respected blog , Dr. Schultz from Derm TV, suggested that your sunscreen should go on first so it is closest to the skin and can be effective. He suggests that you skip serums in the morning, as they aren’t likely to work as intended. He also suggested that you apply products from the thinnest to the heaviest. Protecting my skin from the sun is my primary concern and if I am not using the products correctly or making them ineffective, I want to know the right way! The Left Brain’s response: You raise some interesting questions and the truth is this question is one for which science hasn’t determined an answer. Good arguments could be made for both methods of application. Until there is a definitive study, there is no known “right” answer. But take heart, there is not really a “wrong” answer either. Here is what the Brains conclude (with all due respect to the doctor) about these issues. Sunscreen savvy For physical blocking sunscreens (minerals) like Titanium Dioxide or Zinc Oxide, it doesn’t matter. They’ll work just the same whether it’s put on first or last. In this case, we recommend putting it on after your moisturizer just so the sunscreen doesn’t inhibit the penetrating ability of the moisturizer (or other treatment). Chemical sunscreens (e.g. Oxycinnamate) are a bit different because the raw materials in the formulas can have an impact on the final SPF rating. That means if you use apply it after your moisturizer, you may reduce the SPF efficacy. So, Zinc & Titanium on last, all other sunscreens on first. Of course, you could actually solve the entire problem by using a moisturizer that contains sunscreen. Serum uncertainty As for the question about the serums… again, the science hasn’t been done but there is a good rationale for using them at night rather than in the morning. Many of the active ingredients are UV sensitive so they will most likely be less effective if exposed to the sun. Wearing eye products at night prevents this problem. What’s your face cream routine?

"The Beauty Brains","","Does Huge Lips Skinny Hips lip gloss really work? by The Beauty Brains Skylighthope asks… I recently came upon this product and was very curious about whether or not it works. The product is called Huge Lips Skinny Hips Lip Gloss and serves two purposes…a lip plumper, and also as an appetite suppressant through the ingredient hoodia. Does this product actually work, and is it safe? =) Left Brain gets lippy… Some people think I’m a little too cynical, but that is just wrong. I love the idea of products like this! It’s a novel and creative idea that could really change the face of cosmetics if it actually worked. Imagine a lipstick that looked good and helped you lose weight. But sigh, it looks like they’ve put out the marketing hype before all the science was worked out. Will “Huge Lips Skinny Hips” plump lips? As we saw in this previous Beauty Brains about lip plumpers , there are only two kinds that actually work. Type A: A moisturizing lipstick that smoothes out wrinkles and makes lips look moist (pretty much any lipstick). Type B: A product containing an irritant like menthoxypropanediol that actually irritates lips and causes a inflammation response. Neither will be permanent but your lips will look more plump. The Huge Lips Skinny Hips product is more like a Type A product relying on a moisturizing ingredient like Meadowfoam emollient. But it also contains Lemonpeel oil that can be irritating like menthoxypropanediol products. Will Hoodia suppress your appetite? The makers of Huge Lips Skinny Hips have included some Hoodia extract in the formula implying that it will have an appetite suppressing effect. While there have been some preliminary studies that showed Hoodia has this effect, the conclusion is tenuous at best. Hoodia has never been proven to help people lose weight. Plus, the amount of hoodia you’ll get from this product is so minimal, it’s negligible. A better idea would’ve been to consult the folks over at the Smell and Taste Institute and incorporate some of their tastant crystals . That’s not to say it would work either but at least there would be some science to back up the claims. To Purplelab’s credit they admit that the Hoodia probably isn’t going to get you to stop eating. They just figure it can’t hurt. And the truth is, they are probably right. The small amount you might ingest will not have an effect one way or another. How much lipstick do you eat? There was one interesting claim at their website that said “women ingest up to 9 lbs of lipstick in their lifetime.” I tried to track down the source of this number, but couldn’t find anything definitive. This seems rather high to me. If that were true, that means you would use about 288 tubes of lipstick. Another common claim is 4 to 6 lbs which still means you would eat at least 128 tubes in your lifetime. I looked up some ingestion data on Pubmed and found that on average women use 10 mg of lipstick per application. So… Assuming 4 applications per day Every day of her life For 70 years That means she will ingest 2.2 lbs of lipstick in a lifetime. (This also assumes that everything applied gets ingested which we know is not true based on the amount of lipstick left on wine glasses). 2.2 lbs of lipstick in a lifetime Beauty Brains bottom line Since Huge Lips Skinny Hips uses ingredients that are listed in the INCI dictionary (the cosmetic industry standard book) it’s safe to say that this product is safe. It is also probably effective for producing plump lips for a short time anyway. But don’t expect you hips to get any skinnier. The weight loss claims are dubious at best. How many tubes of lipstick or lip gloss do you use in a year?

Dr. Brandt Poreless Toner for Normal to Oily skin Ingredients: Aqua (Water), Alcohol, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Extract, Glycerin, Camellia Sinensis Leaf (Green Tea) Extract, Polysorbate 20, Propylene Glycol, Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Oil, Citric Acid, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Oil, Salicylic Acid, Sodium PCA, Panthenol, Sodium Hydroxide, Sodium Hyaluronate, Diazolidinyl Urea, Tetra Sodium EDTA, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Propylene Glycol. A pore choice? Probably the most impactful difference is that Dr. Brandt Poreless Toner is based on alcohol which is drying to skin. (That’s because it rearranges the skin’s surface lipids.) Paula’s toner is based on water and glycol which are much less stripping. In addition, the Dr. Brandt product extracts like rosemary, lavender, and tea tree oil which are potentially irritating for certain people. Paula’s products deliberately stay away from ingredients like this. Finally, Dr. Brandt uses a pair of parabens to preserve his product. And while there’s nothing proven wrong with these preservatives some companies have decided to remove them from their formulas to appease consumers. So, Paula uses phenoxyethanol instead. While it’s not as effective at preservation, it does impart a nice rose scent to the product. (For more info see our post on the Perils of Parabens .) The Beauty brains Bottom line This was just a quick example of how Paula’s Choice product compare; of course to be a full scientific comparison we’d need to evaluate many more products. But we’re just trying to give you a sense of what to look for. And remember, less irritating doesn’t necessarily mean her products work any better than other brands. But if you’re looking for a brand products that’s designed to limit irritation we would recommend taking a look at Paula’s Choice. What do YOU think? Have you tried any of Paula’s Choice products?

"The Beauty Brains","","The right way to apply AHA products by The Beauty Brains Kim and Kate both want to know the right way to apply alpha-hydroxy and beta-hydroxy lotions. Kim uses acne products that contain salicylic acid (a beta-hydroxy acid) and she`s worried that applying moisturizer on top of the sal acid may be making it less effective. Kate’s been told that she should wait 15 minutes after showering before applying an AHA because the water in skin will dilute the acids. So, she’s concerned that she’s not waiting long enough after she showers before applying her AmLacTin AHA lotion. The Right Brain attempts an answer: The answers to these questions were surprisingly tricky to track down. Concentration is a crucial factor for AHA efficacy in products like Alpha Hydrox . According to the FDA , the Cosmetic Ingredient Review board has determined that AHA`s are safe at concentrations up to 10% for over the counter consumer products. For products used by trained cosmetologists, the concentration can be as high as 20 to 30%, and for doctors it`s an astonishing 50 to 70%. These higher concentrations are safe only if followed by thorough rinsing and application of a sun protection product. (That`s because AHAs can increase your sensitivity to UV radiation. But that`s a topic for another post.) But while everyone agrees that AHA and BHA functionality is affected by concentration (and pH) we couldn`t find any direct evidence that to show that either skin moisture or moisturizing lotions can reduce the effective concentration of these active ingredients. The Brains Bottom Line: We did find out that BHAs penetrate skin quickly, so it`s unlikely that use of a moisturizer on top of sal acid would cause significant problem. But if your just-showered skin is really wet when you apply an AHA, it is at least theatrically possible that you`re reducing its efficacy. Better safe than sorry, we say. So until we can find some data to the contrary, we`d recommend making sure your skin is dry before using AmLacTin . If you`re still worried about sealing in moisture in towel dried skin, you may want to use a conventional moisturizer.","The right way to apply AHA products","8f2d5e9bde1569c1c5fb6c0a1c603a057028957a","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2007/03/the-right-way-to-apply-aha-products/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Expire or Perspire: When antiperspirants go bad by The Beauty Brains Jenna’s question: Do you really have to heed the expiration date on antiperspirants and deodorants? Is it dangerous to use any that have expired? The Right Brain’s reply: If you read 5 Ways That Beauty Products Go Bad , you know that regular cosmetic products (like deodorants) are NOT required to have an expiration date in the US. But products like antiperspirants that are over the counter drugs, do have to provide a date. Is it dangerous to use an antiperspirant that’s past it’s expiration date? Well, it’s not as dangerous as being in jail with flesh eating bacteria , but there are a fews things you should know: Top 3 Ways Antiperspirants Can Expire 1. Active ingredient absentia The worst that can happen is that the active ingredient loses efficacy and it doesn’t stop you from sweating. This can happen if the ingredient settles out or crystallizes over time. That’s why companies are required to test their product to determine how long they expect the active ingredient to last. 2. Drying Danger Antiperspirant sticks are made with volatile silicones that can evaporate as the stick ages (especially if you ever leave the cap off!) This can cause the stick to dry out which will make it crumble when you use it. It can also form tiny crystals that can scratch your armpits. 3. Fragrance Freakout Besides keeping you dry, most antiperspirants are fragranced to make you smell good. Fragrances are complex mixtures of chemicals that can react and change over time. It’s not uncommon for a fragrance to start to smell bad when the product gets old. So you may not sweat, but your Secret stick could still be stinky.","Expire or Perspire: When antiperspirants go bad","5b427c371b12bc853896c0f800f0e54f3e775d34","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2007/08/expire-or-perspire-when-antiperspirants-go-bad/"

"The Beauty Brains","","What causes white marks from deodorants? by The Beauty Brains Kitten divine from the forums says… I’m having a little trouble finding a deodorant that I like. The problem is that they all leave white marks in my t-shirts. I’ve tried different brands and I always pick the one that claims to leave no white marks, so I really don’t get it. So what I wanted to ask is what causes the white marks? Does it make a difference whether you use a spray, a roll-on or a stick formula? Are they’re certain ingredients you have to avoid to prevent them? And is they’re a difference between regular deodorants and antiperspirants when it comes to white marks? Left Brain’s residual retort The solution to this problem is simple…wear white t-shirts. Of course, this will severely restrict your fashion options and totally ruin any Goth look you might be going for so let’s see what else you might try. First, see this link for a quick primer on the differences between antiperspirants and deodorants . Essentially, AP stops you from sweating, Deodorants stop you from smelling. What causes the white marks? There is a variety of things that can be causing the white marks. Let’s start with antiperspirants. The primary ingredients that make antiperspirants work are aluminum salts including aluminum chlorohydrates, aluminum zirconium chlorohydrates, and aluminum chloride. In the United States, these have been deemed by the FDA as “generally recognized as safe and effective” and are the only ones allowed for use in stopping perspiration. The exact mechanism by how they work has not been definitively determined, but the leading theory is that the aluminum salts form a layer that blocks and closes the sweat gland. Unfortunately, these aluminum salts can also form the white, chalky marks when they dry out. To reduce these white marks, AP/DO makers use hydrating solvents in their formulas. However, they can’t completely eliminate the residue because the more solvent they use the less effective and aesthetically appealing the products become. No one wants to put a product under their arms that feels “wet”. While deodorants don’t have aluminum salts, they do have other ingredients that can cause residues. These are the white, waxy materials used to deliver the active ingredients such as sodium stearate, stearyl alcohol or glyceryl stearate. Does the type of product matter? All AP/DO have the potential to produce a residue, but some are more likely than others. In general, dry sticks and powders will be the most likely to exhibit the problem. (They’re also the most effective at stopping wetness). Creams can also be problematic but less so than sticks. After that, roll-ons, aerosols and lotions all have about the same whitening potential. What ingredients should you avoid? It’s not a simple matter to just avoid specific ingredients. Whether a product causes whiteness or not depends also on the way it is manufactured and the way your body is designed. However, the following guidelines can help. Use a deodorant If wetness is not your problem, avoiding antiperspirants and using a deodorant is a good option. Look for a stick like Adidas Absorbent Deo Deodorant Look for clear formulas But if you can’t get away without using an antiperspirant, then try a clear formula like Mitchum Anti-Perspirant & Deodorant . This should work for most people. Ultimately, you’ll have to experiment with different brands to find what works best. Keep your shirts clean And if you feel like your typical washing habits aren’t removing the underarm build-up, you can try a product like Clarsskin which is supposed to do a better job of removing residue. Beauty Brains bottom line White residue is a natural property of antiperspirants and deodorants. It is something that cosmetic chemists continue to try and improve and things have gotten much better.

"The Beauty Brains","2016-05-25 17:37:00","Is there a better way to get my gray hair dyed? by The Beauty Brains Gauhar goes gray… I am 34. My hair is about 80% gray. I am in a very conservative profession. I know that going all gray will negatively affect my career. I am having troubles with hair dye sticking to my hair. Is there any affordable, easy, simple do-it-yourself hair color, which is much better for gray hair coverage? The Right Brain replies: Hair color technology has been around a long time and there have been very few earth-shaking breakthroughs in the category. But now Clairol says they have a new Advanced Gray Solution technology that is gentler and provides better gray coverage. They claim that it covers gray by combining the best of demi and semi permanent hair coloring technology. While this technology is being marketed primarily to African Americans, you might find that it applies to your hair type as well. Does Clairol Advanced Gray Solution really work? The information on Clairol’s website was intriguing but it didn’t provide enough information for us to make a balanced assessment. So we asked for Clairol for more information. We submitted the following five key questions which they were nice enough to answer. Here are our questions along with their answers. Q1. How does it combine the benefits from both semi and demi-permanent color? A1. Beautiful Collection Advanced Gray Solution combines the gentleness of a semi-permanent color with the coverage capabilities of a near demi-permanent color. Typical semi-permanent colors often wash out quickly and provide only limited gray coverage. This is because semi-permanent color is a one-step process that delivers dye molecules that sit just under the hair cuticle, causing the color to wash out quickly. Alternatively, demi-permanent hair colors are used with a developer that contains peroxide. The developer, in conjunction with an oxidative dye, forms a molecule that is able to penetrate the hair shaft to provide longer-lasting results. Unfortunately, peroxide is not beneficial to African-American hair because it weakens it, making it even more susceptible to chemical damage. Advanced Gray Solution’s SynAIRgy technology creates a whole new kind of dye system – one with direct acting dyes that wrap the outside of the hair, and oxidative dyes that react with oxygen in the AIR (instead of a developer) to form a larger molecule able to penetrate more deeply into the hair shaft. With no ammonia and no peroxide, it’s gentle enough to use immediately after a relaxer service. Q2. What are the ingredients in the product? A2. Advanced Gray Solution’s enriched formula contains oleic acid and fatty alcohols to leave hair feeling moisturized and full of shine. The entire ingredient list includes: * Water * Oleic Acid * Toluene-2 * Ascorbic Acid * Undeceth-3 * Cetearyl Alcohol * 5-Diamine Sulfate * 2-Methylresorcinol * Alcohol Denat. * Glycol Distearate * Fragrance * 2-Amino-6-Chloro-4-Nitrophenol * Ethanolamine * Cocamidopropyl Betaine * Resorcinol * Disodium Edta * Hydroxyethyl-2-Nitro-P-Touidine * Basic Blue 99 * HC Red No. 3 * M-Aminophenol Q3. How does Advanced Gray Solutions react with oxygen in the air instead of a developer? A3. Advanced Gray Solution’s breakthrough SynAIRgy technology contains an oxidative dye that uses oxygen in the air as a color developer to form a large dye molecule, eliminating the need to use a product with hydrogen peroxide for longer-lasting coverage. Q4. How does it form a “larger molecule able to penetrate more deeply into the hair shaft” when generally speaking, smaller molecules penetrate better? A4. The word ‘larger’ is a relative term. A molecule that is larger than the direct dye molecules will stay under the hair cuticle and begin to wedge itself into the cortex. Smaller dye molecules like the ones in direct dyes will simply sit under cuticle and rinse out within 4-6 weeks. Q5. Are there any details on the testing that was done to establish that Advanced Gray Solution provides up to 50% gray coverage vs. up to 25% for most other semi-permanent colors? A5. The secret to Advanced Gray Solution’s greater gray coverage is the formula’s new-to-the-world SynAIRgy technology. With this breakthrough technology we are able to have two dye systems: direct acting dyes that sit just under the hair cuticle, and oxidative dyes that penetrate more deeply into the hair shaft. Since gray hair lacks melanin, we found that this two dye systems works significantly better than other semi-permanent colors to provide longer-lasting gray coverage. The Beauty Brains bottom line Without first hand information of their formulations or access to their test results, it’s difficult for us to determine if this technology provide differentiated benefits that are consumer perceptible or not. But Clairol was kind enough to provide relatively specific answers to our questions, even if they may be lacking in some detail. Nonetheless, we thank them for that information. In our experience, very few brands are willing to submit their products to this kind of scrutiny; so we give them high marks for their openness. Having said that, its up to you to decide if you think the information they provided was helpful in making your decision to try their product. I’m sure they’d appreciate hearing your feedback. What do YOU think? Did Clairol’s answers to our questions convince you that their product lives up to their claims?

"The Beauty Brains","","First cosmetic animal testing alternatives approved by The Beauty Brains If you believed everything you heard from animal rights activist groups, you might think that the cosmetic industry could easily stop testing on animals. They have suggested that there are dozens of alternatives to animal testing . Well, the scientists in the cosmetic industry and readers of the Beauty Brains know that this hasn’t been true. The issue of animal testing of cosmetics is not so simple. In fact, until just recently there were no approved alternatives to animal testing. Instead, companies that wanted to claim “cruelty free” have relied on using formulas that are composed of compounds that had previously been tested on animals or farming the dirty work out to their raw material suppliers. Animal Testing Alternative? But there’s some good news on this front. The FDA, EPA, and CPSC have all given approval to two animal alternative testing methods for detecting eye damage. The two new methods include the bovine corneal opacity and permeability assay and the isolated chicken eye assay. These are the first approved animal alternatives that the cosmetic industry can use as proof that their products are safe. This seems like great news because there is now a real alternative to sacrificing lab animals (like bunny rabbits) for testing whether cosmetics will cause irritation. On the other hand, the tests still involve using animal tissue. The difference is that the tissues are from animals that were previously slaughtered for things like steaks and chicken nuggets. Beauty Brains bottom line The incidence of animal testing in the cosmetic industry has been dramatically reduced in the last few decades and it looks to continue to get more rare. Thankfully, scientists are working on alternatives to make this a non-issue. Hopefully, that time comes soon.","First cosmetic animal testing alternatives approved","e97c3b01558bbf65c1a5461685c78dd5cb0f3baf","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2008/06/first-cosmetic-animal-testing-alternatives-approved/"
"The Beauty Brains","2017-07-30 00:41:00","Skin tightening lotions: Science or scam? by The Beauty Brains Rachel says she found us thru Beauty Addict and she wants to know if skin tightening lotions really work. Specifically, she wants to know if the super-expensive products from Dr. Brandt and Dr. Perricone are just a huge waste of money again. The Left Brain speaks: Skin tightening lotions are a scam. The best performance you can expect from this kind of product is a temporary tightening feel if the product contains film forming agents. And even this marginal effect is not very long lasting. You specifically asked about Dr. Brandt`s products. Our favorite quote about this product comes from the Cosmetic Cop who says… Dr. Brandt`s Crease Release ($150 for 1 ounce) contains gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), an amino acid that acts as a neurotransmitter inhibitor to relax facial muscles. However, there is absolutely no research showing this to be the case. In fact, if this product did work as it states, the face and neck muscles would become relaxed, causing increased sagging. The only skin tightening techniques that REALLY work are done by dermatologists. The latest methods for improving firmness and texture use lasers, radio waves, and injectable fillers. They’re expensive but they really do work. You can read about them at The Academy Of American Dermatologists . The Brains Bottom Line : Don’t waste your money on expensive tightening lotions. Splurge on a good facial sunscreen instead! Now the vitamins, herbal tonics and nutritional supplements can be taken from the vitamin shop .

"The Beauty Brains","","Mascara Masquerade: Great Lash & Revlon 3D by The Beauty Brains Angel Asks: I’m using Maybelline Great Lash right now but it’s not really doing anything for me because I want longer and thicker lashes. I saw a commercial for this new Revlon 3D Extreme mascara, that gives 17X fuller, 70% curvier, and 50% visibly longer lashes. Please tell me if it’s any good before I waste my money. The Right Brain responds: Is Maybelline better than Revlon? As you know from our previous posts , mascara works by coating your tiny eyelash hairs with ingredients like waxes and polymers. The thickening effect varies greatly from product to product depending on which ingredients they use and how much they put in. So, we did a quick side by side comparison with the two products you asked about to see if we could see any major difference. Here’s what we found: Seeing is believing Photo one shows lashes treated with Great Lash. You’ll notice that on these lashes it looks like most of the coating is concentrated on the upper 1/3 or so of the lash. Not much is on the tips of the lashes. Photo 2 shows Revlon 3D lashes. These lashes look like they’ve got more coating on the tips. It also appears like the natural curl of the lash is accentuated. What do all the numbers mean? We have no way of telling if 3D mascara really thickens and curls as much as Revlon claims. Companies are required to have support for their advertising and since Revlon is a reputable company, let’s assume they have SOME kind of data that shows such large percentage increases. The exact size of the number doesn’t really matter. It’s kind of a advertising game that is used by many companies in many different industries: create a test that gives you the type of claim you want to market. There’s nothing wrong with that as long as the advertising isn’t misleading. And in this case, at least from our quick side-by-side test, 3D looks like it does a pretty decent job. Interested?

The Left Brain responds: Silicone is a much maligned ingredient; I’m really not sure what it’s done to deserve this reputation. Wear off or wash off? Whether or not a silicone will “wear off” depends on what type of silicone you’re talking about. Dimethicone needs to be washed off. Cyclomethicone will evaporate off your hair just like water evaporates. Generally, any shampoo will wash away the silicone left on your hair from styling treatments and conditioners.

In a nutshell, they claim that if you cut hair with heated scissors (or a razor), the ends are essentially cauterized so they are left with a glass like smoothness. Split ends heat sealer? I have to admit that the Jaguar Theracut website looks very convincing. It explains how the process works works, how it’s different than conventional hair cutting, and what the overall benefits are. You can see what I mean from these pictures that I borrowed from their website. (If Jaguar complains I’ll gladly take them down.) Here are the “with” and “without” pictures: These images are amazing. So amazing, in fact, that they trigger my Skeptic-Sense. One of the credos of the skeptic is “extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof.” And these photos are extraordinary because they contradict our understanding of basic hair biology. Extraordinary claims Why? Because they show that hair fibers can be “melted” to form a smooth surface when cut. This is very unlikely given that hair is not a polymer that can be “melted” like plastic. The claim is so extraordinary that a single data point (this website) is not sufficient to convince me that it’s real. If all they claimed was that their treatment made the cuticle smoother, a simple electron micrograph would be enough to be convincing. But when they’re claiming to do something to hair that seems contrary to our general body of knowledge, my BS alarm goes off. After all, anything can be Photoshopped these days. As a good skeptic, I can’t totally dismiss this data I’d expect to find some kind of corroborative data from other legitimate sources like the Journal of the Society of Cosmetic Chemists or the Textile Research Institute. To date, I have been unable to find any other studies that confirm this “melting” phenomena. The Beauty Brains bottom line If this product really does cut hair as it claims, it should provide a significant reduction in split ends. But I’m still skeptical on Jaguar’s claims until I see more data from the scientific literature that backs up these claims. If anyone know of any, please let me know and I’ll be glad to reconsider my position. In the meantime, I’m calling BS on this one. Have YOU ever had your hair cut with hot scissors? Did you notice a difference?

"The Beauty Brains","2013-12-26 11:11:00","Does baby oil contain ingredients that really work? by The Beauty Brains Livelovelaugh longs to learn… I’ve noticed that Johnsons have variations of their regular baby oil – Johnsons baby oil lavender, and Johnsons baby oil with aloe vera and vitamin e. Do these extra ingredients actually have any benefit, or are they just a gimmick to jack up the price of what would otherwise be cheap mineral oil? The Right Brain replies Johnsons Baby Oil With Aloe Vera & Vitamin E sells for 20 ounces for $4.50. Likewise, the same amount of regular plain old Johnson’s Baby Oil also costs $4.50 (at least on Amazon.com). So while these ingredients may be a gimmick it’s not a gimmick that jacks up the price very much. (BTW, Sarah Bellum says it’s much cheaper when you buy it in 55 gallon drums which makes me wonder exactly what she does in her spare time. But that’s another story…) Mad about mineral oil Mineral oil is the main ingredient in baby oil. And based on comments we’ve gotten on our previous posts on mineral oil , many people consider it to be the cosmetic equivalent of the Anti-Christ. We won’t open that can of worms here today but we will restate our belief that, based on available data, mineral oil is a safe and effective moisturizer. The other ingredients you asked about are more in question. Baby oil bamboozle? Here’s our take on the “featured” ingredients used in Johnsons Baby Oil: Lavender oil can make baby oil smell better but it can also be irritating (and some people say it causes young boys to grow boobies.) Aloe Vera does have some beneficial properties but it’s not oil soluble so it’s highly unlikely that there’s enough in the mineral oil to make a difference on your skin. Vitamin E also provides some skin benefits and it is oil soluble. But the question is, how much is in the formula and how well is it stabilized. If the cost of the formula is the same with and without the vitamin, that’s a pretty good indication that it’s present at too low of a concentration to provide a measurable effect. Beauty Brains bottom line Extra ingredients like lavender oil and aloe vera provide little, if any, additional benefit in baby oil. But as long as it doesn’t raise the price, why not indulge yourself with the “special” version? (Unless you’re one of these people whose skin reacts to lavender oil, of course!) What do YOU think?

"The Beauty Brains","","How to make your brown eyes blue by The Beauty Brains Mid Brain muses: The folks over at C&E News are reporting on a new technology for changing your eye color. Researchers at Ciba Vision and Bausch & Lomb have come up with a new way to change eye color that works much better than the current technology. While colored lenses have been around since the 1970′s, they haven’t worked well for making brown eyes look naturally blue. But now by using nanotechnology (really really tiny particles) and inspiration from the wings of butterflies, even the darkest brown eyes can be made blue. And it won’t even require a breakup with your boyfriend. I’ve gotta tell you, it’s stories like these that makes this Beauty Brain proud to be a scientist. What do YOU think?

"The Beauty Brains","None","The big lie about tanning lotions by The Beauty Brains Jessica admits to committing a beauty sin: she tans indoors. She’s been told that in order to maximize your skin’s ability to tan, you should use an indoor tanning lotion. They have ingredients such as Tyrosine that are supposed to make you tan faster/better, as opposed to regular body lotion. She wants to know if the ingredients in indoor tanning lotions make a difference in how you tan. The Right Brain responds: Jessica, Jessica, Jessica. We’ll skip the lecture about how bad tanning is for your skin and instead we’ll just jump right in and start bashing tanning accelerators. To put it scientifically, these tyrosine tanners are bulls**t. The companies that sell pills and lotions with tryosine claim that they stimulate the production of melanin, the natural pigment that makes you look tan. Unfortunately, that’s just not true. How Tyrosine In Your Body Is Good For Your Tan It is true that tyrosine plays a role in the tanning process. It’s an amino acid that your body forms by breaking down the protein you eat. This amino acid is then broken down by an enyzme called tryosinase that is formed by melanin-producing cells in your skin known as melanocytes. This reaction converts tyrosine into a chemical called DOPA. DOPA reacts further to form Dopaquinone which in turn forms the different types of melanin. (Eumelanin is black-brown and pheomelanin is yellow-red.) This chain reaction is triggered when your skin is exposed to UV light. How Tyrosine in Tanning Pills and Lotions Is Bad But taking pills with tyrosine or rubbing a tyrosine lotion on your skin doesn’t really help the process. In fact, according to the American Cancer Society , Tanning accelerators, such as those formulated with the amino acid tyrosine or tyrosine derivatives, are ineffective … evidence suggests they don’t work. FDA considers them unapproved new drugs that have not been proven safe and effective. It makes sense if you think about it – swallowing a chemical like tyrosine or rubbing it on your skin doesn’t necessarily make it available to the right metabolic pathways. So shame on all the companies out there marketing tyrosine-based products! Shame on you Hawaiin Tropic Tan 2 Max . Shame on you Reviva Sun Tan Protection Lotion. And shame on YOU, Bio-tan Sunless Tanner . The Brains Bottom Line : Don’t waste your money on tyrosine tanning accelerators, they don’t do anything special for your tan.","The big lie about tanning lotions","91cb8ffeefd72b843999e9e978fb788b20467543","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2007/03/the-big-lie-about-tanning-lotions/"

This one comes from Fauxmccoy in the Beauty Brains Forum. You should j oin the forum if you want to get all the behind the scenes scoops and sexy chit-chat that’s too provocative for the blog. Case in point: Faux tipped us off to a new fragrance product that I guarantee is unlike anything you’ve ever seen. (This one’s not for the kiddies, so if you’re under 18 stop reading this now.

"Perry Romanowski","","Can you train your hair to be less oily? by Perry Romanowski Mandy’s Musing… Hey Brains!! Great website!! I’m a sucker for healthy hair and methods on keeping it healthy, and I was surfing through the net and found this article: http://www.tlhs.org/vid06.jpg . What do you think? Is it possible for hair to get used to not being washed and therefore not producing so much oil so that it won’t look greasy over time? Could this method keep hair at it’s healthiest? Wouldn’t this cause dandruff? The Left Brain’s Learned Reply: Interesting question, Mandy. Let’s start with the last part of your question first: Does not washing your hair cause dandruff? No, it doesn’t. Dandruff is caused by a combination of over active sebaceous glands and bacteria. If you don’t have dandruff, skipping your shampoo won’t “give” it to you. Oil control Now, let’s talk about how oil (also known as sebum) gets on your scalp in the first place. Sebum is generated in tiny sebaceous glands beneath the surface of the skin. These glands produce an oily substance that reaches the skin’s surface through hair follicles. Some sebum is a good thing – it’s a natural moisturizer and it keeps your skin and hair soft and supple. But, some people are prone to excess sebum production and that can be too much of a good thing. (If you’re interested, you can find some excellent background information on sebum at dermnet.) When you ask if your hair can get used to not being washed you’re implying that leaving oil on your hair will somehow stop the production of more oil. The flip side of that implication is that stripping away the oil with a shampoo will make your glands produce more oil. Well guess what. That’s exactly what DOES happen. Sort of. Gland-tastic To understand how this works, you have understand how sebum production is regulated – in other words what turns the sebum glands on and off. It turns out that it’s the presence of sebum on the surface of skin that controls sebum production. How is that possible? Well, if you REALLY want to know, go read this study in which scientists stripped oil off skin and then measured how long it took the skin to re-oil itself. Their data indicates that the presence of oil on the skin’s surface sends a signal to the sebaceous glands to turn off. This signal is caused by either the pressure of the oil in the follicle or by the creation of a chemical signal that travels back down through the skin. So it turns out that, in theory, you can “train” your hair to be less oily. Shampoo and sebum But then why doesn’t shampooing make your scalp oilier and oilier? That’s because the oil production levels off very quickly. Here’s how that works: If you wash your hair you remove all the sebum on your scalp and that triggers your sebaceous glands to produce more oil. But once they’ve produced enough sebum to cover the your scalp, all that oil sends a signal to shut off production. So, you only end up with a certain amount of oil on your scalp – let’s call that amount “x.” Now lets say that you don’t wash your hair – the sebum will still build up until it reaches “x ” amount. But then, the glands get the message to stop producing more oil. So, unless you take some of the sebum away, you still end up with “x” amount on your scalp. See how that works? Even though washing away sebum does trigger more sebum to be produced the sebum production levels off once the oils hits the scalp. The notion that washing your hair triggers more oil, which then makes you wash your hair again, which in turn gives you MORE oil so you end up with 2x or 3x oil on your hair or skin is just not true. Of course, this is the case for healthy skin. If you have over-active sebaceous glands you can end up with oil skin or hair. But it’s not the shampooing that’s causing the excessive oiliness. The Beauty Brains bottom line Depending on your hair type and how oily your skin is naturally, you might benefit by not washing your hair as much. That would be an interesting experiment to conduct. But don’t skip shampooing just because someone told you that it makes your hair oilier. That’s just not true.","Can you train your hair to be less oily?","61430bed62510a7dda58d599a79a7628c57bf627","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2010/01/can-you-train-your-hair-to-be-less-oily/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Are salon products in regular stores the same as those in salons? by The Beauty Brains I stumbled upon this question over at the excellent beauty blog Doryn’s Dish . Essentially, the reader wanted to know if the salon products that you buy at the local Kroger (general store) are the same as the ones you can buy at a salon. The answer referenced this story by a news team out of Fort Meyers, Florida. The story was so biased and misinformed I thought a balanced, insider response was needed. We’ll reproduce it here for our readers. Interesting story. We are cosmetic chemists that work in the industry and know that this story is a bit skewed. If the news reporters wanted to get the “real” story, they shouldn’t be asking the head of Paul Mitchell because he is completely biased. The truth is these salon brands depend on ‘diverted’ product to boost their sales. They want to have it both ways. They want to tell you that Paul Mitchell is a salon-only brand which makes it seem more exclusive, but they also want the high volume sales that they can only get through mass market outlets like your local Kroger . Additionally, they don’t want to anger their salon distributors because people are able to get the same stuff but for cheaper. They make up this story of products being inferior. In nearly all cases, they are not. The way diversion works is this. Paul Mitchell hires a company to manufacture their products. Then Paul Mitchell sales people get and fill orders from distributors. Distributors are legitimate businesses that sell directly to independent salons. The distributors can order as much as they want, then sell it to the salons who can then sell it to you. Some of these distributors work directly with stores like Kroger, Albertsons, etc. So when these stores put in an order (a really big order compared to a salon) the distributors just order more product from Paul Mitchell to fill the Kroger order. Paul Mitchell doesn’t even question the big orders because they like the extra sales. They turn a blind eye to what`s going on just so they can express public “outrage” that their product is being sold at the local drugstore. This is bunch of bunk. The stuff you get at the local Kroger is every bit as good as the stuff you get at the salon. Don’t be fooled. If the folks at Paul Mitchell really wanted to stop these sales, they would simply question their distributors and find out who is selling to Kroger, or Target or Albertson. The problem of counterfeiting is a real one, but it’s not something that you’ll find at large stores like Kroger. That company is not going to sell something contaminated because they would be sued in a heartbeat. The places that are a little more sketchy are the small shops (some salons) with the dust on top of the bottles. Those are the places you have to worry about. Check out I Want That Hair.com for hair beauty products . The Beauty Brains Bottom line… You can trust that if you’re buying a salon brand from a regular store, there is no difference between it and the stuff you can get at a salon. And if anyone from one of those salon brands sees it differently, they are welcome to respond to the Beauty Brains.","Are salon products in regular stores the same as those in salons?","a745c3f1ec6475522d5fc8172b488a418807a42b","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2009/06/are-salon-products-in-regular-stores-the-same-as-those-in-salons/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Does cocoa butter in lush jungle hair really work? by The Beauty Brains Cianyde says… I have started wondering if my current fav conditioner (‘Jungle’ hair conditioner from Lush ) is as good as I thought it was… The main ingredient is ‘Cocoa butter’ with ‘propylene glycol’ and ‘avocado’ listed later. Is cocoa butter actually a good HAIR conditioner ( I was under the impression that only certain substances like coconut oil and olive oil actually penetrate hair, won’t cocoa butter just slide down the drain?) or , is it the propylene glycol and the avocado that are the only worthwhile ingredients? The Right Brain responds: We applaud your skeptical approach to reading your conditioner label, Cianyde! But remember that conditioning isn’t just about penetrating hair because most conditioning occurs on the surface. That’s where ingredients like hydrocarbon oils and silicones actually do a great job of smoothing the cuticle to enhance softness, comb ability and shine. Let’s take a look at the ingredients in Jungle Hair. Jungle hair ingredients : Cocoa Butter, Cetearyl Alcohol and Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Propylene Glycol, Avocado Extract, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG-100 Stearate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Perfume, Soya Lecithin, Figs, Bananas, Passion Fruit, Kumquats, Kiwi Fruit, Cetrimonium Bromide, Ylang Ylang Oil, Vetivert Oil, Cypress Oil, Sandalwood Oil, Chlorophyll, Limonene, Linalool Inside out Some oils, like coconut, do penetrate into the cortex where they are able to help strengthen the hair. We can’t find any published data showing penetration of cocoa butter and even if it does penetrate, it’s unlikely to have an effect in a rinse out formula. In a rinse off conditioner the oils are emulsified (in this case by the cetearyl alcohol, sodium lauryl sulfate and glyceryl stearate) and so are more likely to be rinsed away. Conditioner culprit It’s more likely that the cetrimonium bromide is the conditioning culprit. This is a classic old school conditioning agent: a fatty alcohol reacted with nitrogen so it’s substantive on the hair. That means it stays on hair even after rinsing to give the slippery conditioning effect that your hair needs. The Beauty Brains bottom line There’s nothing wrong with Lush Cosmetics Jungle Hair conditioner but don’t get fooled into thinking that it works better just because it contains some natural ingredients. In fact, we’d expect that it wouldn’t work as well as Pantene or Tresemme. Does anyone want to do an experiment? Try Jungle Hair on one side and Pantene on the other. Let us know which you like best.","Does cocoa butter in lush jungle hair really work?","7d2501bb7f16eeadcc93cdc523785ea6bb8a84e4","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2009/05/does-cocoa-butter-in-lush-jungle-hair-really-work/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Is Foundation Powder Bad for My Lungs? by The Beauty Brains K is concerned… As I was applying my loose mineral foundation, and it occurred to me that I was inhaling these fine particles daily. Is this ok for my lungs? Is there any research or testing done on the effects of inhaling these powders daily? Thank you for your help! If it matters- my Coastal Scents foundation contains: Titanium Dioxide, Mica, Iron Oxides, Rice Powder, Zinc Oxide, Boron Nitride,Magnesium Myristate, Kaolin Clay, Ultramarine Blue. (They readily list the ingredients on every product they sell. I appreciate that!) The Right Brain calms K: You’re right to be concerned about the effects of chemicals that enter your body, K, but in this case there is research that indicates foundation powders are safe for every day use. Foundation power peril? There are really two questions here: Do the particles enter your lungs and if they do, are they dangerous? The first question can be answered by looking at particle size. Inhalation is basically a function of size: large particles can’t get into the sensitive areas of your lungs. The general rule of thumb is that particles have to be below 10 microns before they can work their way into your lungs. (For those of you who are metric impaired, a micron is a millionth of a meter. In other words its very very very tiny.) Here’s why: According the National Institute of Health , our respiratory system is pretty good at keeping airborne particles out of our lungs. The upper respiratory system, consisting of the nasal passages, trachea, and associated airways are good filters. Particles 100 microns or larger don’t really enter the airways at all. Particles between 10 and 100 microns get caught on nasal hairs, nasal mucosa, or mucus-covered ciliated epithelium in the bronchi and bronchioles. It’s the stuff thats smaller 10 microns that are able to travel into the alveolar ducts sacs where respiration takes place. What size are powders used in makeup? According to a typical source of cosmetic powders , mica is somewhere in the range of 10 to 60 microns. So there’s little chance it will penetrate deep enough into your lungs to pose a threat. Particles of titanium dioxide, on the other hand, are only about 0.30 microns in diameter which means they are small enough to be inhaled. But that doesn’t automatically mean it presents a health hazard. According the the Annals of Occupational Hygeine , Tio2 has been studied and found not to present an inhalation danger, even in large quantities Similar results were found for zinc oxide , another common ingredient with a particle size of about 0.12 microns. The Beauty Brains bottom line There is research done to ensure that cosmetic powders don’t post a health hazard so there’s not much to be worried about from using foundation powder. If you have specific health concerns our legal eagle, Bird Brain, would encourage you to consult your physician. Or you could just cover your face with one of the stylish hats shown in today’s picture while you apply your foundation powder. What do YOU think? Are you worried about breathing the cosmetics you use every day?

"Randy Schueller","2014-06-28 11:12:00","The shampoo secret beauty companies don’t want you to know by Randy Schueller Conny tells The Beauty Brains she has a very sensitive scalp with fine hair and suffers from hair loss and dandruff. Dermatologists have advised her to use a clear gel shampoo that has to be clarifying or deep cleansing. So, she’s tried Suave Daily Clarifying Shampoo, Suave for Men Deep Cleansing shampoo, Neutrogena Anti-residue shampoo, and Prell Classic original formula. She’s not happy with those choices and is asking us to set her straight. The Right Brain responds: While we hate to disagree with dermatologists, we don’t understand why they recommended a deep cleansing shampoo when you have dandruff. Deep cleansing type shampoos will remove the surface flakes, but only a dandruff shampoo can control the cause of flaking and itching. So we’d recommend finding a good dandruff shampoo instead of chasing deep cleaning, clarifying and anti-residue products. This may seem confusing to you because the beauty companies tell you there are SO many different kinds of shampoo. But in reality, every shampoo on the market falls into a few basic categories. There Are Only 4 Different Shampoo Types In the World All shampoo can be categorized by their basic functional category. So then why are there eleventy million products on the market, you ask? Because the companies that sell shampoo need to find new ways to talk about their products to keep them sounding new and exciting. There’s nothing wrong with them being creative about their names and claims as long as the companies are honestly depicting what their products can do. But you can be a smarter consumer if you can see beyond the marketing hype and understand the functionality of these 4 basic shampoo types. 1) Deep Cleansing Shampoos (Also known as Volumizing, Clarifying, Balancing, Oil Control, and Thickening.) These shampoos are designed to get gunk off your hair and scalp. They typically contain slightly higher levels of detergents so they foam and clean better. They include the examples above as well as salon products like Paul Mitchell Shampoo 2. and Frederic Fekkai’s Full Volume . 2) Conditioning Shampoos (Aka Moisturizing, 2 in 1, Smoothing, Anti-frizz, Strengthening, Color Care, Straightening, and Hydrating) This kind of formula is all about leaving a moisturizing agent, like a silicone or Polyquaternium 10, on the hair to smooth it and help straighten hair . It’s very good for dry hair, especially if you color treat or heat style but it can weigh down fine hair. Good examples of this type includes most of the Pantene formulas and some products from the L’Oreal Vive collection and Dove ProCare . 3) Baby Shampoos (Aka Kids shampoo, and Tear-free ) Johnson’s Baby Shampoo is the classic example but this category also includes Touch Of An Angel and The Little Bath . These are milder, lower foaming surfactant formulas that are designed not to sting or burn your eyes. They’re better for babies but they don’t clean hair as well. 4) Anti-Dandruff Shampoos (Aka Anti-itch, Flake Control, and Dry Scalp) Head and Shoulders is the leading dandruff product; other examples include Nizoral and Redken Dandruff Control . These are medicated shampoos that contain a drug ingredient that controls itching and flaking. In the United States these are considered to be Over-the-Counter (OTC) Drugs. The Brains Bottom Line : Hopefully, this helps you better understand the marketing hype around shampoo names. We’re not saying that all shampoos are the same, or even that all shampoos in a given category type are the same. There are real performance differences, so it’s important that you shop around and find a product that performs the way you like at a price that you can afford. But just don’t get too hung up on the names the companies use to describe the products. That’s the marketing part of the industry, not the science part.","The shampoo secret beauty companies don’t want you to know","6637f700dea863b2c793e4e87e16b40fbdd75497","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2007/03/the-shampoo-secret-beauty-companies-dont-want-you-to-know/"

She gives a couple of great product suggestions, but we thought we’d look at all the ways you can use to stop smelly hair. 1. Wash and condition your hair Yes it’s a lot of work but that’s really the most thorough way to get your hair clean. 2. Use hair wipes Like Are You A Beauty suggests, you can use wipes made especially for hair like Ted Gibson’ s. 3. Use a hair fragrance Beauty likes the one from Cleanperfume.com. If you don’t mind spending $39.00. Ouch! 4. Spritz your hair with your own perfume If you can’t find a “real” hair fragrance just improvise with your fave perfume. Don’t use too much! 5. Use a powder shampoo. Pssst anyone? Or maybe Batiste ? Just spray ‘em in and brush ‘em out. 6. Use a leave-in conditioner or combing cream. A touch of conditioner can mask icky odors. 7. Do a speedy, secret sink wash Wet your hands, take a TINY dab of liquid soap, and run your fingers through your hair. Caution: this doesn’t work on all hairstyles. 8. Wipe your hair with a dryer sheet It’s better than smelling like smoke AND you’ll get rid of embarrassing static cling. 9. Try a little Febreze on your brush At least we THINK this might work. Better check with the manufacturer before you try this one at home! 10. Use an antimicrobial shampoo This can help if you have Smelly Scalp Syndrome which is caused by scalp fungus or bacteria. Yuck!

"The Beauty Brains","","What can I do about blackheads? by The Beauty Brains Ali asks… I was wondering what is the best approach to dealing with blackheads. What are they and what can we do to keep them at bay. Thanks! The Right Brain replies: Ali, there’s really nothing to worry about.Blackheads are just pores on your skin that have a wider than usual opening. And this opening, because it’s so large and gaping, is filled up with “skin garbage” consisting of plugs of sebum and dead skin cells. And this garbage jamming your open skin pores has undergone a series of oxidative chemical reactions that have created a dark, black mass. A deep, dark black mass, like the kind that steals your soul. Steals it and casts it into a pit of despair from which you can never escape. A thick, oozing, throbbing mass of black skin garbage that traps your soul, and…. Oh… sorry. We got carried away there for a moment. Maybe you should worry about blackheads after all. Our dermatologist friends over at acne.com have written a very nice article on what blackheads (also known open comedones) are and what to do about them . The Beauty Brains bottom line: Blackheads are caused by the stuff your skin naturally produces, like oil and dead cells, getting caught in your pores. If you can clean blackheads from your plugged pores , you’ll lessen your chances of getting ugly acne.

"The Beauty Brains","","Does clarsskin underarm cleanser really remove deodorant residue? by The Beauty Brains Forum member tsunamino says …Short of scrubbing, how can you remove deodorant from your underarms at the end of the day? I’ve heard of this one product, Clarsskin that claims to penetrate the residue left behind to clean it off. Here’s what their website says: Clarsskin Underarm Cleanser contains a unique patent pending combination of an effective chelating agent with special agents. This complex mixture is specifically designed to remove antiperspirant deodorant residue, efficiently and mildly. So what’s so special about chelating agents? Chelating agents have the capability of penetrating the residue left behind by antiperspirant deodorants — including the metallic salts they are made of! They do one thing and do it well! Clarsskin Underarm Cleanser is particularly effective with ingredients that are unusually mild but contain no sulfates, paraben and DEA. Of course since it’s “patent pending” they don’t list the ingredients. Is there anything out there that could help to get rid of deodorant? Right Brain clears things up: It’s so rare I get to do any product reviews. Sarah and Mid Brain always seem to get product samples before me. However, this question was for me so too was the sample. What is Clarsskin? At its most basic level, Clarsskin is a body wash. It uses mild surfactants like Decyl Glucoside (derived from sugar) and Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate so it will not be as harsh as sulfate based body washes. The mild surfactants also mean it will not foam as well. The rest of the ingredients are standard. Here’s a complete list of the formula right from the bottle. WATER, DECYL GLUCOSIDE, SODIUM LAUROYL SARCOSINATE, COCAMIDE MEA, HYDROXYETHYLCELLULOSE, ETHYLENE GLYCOL MONOSTEARATE, ALOE BARBADENSIS LEAF JUICE POWDER, ANTHEMIS NOBILIS FLOWER EXTRACT, COCAMIDOPROPYL BETAINE, DISODIUM EDTA, DMDM HYDANTOIN, PROPYLENE GLYCOL, FRAGRANCE How is Clarsskin different? The key Clarsskin claim is that it helps remove residue from your antiperspirant or deodorant. They say that it contains special “chelating agents” that take care of this problem. Is that true? Well, the chelating ingredient they are talking about is Disodium EDTA. It is found in many personal care products for the purpose of both removing metal ions and helping boost the activity of the preservative. It is true that extra chelating ingredients will help improve cleansing. The improvement they provide is not normally noticeable so companies don’t bother putting additional levels in. No data is given on the company website to compare the performance to a standard body wash, but in principle this chelating approach could work because the excess deodorant residue is partially composed of water insoluble metallic salts. Clarsskin Experience Admittedly, this pit problem was foreign to me until getting the Clarsskin sample. I tried the product and there was certainly an effect. My underarms did feel different. Not sure if “cleaner” is the word I’d use but “fresher”. Since I didn’t want to bias the results I applied it without using my usual bathroom poof. In doing it this way, it was much harder to generate a good amount of foam. More foam doesn’t mean it’s cleaning better but it would’ve improved the experience. The packaging is nice. You open it once and then squeeze out the product whenever you need it. It’s a good experience but I’m not sure if I’ll stick with it. I’m not sure if the extra step is worth the extra time. Wonder why they don’t just make a whole body wash with the chelating ingredient in it. hmmm Do you need this product? People with “pit stains” on their favorite blouses could definitely see a benefit from this product. Are you listening Left Brain? You might also see a benefit if you don’t like how your underarms feel, if you scrub extra hard on them or you just can’t seem to get them clean. The extra chelating ingredient could actually help get you cleaner. Beauty Brains Bottom Line: Clarsskin is an interesting product that attempts to solve a problem that affects at least a portion of the population. If you have a problem with stained shirts or just don’t like how your underarms feel, this product is certainly worth a try. We can’t say for sure it will work for you, but there is at least some science suggesting it might. If you want to try Clarsskin yourself, take a look at their website . How big is this problem? Do you think you need an extra product to get your underarms clean?

"The Beauty Brains","2015-09-14 07:22:00","More ways women are better than men by The Beauty Brains I wonder why the Beauty Brains never do studies like this. Here are a few reports that demonstrate some interesting findings about our sense of smell. Women smell better Women are better at smelling things than men. Researchers at the Monell Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia conducted a study to see how well fragrances hid or covered body odor . They took smelly scents and combined them with different perfumes. Out of the 32 fragrances tested, women were only fooled by 2 of them. For men, 19 of the fragrances worked. This explains why your boyfriend thinks his deodorant shower works but you don’t. Scent will tell Researchers also found that women can tell when a man is interested in her from his body odor. You can read the article for the study details but essentially they found women’s brains activated differently when they smelled aroused male sweat versus non-aroused male sweat. The Power of the Pill One final story finding about scent is that women who are on the pill do a worse job of picking a suitable mate than women who are not. Evidently, the pill sets the body’s hormones to a pregnant-like state, significantly inhibiting the ability to sense a suitable mate. If you keep picking the wrong guy, it might be your birth control -Mid Brain Do you have more examples of things you think women can do better than men? Leave a comment.

"The Beauty Brains","","Who is skeptical about sunscreen in their hair products? by The Beauty Brains Rae Requests …Could you please explain more about sunscreen not protecting hair? I’ve always heard that people with color-treated hair should use a product with sunscreen. Can hair products with sunscreen at least help protect the scalp? The Right Brain Retorts: Sunscreens in hair care products don’t really do very much. Read on and we’ll explain, question and answer style: Does sunlight really damage your hair? Yes, but not as much as everything else you do. Even if you protected your hair from 100% of the UV damage it sustains, you’d still have more serious damage from combing, brushing, coloring, and, heck, even washing! Ok, but doesn’t sunscreen help a little? Maybe, if it was applied perfectly. Sunscreens work best when they’re applied in a uniform film. When you put on sun tan lotion you smear a thick layer on and rub it in, right? If you didn’t put on a thick enough layer, or, if you missed some spots, you’d burn. So, unless you have even coverage, sunscreen doesn’t work. And hair is much harder to cover than your skin because you’ve got 100,000 fibers, or more, that need to be completely covered. Unless you totally soak your head in the product it won’t cover adequately. But if I rub it in my hair really well will it work? No, it won’t. Certainly not from a shampoo or conditioner! It’s almost impossible to deposit very much UV absorber from rinse out products. And while there are some sunscreens that are chemically modified so they’ll stick to the hair even after rinsing, not very MUCH sticks, so you’re still left with poor coverage. In theory, leave in products with UV absorbers have a little bit better chance of working. Ok, but let’s say I AM willing to use a leave in product AND I promise to smooth it through my hair so it’s all covered. Then a hair care sunscreen would work, right? Not really because no one makes a product that has enough sunscreen active in it to do the job. If you used sun block for skin and rubbed it into your hair, that might work. At least then you could protect your scalp. Ok, I get the picture. But a sunscreen should give me color protection, right? Doesn’t UV cause fading? Yes it does, but UV light doesn’t cause as much fading as washing does. If you protected your hair from ALL UV light, your hair would still fade about the same amount just from washing. We could talk about how to protect your hair color from washing, but that’s another post… The Beauty Brain’s Bottom Line UV radiation isn’t the worst problem your hair faces. Use a good conditioner before and after spending a lot of time in the sun. But don’t expect a hair sun screen to save you. If you’re really worried about sun damage on your hair, wear a hat.","Who is skeptical about sunscreen in their hair products?","ce98c5d2b7e54bcb6cfd70d257e1be01a75129c2","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2009/05/who-is-skeptical-about-sunscreen-in-their-hair-products/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Is it bad to inhale nail polish fumes? by The Beauty Brains Laura breathes this question : Is inhaling nail polish fumes harmful if you’re exposed to them for about 30 minutes or so per week? The Left Brain exhales this response: Nearly all the popular brands of nail polishes including Revlon and OPI contain organic solvents and methacrylates. The March 2002 issue of Neuropsychiatry, Neuropsychology, & Behavioral Neurology summarizes a study by Gina LaoSasso, Ph.D et.al, that shows prolonged exposure to nail polish fumes can affect the way your brain works. The researchers tested 33 nail-salon technicians compared to the same number of demographically similar control subjects (in other words, women who had no exposure to nail polish or other toxic chemicals.) Both groups were given a series of psychologic, neuropsychologic, and neurosensory tests. Nail Polish Fumes Affect Brain Functions Their study showed three main results: The nail technicians performed statistically worse than the control group on tests that measured attention and brain processing speed. The nail technicians and the control group showed no statistical differences in learning and memory, fine motor coordination, or on measures of depression and anxiety. The nail technicians’ sense of smell was statistically worse than the control group’s. Fresh air, not fumes What does all this mean? Apparently, exposure to enough nail polish fumes can make your brain a little slow and fuzzy. Kinda scary, huh? Unfortunately, the study didn’t provide details on how long this effect lasts so we don’t know if your brain returns to normal once you’ve gotten away from the nail fumes. And while the study did measure the size of the salon, the amount of ventilation, and the number of hours that the technicians worked, the data can’t be used to predict what would happen at a lower exposure. In other words, if you’re in a nail salon long enough, you may experience these problems. But is 30 minutes a week enough to cause an effect? It doesn’t look like it but clearly more studies are needed. In the meantime, make sure you’re getting plenty of fresh air when you’re getting your nails done! Nail color, not die! Note if you happened to be talking about inhaling the fumes on purpose (huffing) we would strongly advise against this. According to this article about huffing “Death from inhalant abuse can occur after a single use or after prolonged use. Sudden sniffing death (SSD) may result within minutes of inhalant abuse from irregular heart rhythm leading to heart failure.” Now, it’s not very likely that you will die but it’s certainly not worth the risk. And in case you weren’t sure, yes, the product pictured above is nail polish for pets.","Is it bad to inhale nail polish fumes?","d37e9fd966150e63aeb021a524f793edd2fcca15","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2007/03/is-it-bad-to-inhale-nail-polish-fumes/"
"The Beauty Brains","","An inexpensive natural wrinkle remover from the dairy case by The Beauty Brains Michelle’s got milk: I am 54 years young and when I was 22 I was told to put buttermilk on my face to get rid of wrinkles. I’ve been using it ever since and there is no question that my skin looks much younger than women my age. I have also stayed out of the sun and don’t smoke and today I also use pricey beauty products like ReVive and Origins. Do you think it’s buttermilk that’s keeping my skin wrinkle free? The Right Brain goes sour: Michelle, thanks so much for your email. We had to edit it to fit today’s post, but we’ve started a forum thread with your entire email in case anyone’s interested in learning more. Now on to your answer… Could buttermilk be responsible for your youthful appearance? Mmmmmmaybe. But doubtful. Here’s why. What the heck is buttermilk, anyway? For those of you who aren’t up to speed on your dairy products, buttermilk is a thickened, sour type of milk that is made by adding bacteria to regular milk. The bacteria cause fermentation which changes the milk sugar (aka lactose) into lactic acid. Sound familiar? It should! Lactic acid is an alpha-hydroxyacid (or AHA) the same chemical that’s used in anti-aging lotions to exfoliate your skin. Unfortunately, it doesn’t look like buttermilk is better than lotions you can buy. Why isn’t buttermilk better? Milk contains 4 to 6% lactose . When it’s converted to buttermilk, you end up with about 3 or 4% lactic acid. Lactic acid skin creams contain about 12% lactic acid, about 3 times as much as buttermilk. So while it’s theoretically possible that buttermilk could be helping, you’d probably see more benefit from a relatively inexpensive lactic acid cream like Lac-hydrin. Wrinkle creams tend to be expensive but do you really need to pay for that? Discover how I get Hydroderm Wrinkle Reducer and moisturizer worth $149 free. I will let you know a secret tip on how you can save 60% off shipping. Interested? Click here for more information about Hydroderm . So, if it’s not the buttermik, why does your skin look good? There could be several other reasons you skin looks so good. First, genetics plays a large role in the health of your skin. It might also be your healthy lifestyle. By staying out of the sun and not smoking you’ve avoided two of the major causes of premature aging. Finally, you said that you’re using other beauty products like Revive and Origins along with the buttermilk. If any of these products contain sunscreen that could be prevent your skin from aging too. But the important thing is – keep up whatever you’re doing. It’s working for you! And if anyone out there is still interested in buttermilk but you don’t like the stench of sourmilk on your face (and gee, who doesn’t want that??) you also might try Burt’s Bees Buttermilk Lotion . It’s 98.31% natural so it MUST be good. Right? The majority of U.S. citizens see the healthy lifestyle as one of the most difficult targets to achieve. Traditional diet and fitness plans have told us that to lose weight means counting calories and taking nutrition vitamins instead of fast food hamburgers. But with the help of tasty nutritional supplements , now you can lose your weight without spoiling your taste.","An inexpensive natural wrinkle remover from the dairy case","36532ba4f185b70f9d66ac463c193546d721cfe1","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2007/08/an-inexpensive-natural-wrinkle-remover-from-the-dairy-case/"

What are they and what can we do to keep them at bay. Thanks! The Right Brain replies: Ali, there’s really nothing to worry about.Blackheads are just pores on your skin that have a wider than usual opening. And this opening, because it’s so large and gaping, is filled up with “skin garbage” consisting of plugs of sebum and dead skin cells. And this garbage jamming your open skin pores has undergone a series of oxidative chemical reactions that have created a dark, black mass. A deep, dark black mass, like the kind that steals your soul. Steals it and casts it into a pit of despair from which you can never escape.

"The Beauty Brains","","Is electrolysis removal of hair safe? by The Beauty Brains Purple Rules asks… I’m thinking of having electrolysis done on my chin and so I was wondering just how painful is it and does it really work? The Right Brain responds: Purple posted this question in our Forum a while ago, but because we just received a press release from a company that specializes in electrolysis we thought it would be a good time to discuss this hair removal technique. Electrolysis removal of hair Electrolysis, for those of you who might not be familiar with the process, involves removing hair by applying electric current to the follicle with a fine needle. The practice dates back to the late 1860s. St. Louis ophthalmologist Charles Michel is credited as one of the pioneers of the method of destroy papillae (vascular connective-tissue structures that enable hair growth) by using thin electrified needles. Today electrolysis is a big business and is taught by various beauty schools across the country. Interestingly, only about 30 states in the US require a license to practice this type of hair removal. You can learn more by visiting the American Electrology Association which is the oldest and largest electrolysis guild in the United States. Electrolysis versus laser The press release we referred to earlier is for the Lucy Peters Integrated System which claims to be “the only FDA approved permanent hair removal treatment.” This was surprising to us because we had assumed that laser treatment was FDA approved. It turns out we were wrong – lasers are not approved for permanent hair removal. They are approved for permanent hair REDUCTION. The distinction may seem like a fine line but basically it means that hair may grow back after laser treatment but after electrolysis it’s gone for good. Perhaps Lucy Peters meant to say that her Integrated System USES the only FDA approved permanent hair removal treatment. But so does any electrolysis process. The Lucy Peters system claims to be different because it uses a different type of needle that give the electrologist added control to remove hair completely without excessive pain and scarring. Excessive is the key word here and implies that some pain is probably normal for different kinds of electrolysis. And speaking of different methods, don’t be tricked by a type of electrolysis known as tweezer electrolysis which involves using tweezers to grab the hair close to the skin while electric current is applied. This method is a bit of a scam. According to the FDA, “there is no body of significant information establishing the effectiveness of the tweezer epilator to permanently remove hair.” You can click the link to learn more about what the FDA says about hair removal. The Beauty Brains bottom line Electrolysis is a safe and effective method of permanent hair removal but the results you experience can vary tremendously based on the skill of the operator and the type of equipment used. For more background, here’s an excellent article from the American Council on Science and health about electrolysis safety.","Is electrolysis removal of hair safe?","7871889dca856acc7304ea2a684e9674f3bc51fa","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2009/04/is-electrolysis-removal-of-hair-safe/"
"The Beauty Brains","","How does Murad Oil Control Mattifier work? by The Beauty Brains Brenda is bemused…. Do products that claim to reduce shiny skin oiliness really work? I was thinking of buying Murad Oil Control but I don’t want to get scammed. Can the Beauty Brains please enlighten me? The Right Brain replies: We always encourage the Beauty Brains community to be on skeptical alert for products that sound too good to be true, so we’d be glad to try to shine some light on the shine control claims of Murad. Oil Control Claims This product is a lotion that claims to provide sun protection and oil control. The sun protection part is easy: it contains 3 different FDA approved sunscreens so there’s no issue there. Understanding oil control is a bit more slippery. According to Murad’s website , Oil-Control Mattifier SPF 15 “reduces shine on contact and keeps skin free of excess oil by up to 78% for 8 hours. Oil-Control Complex helps regulate oil production while preserving moisture to provide a long-lasting matte finish.” That’s a pretty impressive claim, but is there any science behind this so called oil control complex? Active ingredients Three of the ingredients in Murad Oil Control (Argania Spinosa Kernel Extract, Serenoa Serrulata Fruit Extract, Sesamum Indicum (Sesame) Seed Extract), comprise a complex sold by the Centerchem company called “Regu-Seb.” According to their website Regu-seb is made of “polyphenolrich fractions from the fruits of the North American saw palmetto and South American sesame seeds in a Moroccan argan oil base. Its perfectly balanced polyphenol formula, consisting mostly of lignans and phytosterols, helps to control and reduce sebum production, especially in the T-zone area of the face.” Centerchem cites two research studies. The first is an in vitro study done on reconstructed epidermis that shows a dose-response-dependent inhibition of dihydrotestosteron (DHT) synthesis by Regu-Seb. Results showed that at 1% the complex could inhibit DHT synthesis 35% vs. control. (DHT is a chemical that’s involved in oil production in skin.) The second study was done in vivo and showed that at 5% concentration, a cream with 5% of the complex reduced the severity of seborrheic skin condition by 46% (after 30 and 90 days.) If this data is valid, there does appear to be some basis for this complex reducing oil production. It does make me wonder about the Moroccan oil too. Does Murad Oil Control really work? The fact that the supplier has data showing the complex has some effect between 1% and 5% is very encouraging but it isn’t conclusive proof of efficacy. We have no way of knowing the concentration of Regu-seb in the Murad product and we don’t know how the Murad base might effect the efficacy of the complex. But there does appear to be some science behind this proposition so we’d give Murad Oil Control a rating of: 3 Brains The Beauty Brains bottom line Unlike products that make “magic” claims like erasing deep wrinkles, Murad Oil Control Mattifier claims seem to have some basis in science considering the data we’ve been able to find.

"The Beauty Brains","","Do Wexler Products protect skin from MMPs? by The Beauty Brains Darla Dares To Ask: I love shopping in Bath and Body Works , and this year when I go in there has been a lot of hype about their Wexler line of anti-aging skincare line. And they tell me about MMPs and MMPIs and how this is supposed to be a revolutionary skincare line. Is it really worth the hype and is it worth the money to help ease the signs of aging? The Right Brain Responds: What are MMPs and Why Are They Bad? MMP stands for Matrix Metalloproteinases which are naturally produced enzymes that help regulate the skin`s ability to repair itself. MPPi stands for Matrix Metalloproteinase Inhibitor, in other words, an agent that prevents MMPs from forming. There are many types of MMPs, and while the function of all of them is not fully understood, it appears that several of them can degrade collagen and elastin which give skin its structure and firmness. Other MMPs play a role in inflammatory skin conditions like acne . These bad MMPs increase as you age and with exposure to environmental stressors. High MMP activity can result in wrinkles, loss of firmness, and dull, uneven skin tone. Enter Dr. Patricia Wexler. She claims that her Wexler line of products use MMP Inhibitors to help skin`s own regenerating powers to interrupt damage and inflammation that leads to the most common skin concerns. She references studies which shows her products do indeed inhibit MMP production. Can Cosmetics Really Protect You From MMPs? According to Dr. Wexler’s website, she has done studies to show that her MMPi technology really works. The data on the website shows that she meastured a reduction in MMP production but there’s no data on how the skin itself was affected. In other words, did she prove her products have a beneficial effect on skin or did she only prove her products react a certain way in laboratory tests? Since she only references the studies and doesn’t actually link to them, it’s impossible to tell exactly what her studies do or don’t prove. So is there any unbiased, peer review data to suggest what Wexler says is true? Sort of. This article from Pubmed shows research that indicates treatment with isotretinoin (the drug Accutane) can reduce two types of MMPs (MMR9 and 13) and that may be the mechanism by which Accutane works. Of course, Accutane is a prescription drug so you won`t find it in a cosmetic product. And while this study appears to validate that certain MMPs might play a role in acne, it doesn`t prove that MMPi’s can help fight wrinkles. Other than this study, we couldn’t find much to back up Dr. Wexler’s theories. But, we admit there is a lot of research on MMPs and it’s impossible for us to research ALL the studies that have been done. The Brain’s Bottom Line Scientists seem to agree that MMPs do play a role in various skin conditions, but we haven’t been able to find any data to show that MMP Inhibitors used in cosmetic products show a consumer perceivable benefit. Until we see some more data, we’re in agreement with The Cosmetic Cop who wrote a nice summary of these cell-communicating ingredients . She concluded that currently, there’s no solid research that shows these peptide-based ingredients perform as indicated by their claims.","Do Wexler Products protect skin from MMPs?","a3812482c404300e566b4c06a66529d153e1551b","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2007/02/do-wexler-products-protect-skin-from-mmps/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Buy Better Buttocks with a Brazilian Butt Lift by The Beauty Brains Claire’s question: My sister Grace told me she’s considering a plastic surgery procedure to improve her posterior. What can you tell me about the Brazilian Butt Lift? The Right Brain butts in: Claire, normally we try to focus on cosmetic products, but it’s hard to resist an email that combines the terms “Brazilian” and “Butt” in the same question. So, we checked with our favorite cosmetic surgeon, Dr. Tony Youn , for the 411 on butt lifting. What is a Brazilian Butt Lift? As the name implies, it’s a procedure to shape and firm your derrière. We wonder why it’s named after this particular country. Was it first performed by doctors in Brazil? Do Brazilian women have genetically superior asses? Or is the process some how related to Brazil nuts? We can only speculate… Whatever the derivation of its name, a BBL is designed to give you “youthful, prominent, perky buttocks.” How does it work? Fat grafting! That means the surgeon uses liposuction to remove fat from your lower back, stomach and thighs. The fat is purified and then re-injected into different areas of your buttocks at various depths. It may take hundreds of tiny injections to fill the upper quadrant of your buttocks but when done correctly it does make your butt look better. But a poor injection job can be painful and produce fat shapeless buttocks. Are there any problems with this perky pooper procedure? Aside from the aforementioned shapeless buttocks, other side effects include irregular asymmetric skin, numbness, bruising and swelling. On occasion, the incisions may ooze significant fluid. And since the doctor may need to overfill your buttocks to allow for some fat re-absorption back into your body, your butt may temporarily look puffy or swollen. The good news is that unlike silicone butt implants, there is no risk of allergic reaction since the fat injections are your own natural substance. To avoid some of these issues Dr Youn says: “My favorite way to enhance the buttocks, however, is to liposuction the hips and thighs around it. This essentially makes everything around it smaller, and can indirectly make the bottom look bigger and rounder compared to the rest of the body. It doesn’t take as much time, has few complications, and allows the patient to sit down immediately.” How many bucks will it cost to lift my butt?

"The Beauty Brains","","Is No Poo Nonsense? by The Beauty Brains Indigo inquires… I’ve been reading a lot of positive stories online from people who have stopped using shampoo, and am wondering if I should try it. The people who seem to have the most positive experiences doing this have curly, dry, or frizzy hair, none of which are true for me. However, some people also counter-intuitively say that this technique also benefits greasy hair. The claim is that when too much of your natural oil is cleaned off, your sebaceous glands detect that there is not enough and will overproduce oil to compensate. Therefore, if you stop cleaning the oil from your hair, your glands will eventually stop this overproduction and your hair will stop being greasy. The Left Brain responds: There was a lot of interesting discussion on this topic in our Forum , but the quick answer is that the no-poo shampoo method does actually clean hair. But instead of high foaming detergents, it just uses the emulsifying surfactants used in hair conditioner to do the cleaning. This means it won’t be as stripping and your hair won’t “feel” as clean. Whether you should try it or not is up to you. I would suggest you do. I personally tried it for one month. It worked well but I missed the foaming of shampoo and the feeling of being clean. Many people just get used to the heavier feeling of no-poo washing and love it. As far as the “health” of your hair goes, the benefit to no-poo washing is that your hair may be slightly less damaged but not much. The detergents in shampoos can strip the hair of naturals oils and cause it to dry out. But it’s also damaging just to manipulate ANY product on wet hair (that’s when hair is weakest). And the drying process is even more damaging! What do you think? Do you No Poo?

"The Beauty Brains","","Girl power, sweaty science style by The Beauty Brains Mid Brain muses: The latest issue of of the Flavour and Fragrance Journal reveals that women are better than men when it comes to sniffing out body odor. According to researchers at the Monell institute, it’s tougher to block a woman’s sensitivity to body odor than it is for men. How do scientists know this? By sniffing vials of underarm sweat collected in the laboratory from volunteers, of course! Sweaty sniffing The researchers had both men and women rate the strength of underarm orders to get a Body Odor baseline. BO was rated equally strong by both sexes. Then they added different fragrances to the underarm extractions to mimic the effect of deodorants. For men, 19 of the 32 scents did a good job of covering up the body odor. In other words, it was pretty easy to fool men’s sense of smell. The women, on the other hand, were only fooled by 2 of the 32 fragrances. You go girl! Also intriguing was the fact that women reacted differently to male and female body odors. Males scents were harder to block than female odors. Less then 20% of the fragrances could block male odors while over 50% decreased intensity of female underarm odor. So not only are women better able to detect quantitative differences in body odor, but they’re able to detect qualitative differences as well. (Hmmm, I wonder if they tested the odor of boob sweat .) What does this mean? The researchers theorize that women’s sense of smell has evolved to help us pick a mate by extracting biologically relevant information from sweat. According to the head researcher, “Taken together, our studies indicate that human sweat conveys information that is of particular importance to females. This may explain why it is so difficult to block women’s perception of sweat odors.” Does this means that Axe Body Spray is wasting their money on those silly ad campaigns?

"The Beauty Brains","2016-07-01 08:18:00","What makes my eyes puffy? by The Beauty Brains Dusk Lace has a question: I adore your blog! You are my everyday-must-read! I have a question on puffy under-eye-bags. Almost everyday, I have these terrible puffy bags under my eyes. People tell me to drink more water and use a firm pillow, but the more water I drink everyday (at night), I wake up with a more severe under-eye-bags. I was wondering are there any ingredients that would help to relieve the bags? I`ve been using Benefit`s Depuffy Action Gel and I don`t see the long last effect in this product. This makes me think that is there any real treatment product out there (not temporary relief ones, like Benefit)? The Right Brain`s Reply: Thanks for the question, Lacey. We’ve seen over 150 different products that claim to make your eyes look better, but we`ve never seen evidence that any of these depuffers” really work. We’ve even heard of using hemorrhoid cream on under eye bags! Our favorite is Eyederma because it contains the magic ingredient “Ocupeptide-3. We’ve never heard of this particular chemical but we assume the name comes from “Ocu” because it sounds like “ocular,” “peptide” because EVERYONE knows peptides are good for you, and “-3″ because numbers always give a product that extra-special scientific cache. Ok, all sarcasm aside, we can’t give you a magic product to make your bags go away, but we can help explain why your eyes puff up in the first place. Once again, we turn to our Guest Blogger Dr. Michael Breus, PhD, author of the book Good Night: The Sleep Doctor`s 4-Week Program to Better Sleep and Better Health. Take it away, Dr. Breus: Why Your Eyes Get Puffy Awakening to puffy, swollen eyes is frustrating, especially when you know there’s no simple 10-minute solution that will get you out the door looking brand new. Puffiness or bags under the eyes can be caused by several factors: fluid retention, irritation causing inflammation, loss of skin firmness and elasticity as we age, allergies, eye disorders secondary to medical disorders, fat deposits, and fatigue. Several of these triggers come from poor sleep. Excess fluid (edema) under the eye is one of the major causes of eye “puffiness,” and an increase in blood pressure is the likely culprit for many as a direct consequence to sleep deprivation. An elevated blood pressure causes vessels to constrict and invite fluid retention. Many of the known sleep disorders can also cause excess fluid or edema to occur not only in the eye area but in several parts of the body. Is it possible for a person with retained fluid to reduce that baggage and puffiness under the eyes with getting a good night’s sleep over time? Certainly. And if you can reduce the fluid retention, you’ll also change the surrounding tissues for the better, especially since the accumulated excess fluid in the under-eye area may cause additional inflammation and swelling. Medical conditions can also change the appearance of the eye, particularly thyroid problems like hypothyroidism (which can also be linked to sleep apnea). For most, however, getting enough sleep is all that’s necessary. Avoiding excess alcohol will also alleviate eye bags (as well as disrupted sleep!). Attention allergy sufferers : Those with allergies typically have issues with puffy, inflamed eyes. They also face the challenge of getting quality sleep when bothered by allergies during the night. Sometimes taking anti-histamines can help to reduce baggy eyes, but this can come with a hefty price-tag because these medications can cause daytime sleepiness. What’s worse, the act of coughing and sneezing itself can cause forced air to escape through the sinuses. This, in turn, pushes air behind the fat pockets under the eyes, which then causes those fat pockets to protrude forward. Ask your doctor how best to manage your allergies so they don’t interfere with sleep, and neither does your medication. Fat Pockets? Isn`t that one of those microwavable snack foods? Oh, that`s Hot Pockets . Nevermind.But seriously, thanks again to Dr. Breus for the teaching us about puffy eyes.

"The Beauty Brains","","How to avoid armpit irritation by The Beauty Brains Bunny’s bushy question: I’ve tried different ways of shaving my armpits and always it results in the same thing – sore, and little red spots. What else can I do? The Right Brain’s reply: Why is shaving irritating? One of the reasons that shaving can irritate your pits is that you’re not just removing hair you’re also shredding your skin. In a study published in the Journal of the Society of Cosmetic Chemists (Vol 58 No 3 May/June 2007), researchers measured the amount of Underarm Shaving Debris generated during shaving. (Underarm Shaving Debris I love that term!) They found that 36% of the stuff you’re scraping off your armpit is skin, not hair! No wonder shaving is so irritating! They also measured the skin underneath the arms and found that it actually grows thicker to compensate for all this scraping. That’s right, shaving your armpits gives you thicker skin! (I’m not sure why, but that creeps me out just a little bit.) How can you soothe your pits? Even though your skin grows thicker, it’s not enough prevent all the symptoms of irritation. But the researchers did discover that using a special roll-on anti-perspirant formulation with glycerol and sunflower seed oil after shaving can further reduce the irritation. The notion of using a lubricating anti-perspirant as a post-shaving aid is intriguing but this research is so new we don’t know if this type of formula is actually on the market yet or not. We’re looking forward to trying it AND to find out if this new technology reduces the irritation properties of the anti-perspirant itself. (The aluminum salts used in APs can be irritating even if you don’t shave!) In the meantime, make sure you’re using a good razor like Schick , Gillette , or Body Bare .

"The Beauty Brains","2016-01-12 08:28:00","How can I treat back acne? by The Beauty Brains Pam Ponders… I have a persistent back acne problem and my dermatologist recommended Clindamycin solution and Ketoderm cream to treat it. Do they really work? How? (By the way my back acne has not improved at all). The Right Brain responds: Clindamycin is an antibiotic cream that is frequently prescribed for severe acne. Why? Because one of the causes of acne is bacteria and antibiotics kill bacteria. So, although not everyone responds the same, it does make sense to try it as a treatment approach. Ketoderm is an antifungal cream, which is not typically used as a treatment for acne since acne is not caused by a fungus. The Beauty Brains are not doctors and we’d never contradict something your doctor tells you, but you might ask why he or she is prescribing an antifungal for a non-fungal induced condition. Here’s another over the counter treatment you might try: According to acne-resource.org concentrated Benzoyl Peroxide (10%) is good for bacne, as they call it. While this high dosage might irritate your face, the skin on your back is thicker and less likely to be irritated. Finally, you might try changing your wardrobe.

"The Beauty Brains","","The wrong way to apply sunscreen by The Beauty Brains Angelica Asks: I`ve always wondered about the process of applying sunscreen to my face each morning and thought you might be able to help me with my quandary. When applying a moisturizer separately from sunscreen which goes on first? I`ve heard conflicting theories for years and I would love to know once and for all. Moisturizer first, sunscreen second or is it sunscreen first, moisturizer second? Help! The Right Brain Replies: There`s no way we can give one answer that covers all possible combinations of facial moisturizers and sunscreen formulas. However, we can give you some tips: 3 Things You Need To Know About Applying Sunscreen Some ingredients used in certain lotions can inhibit the way sunscreen ingredients deposit/spread on the skin. Based on this fact, we recommend applying sunscreen first to make sure that nothing interferes with the deposition of the active ingredient. If you are applying a product on top of the sunscreen, it`s best to wait a little while before applying the second product. Try applying the sunscreen as the first step in your post-cleaning routine, then do the rest of your beauty business. Finally, come back and apply your facial moisturizer. This will give the sunscreen time to soak in and minimize the change for negative interaction. To save time and effort, you could solve your problem by using a moisturizer with sunscreen in it, like Eucerin Extra Protective Moisture Lotion, SPF 30 or Cetaphil Daily Facial Moisturizer SPF 15 . That’s probably the best approach because the sunscreen active has been tested with the rest of the ingredients in the formula.","The wrong way to apply sunscreen","128c722bff1debb070dc23e0a3bcb09bf9852ac2","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2007/02/the-wrong-way-to-apply-sunscreen/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Why body mint is a disappoint-mint by The Beauty Brains Jennifer wants an odor eater: I’m intrigued by a product called Body Mint, which claims that it reduces body odor of all kinds (underarm, breath, foot) from the inside out using chlorophyll. Is this a scam? The Left Brain clears the air: What is Bodymint? As you can see from their website, Body Mint tablets “are made from an all-natural, highly specialized, derivative of chlorophyll” and their “unique formulation give it the uncommon power to reduce body odors from multiple sources, like bad breath, underarm and foot odor.” Sounds good, eh? But anything that sounds too good to be true usually is. Here’s the real scoop: What is chlorophyll? It’s the pigment that gives plants their green color. But more importantly, it allows them to use sunlight to manufacture the carbohydrates that all living things use as food. It can do this because the chemical bonds in the chlorophyll molecule can absorb visible light. What does chlorophyll supposedly do? According to one health food store pamphlet, chlorophyll can help cure trench mouth, tonsillitis, vaginitis, bladder diseases, high blood pressure, tooth decay, arthritis, athlete’s foot, constipation, rectal fissures and laryngitis. It also helps destroy bacteria and soothe gunshot wounds. I’m no doctor, but it seems to me that if you’re suffering from rectal fissures and gunshot wounds, a little bad breath is the LEAST of your problems! What does chlorophyll really do? Not much, according to Quackwatch , a scientific website that specializes in debunking false claims. Read for yourself… Most claims that chlorophyll products can heal, kill bacteria, and remove odors are based on research performed early in the 20th century, before antibiotics were available to fight infections. Although many of these studies are considered invalid by modern scientific standards, there is evidence that chlorophyll can kill certain types of bacteria. It is not a practical choice, however, because very high concentrations are needed for any positive effect and modern antibiotics are far more effective anyway. Also, although chlorophyll kills some bacteria, it actually promotes the growth of others. What about deodorizing properties? Despite the sales hype, in products sold to the public, it doesn’t have any. According to John C. Kephart, who performed studies at the laboratories of The National Chlorophyll and Chemical Company about 20 years ago, “No deodorant effect can possibly occur from the quantities of chlorophyll put in products such as gum, foot powder, cough drops, etc. To be effective, large doses must be given internally” [Journal of Ecological Botany 9:3, 1955]. So, Jennifer, it looks like BodyMint is a scam. Don’t throw away your Listerine mouthwash or your Degree deodorant! Why should you believe our brainy bashing of Body Mint? The source of these Quackwatch quotes is an article written by Dr. Lowell who, at the time, was Professor of Life Sciences at Pima Community College in Tucson, Arizona and vice-president of the National Council Against Health Fraud.","Why body mint is a disappoint-mint","de89444d48fa591c9e58f0c22f78e2b48ec422bf","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2007/07/why-body-mint-is-a-disappoint-mint/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Are ceramic and ionic hair dryers different? by The Beauty Brains Lux would like to learn… What is the benefit to using an ionic hair dryer or a ceramic hair dryer? I’ve heard that you can blow dry more quickly by using an ionic or ceramic dryer. Is this true? How does it work? The Right Brain accommodates: The quick answer is that “ionic” doesn’t mean anything in terms of speed of hair drying. Ionic refers to the charged components that a chemical can be broken down to. For example, when table salt (sodium chloride) dissolves in water you get sodium ions and chloride ions. Ions can also be released under conditions of high temperature or high energy. But even if your blow dryer did bombard your hair with ions, those charged particles wouldn’t have any effect on how long it takes your hair to dry. Ceramic dryers (meaning dryers with a ceramic heating element) can heat up faster and more evenly than some other types, so maybe your hair will dry a little quicker because of that. But that’s only because you spend less time waiting for the dryer to warm up. And that’s not very much time! The Beauty Brains bottom line We haven’t seen any data to show that ionic hair drying appliances are better than any other kind. But ceramic dryers might offer you a faster, more consistent heat source. If any of our Beauty Brainiacs (as we affectionately refer to our readers) have experience with ionic or ceramic dryers, please let us know. (BTW, is it my imagination or is the woman in this picture having just a little too much fun with that hair dryer device?)","Are ceramic and ionic hair dryers different?","457b621a10bfac3a016562112774173ccf3ffa38","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2010/02/are-ceramic-and-ionic-hair-dryers-different/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Is a tourmaline ceramic flat iron better for your hair? by The Beauty Brains We’re having a lot of fun posting tweeting to our top 100 beauty friends on Twitter and we’re getting some good questions from our followers. Here’s one example: NM tweets…Any insight to new technology in flat-irons: nano fusion, far-infrared heat, crushed tourmaline, ionic and effects on hair? The Left Brain leaps to respond: Here are some specific flat iron claims that NM questioned along with my comments. 1. Tourmaline technology produces up to 20 times more moisture-locking ions than other professional irons. Being solid ceramic versus a coat of ceramic, it allows for more crushed tourmaline gemstones, thus producing more negative ions and creating shinier, silkier, and more reflective hair.” There is no scientific evidence that I could find which would support the 20 times claim or an indication of what ions are formed. The only reference I could find was that it produced Hydroxyl ions when put in contact with the water. There is no evidence that these ions have ANY positive effect on hair. More important for characteristics like shine, silky feel and reflectiveness is the condition of the hair. If the hair is not damaged, it will look shinier & feel smoother. Ions have nothing to do with it. 2. “Tourmaline is a natural source of negative ions.” What ions? Ions have to be some kind of element or compound. There is no such thing as “negative ions”. There are “negative hydroxyl ions” or “negative chlorine ions” but there are no “negative ions”. I can’t refute or confirm without an indication of what kind of negative ions they are talking about. 3. What’s the difference between ceramic and tourmaline? Ceramic is a material composed usually of clay. Tourmaline is a silicate, precious stone. They are just different types of inorganic materials. 4. “Ionic technology emits negative ions, which neutralize the positive ions that cause static in the hair. It breaks down water molecules to 100 times smaller, allowing moisture to easily and quickly absorb into each strand, therefore creating softer, smoother hair.” No, this isn’t true. Water molecules are not made smaller. Water molecules stay the same size. There is no published scientific report to demonstrate that Tourmaline irons create less static than ceramic ones. 5. “Hair carries a positive electrical charge caused by dryness. Over time this positive charge increases, and as hair becomes drier, the more open the cuticle becomes. When a flat iron or hair dryer is heated, negative ions are created, canceling out the positive charges and smoothing the hair cuticle.” Hair carries both a positive and negative charge but it’s not “caused” by dryness. It is the result of damaged proteins which can be caused by heat damage, styling damage, environmental damage, sun damage, etc. It’s not true the the cuticle becomes more open because of ions and it’s also not true that “canceling positive charges smooths down the cuticle”. 6. “Far Infrared Heat – This technology heats the hair from the inside out, causing less surface damage. Said to straighten hair faster hence reducing damage.” No it doesn’t. These flat irons work the same as regular flat irons. They transfer heat from the surface through the hair not the other way around. There is no proof that they work different. 7. “Is Far Infra-Red heat more energy efficient? Does it really heat hair from the inside out – is that even possible?” These flat irons do not heat the hair from the inside out. I suppose it would be possible to heat the hair from the inside out, but I’ve never seen a flat iron that actually does. And even if you could do it, there is no evidence that it would make a noticeable difference. 8. “The Ionic Energy and the Silver Nano Technology kills 99.9% of bacteria and air born viruses. “ And, if nanotechnology is generally used in conjunction with silver, how does that figure in to a ceramic plate iron? And how/why is it known for its natural anti-bacterial and antifungal properties? I have no idea what technology they are talking about. The heat from ANY flat iron will kill bacteria and viruses. Nano technology won’t make a bit of difference. Silver is known to have antibacterial properties. But I don’t understand what exactly is the benefit of a flat iron killing bacteria and viruses?","Is a tourmaline ceramic flat iron better for your hair?","cdc5069add8b2cd9bdf5579a3d46b975fc7ef4bb","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2009/04/is-a-tourmaline-ceramic-flat-iron-better-for-your-hair/"
"The Beauty Brains","None","Did the beauty brains botch their arbonne review by The Beauty Brains Some time ago one the lovely members of The Beauty Brains community asked our opinion of Arbonne skin care products . We happily investigated the company and products and concluded that Arbonne products were not much different compared to the stuff you could buy in a regular store. Well, commenter Heather disagreed and posted the following comments… I’m very surprised that you didn’t dig deeper to find out what really makes Arbonne different. If women are indeed coming to you for advice, you should take the time to investigate better. Did you know that just about everything (I don’t know of anything that isn’t) you buy at the grocery store is A) Tested on animals B) Made with animal products/by-products (Look up ‘rendering plants’) C) “Hypoallergenic”… which means that even if 6 people react during testing, you can still label it “Hypoallergenic”. Arbonne tests 10 and if 1 reacts, it’s back to research! That’s only 3 flaws in your argument, there are more. I’m very skeptical about skin-care and nutrition and having worked for Lancome, Mary-Kay and Arbonne, I know a little about the different companies. Trusting women deserve the truth from you. The Beauty Brains respond Hello Heather, Thanks so much for your comments and insight. We completely agree that trusting women deserve the truth from us. That’s exactly why we stand behind everything here that we wrote about Arbonne and their products . Based on their reported ingredient lists, our own product evaluations and our knowledge of how the beauty industry (and cosmetic chemistry) works, we do not believe Arbonne products are anything special. As to your specific claims. Arbonne and animals 1. Did you know that just about everything you buy at a grocery store is tested on animals? This isn’t exactly true. MOST finished formulas are NOT tested on animals. See this previous post on animal testing . Companies realize that this is a PR nightmare so they don’t test their final formulas on animals. Of course, all of the ingredients they use ARE tested on animals so they can get around the problem of selling safe products. But Arbonne does exactly the same thing. Every ingredient listed on Arbonne’s skin lotion has been tested on animals by the people who supply their raw materials. 2. Did you know that just about everything you by at a grocery store is made with animal products/by-products? This is just wrong. Many things bought at grocery stores are made by companies that specifically avoid using animal products/by-products in them. In fact, lots of cosmetic raw material suppliers no longer promote animal derived ingredients. They focus on plant derived and synthetic chemicals. Perhaps there was a time that this was true, but times have changed. Sure, you can still find animal derived ingredients in grocery store products but there are plenty of companies who’ve stopped using them altogether. It’s not surprising that you don’t know these facts about grocery store products because you are not in the lab working with raw material suppliers to get a full understanding of how cosmetic formulating works. Arbonne Claims 3. Hypoallergenic doesn’t mean anything. It is just a made-up word by marketers and can be said about any formula. Even if 5 out of 10 people react during testing you can label it hypoallergenic. First, of all, we agree that the term hypoallergenic is not very technically useful. There are no specific guidelines that the industry uniformly follows. About all it means is that the company has done some kind of irritation test. But second, and most importantly, it’s curious you suggest that no one would have a reaction to Arbonne products. In the lotion featured in this post, Quaternium-15 is used. Did you know that Quat-15 is a preservative that works by releasing Formaldehyde? While this is a perfectly good preservative, there will be some people that will have a negative reaction to it. If Arbonne is using this ingredient, some people will have a negative reaction to it. Feel free to show us the other flaws in our review. We are always open to different opinions. But if you do, please provide some researched facts to back up your statements. The three claims you’ve made about Arbonne products are just not supportable.","Did the beauty brains botch their arbonne review","e6843358b69639d7a1cc2a4c566c712d660981cc","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2007/02/did-the-beauty-brains-botch-their-arbonne-review/"
"The Beauty Brains","2016-05-04 13:50:00","Does egg white give you smoother skin? by The Beauty Brains Katherine’s question: I read that you can get smoother skin by rubbing egg white on your face and letting it dry. I tried it and I could feel my skin noticeably tighten – like I imagine Botox feels. Why does this work? The Right Brain tightens up this response: What is an egg white? Egg white, technically known as albumen, is the clear, liquidy part of the egg that provides nourishment for the growing embryo. It consists of proteins (about 15%) dissolved in water. What happens when you cook an egg? When you cook an egg, a chemical reaction causes these proteins to denature, which is a fancy way of saying they react with each other and become less soluble in water. So they turn from a clear, liquidy solution to a white, congealed solid (or goo, depending on how you cook your eggs.) What happens when you put egg on your face? A similar process occurs as a thin film of egg white dries out. In this case, the protein forms a film as water evaporates. The film is what makes your skin feel tight. It’s kind of like putting a coat of paint on your face and letting it dry. Does egg white give you smoother skin? Although it gives you a temporary feeling of tightness, once you you wash the egg white away, the film is gone. So although this tightening effect makes you think it’s doing something special, there’s really no significant benefit to this kind of facial. It doesn’t get rid of wrinkles like Retin-A does! And by the way, just in case your boyfriend brings it up, Sarah Bellum wants you to know that other kinds of protein facials don’t really do anything for your skin either. (Ok Sarah, are you happy now??)","Does egg white give you smoother skin?","f3f0e7361ded60d6bd95d0dbb9428ca49df48a25","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2007/07/does-egg-white-give-you-smoother-skin/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Why Guys May Like You Better if You Don’t Wear Perfume by The Beauty Brains In a study that’s sure to be controversial, the journal Psychological Science reports (via Science Daily ) that women may be wasting billions of dollars every year on perfume, because the natural odor may be more attractive to men. Periodic perfumery The study was designed to test the hypothesis that male testosterone levels can be effected by odor signals from females, especially during ovulation. The researchers had male volunteers sniff tee shirts worn by women in different phases of their menstrual cycles. The amount of testosterone in the men’s saliva was then measured. The results showed that guys who smelled the shirts of ovulating women had more testosterone in their spit. Even more interesting, these guys rated the odor of the shirts worn by ovulating women as more pleasant. The researchers speculate that this biological reaction may be driven by some kind of mating behavior. Does this mean you shouldn’t wear perfume during your period?","Why Guys May Like You Better if You Don’t Wear Perfume","9c581d4788e3f9a2ec07144ff009a017856db932","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2010/02/why-guys-may-like-you-better-if-you-dont-wear-perfume/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Will oil get silicone buildup out of my hair? by The Beauty Brains EF asks: “Can coconut oil remove silicones from hair? I use ˜cone-free shampoos and conditioners, but my detangler does have ˜cones so I’m worried about buildup. I don’t want to use a clarifying shampoo (like Frederic Fekkai’s Apple Cider Shampoo) because it’s too harsh. Can I use coconut oil to get rid of the ˜cones instead?” The Right Brain Responds: Coconut oil is a good moisturizer for hair (it’s one of the few oils that have shown to penetrate into the cortex. What, you didn’t know that? Then you should have read our previous coconut oil post! ) However, natural oils are NOT good solvents for silicone. That’s because plant and mineral oils are based on carbon while silicone is based on the element Silicon. Just like oil and water, oil and silicone don’t mix. So, you’ll still need to use some kind of shampoo to wash those ‘cones out. The good news is, most light detanglers don’t use the high molecular weight silicones that give you the buildup. A regular shampoo should be fine for you. If your current detangler is too heavy, change to one that doesn’t have dimethicone.","Will oil get silicone buildup out of my hair?","44b1e6cfd4ae8f29273bf2dc6ed714d33523c30f","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2009/04/will-oil-get-silicone-buildup-out-of-my-hair-2/"
"The Beauty Brains","","What To Do About a Red Blotchy Face by The Beauty Brains Debbie has a problem with red, broken capillaries on her face. She saw an ad for Dr.Hauschka Rose Day Cream that said that it would help with this problem so she’s asking us if it works before she spends a small fortune for it. The Right Brain Responds: The Cause of Broken Capillaries The problem you describe is a condition called telangiectasia . The blood vessels are probably not broken, it’s more likely that they’re just enlarged which makes them more visible through the skin. Some forms of telangiectasia are caused by diseases or other medical conditions. If this is the case for you, you should consult your physician. But other cases of telangiectasia have no clear cause. These are termed Generalized Essential Telangiectasia (or GET for short.) How To GET Rid Of Visible Blood Vessels If GET is what you’ve got, you should ask your Derm if you’re a candidate for laser phototherapy. This kind of treatment has been shown to be helpful. But according to the research we’ve seen , there are no topical treatments that are proven to get rid of GET. Interestingly, in at least a few cases, antibiotics (like tetracycline) and antiviral drugs (like Acyclovir) have been helpful in clearing up GET. Again, ask your doctor. The Beauty Brains Bottom Line: Dr. Hauschka’s Rose Day Cream may be a perfectly fine facial moisturizer, but there’s no credible scientific reason that it should help your “broken” blood vessels.","What To Do About a Red Blotchy Face","81e1f2905a873bffa98f167e59b5ecc0f093ed8d","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2007/02/what-to-do-about-a-red-blotchy-face/"
"The Beauty Brains","","The latest breatkthrough in skin care – from the produce department by The Beauty Brains Kaitlyn’s question: I know you say that chemical ingredients work better on your skin, but aren’t there ANY natural ingredients that are really good for you? The Left Brain’s fruity reply: I’ve posted several times on the debate over natural vs synthetic ingredients and I still recommend that you look for safe, efficacious ingredients and not worry so much about where they come from. But I certainly don’t mean to imply that NO natural ingredients work. In fact, I just read a report in the International Journal of Cosmetic Science ( 29 , 219-238) that says avocado sugars are highly beneficial for skin. A research team from Laboratoires Expanscience (that’s French, not a typo) have found that certain sugars found in avocados, like D-manno-heptulose, can improve the structure of the epidermis by boosting collagen. They can also provide a protective antimicrobial barrier. This doesn’t mean you should smear fresh avocado on your skin. The sugars need to be deposited from the right kind of vehicle and they need to be left on the skin to work. While there are plenty of products with avocado oil on the market ( Avo-med even has a line of pet care products with avocado,) we’re not aware of any products that use this sugar technology. If any of you Beauty Brainiacs out there find any, let me know and I’ll review them. So there you have it – a fruit sugar that’s scientifically proven to help your skin. If you’re looking for natural ingredients, it doesn’t get much better than that.","The latest breatkthrough in skin care – from the produce department","e1f9e80257ce785f35a2b7886544f777ca89ba42","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2007/07/the-latest-breatkthrough-in-skin-care-from-the-produce-department/"

Is this product really good for my skin? The Left Brain responds: The product that Julie is referring to is the Nestlé’s “Nescafe Body 3-in-1 Coffee with Collagen.” According to what I read it is sold only in Singapore but Nestle has experimented previously with similar products in Japan. This is one of several new Nescafe products that promote “beauty from within.” But does it really work? Collagen quandary On one hand, there does appear to be some science behind this. According to at least one study ( Biosci Biotechnol Biochem. 2009 Apr 23;73(4):930-2. Epub 2009 Apr 7.) daily ingestion of collagen peptide can help control UV-B induced skin damage and photoaging. In this particular study , subjects ingested 0.2 g of collagen peptide per kilogram of body mass per day. That’s approximately 11 grams of collagen per day for a 125 pound woman. On the other hand, coffee doesn’t appear to be an effective way to administer that much collagen. The Nescafe product contains about 200 mg (or .2 grams) per cup, so you’d need to drink about 55 cups of coffee every day to achieve the benefits that the collagen study identified. (You’d also need to drink 26 glasses of wine to calm down from all that caffeine!) The Beauty Brains bottom line Based on a quick review of a single study, there does appear to be a possibility that ingesting enough of the right kind of collagen may be beneficial for your skin. But don’t fall for the marketing hype of collagen coffee.","Is collagen in coffee good for my skin?","1a6b5f937b1e105bbb2e3b74185445971a51bb4c","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2010/02/is-collagen-in-coffee-good-for-my-skin/"
"The Beauty Brains","","What You Need to Know About Dark Under Eye Circles by The Beauty Brains Heather Needs Help: Hello! I am wondering what you think is the best natural solution for the dark circles under eyes. Do products like Hylexin really work? The Right Brain Responds: You’re in luck, Heather. To help answer your question, we’ve recruited a special Guest Blogger: Dr. Michael Breus, PhD, author of the book “Good Night: The Sleep Doctor’s 4-Week Program to Better Sleep and Better Health.” His book deals with beauty-related sleep issues and here`s what he had to say about your question: What Causes Dark Under Eye Circles Dark rings around the eyes – “raccoon eyes” – are a hallmark sign of poor sleep. The eyelid skin is the thinnest skin found anywhere in the body, so thin that it’s almost transparent. The darkness under the eye is really circulating blood in the soft tissues beneath the skin. Because lack of sleep affects blood circulation, it’s been theorized that sleep loss causes blood to pool under your eyes, giving you those dreaded dark circles. Sleep Loss = decreased circulating blood in soft tissues + Delicate skin around eyes = increased dark undereye circles. The good news is that you can reverse this abnormal circulation by getting the right amount of sleep.” Thanks to Dr. Breus for the background information. If you want to learn more, you can check out his websites at Theinsomniablog and Soundsleepsolutions. So the good news is, a good night’s sleep will help. But are there any cosmetic products that can help fight raccoon eyes? Nothing has been proven very effective, but there are three different approaches you can try: Useful Links… If you have been battling dark circles under eyes for most of your life, then you must try Hydroderm Eye Serum . It helps to get rid of dark circles and eye puffiness. To guarantee your satisfaction, you can try Hydroderm Eye Serum trial offer. Plus I will let you know a secret tip on how you can save 60% off shipping. Click here for more information about Hydroderm . 3 Ways To Treat Dark Under Eye Circles 1) We don’t strongly recommend it, because we haven’t seen any data that clearly shows that it works, but you can try a Vitamin K cream, like Vita-K . T he American Academy of Dermatologists have said that Vitamin K works on the kind of blood pooling that causes facial bruises . This is very similar to the circulation problem that causes under eye circles. So at least there’s a scientific reason why it might work. 2) Some eye wrinkle creams, like Hydroderm Eye Serum, can provide a temporary tightening and smoothing effect that MAY help minimize the appearance of dark circles. 3) Finally, you can always cover up what you can’t clear up by using a tinted foundation to hide the dark areas.

"The Beauty Brains","2018-01-21 21:46:00","Is snake oil good for your skin? by The Beauty Brains Maggie hisses this question: My teacher says that beauty products are really just snake oil. Does that mean they’re poisonous? The Left Brain slithers a response: Actually, Maggie, the term “snake oil” is usually used to imply that a product is fake or ineffective. Real snake oil, according to Wikipedia , comes from China, where “it is used as a remedy for inflammation and pain in rheumatoid arthritis and other similar conditions. Snake oil is still used as a pain reliever in China. Fats and oils from snakes are higher in eicosapentaenoic acid than other sources, so snake oil was actually a plausible remedy for joint pain as these are thought to have inflammation-reducing properties.” After Chinese rail-road workers introduced snake oil to Westerners in the 1800’s, “The snake oil peddler became a stock character in Western movies: a traveling “doctor” with dubious credentials, selling some medicine (such as snake oil) with boisterous marketing hype, often supported by pseudo-scientific evidence, typically bogus.” Given the history of the ingredient, it’s not surprising that Haiying Cosmetics in China markets Seabion Whitening and Moisturizing Lotion with, you guessed it, Snake Oil extract. There’s no mention of joint pain, but the product supposedly replenishes moisture and nutrients, promotes skin metabolism and prevents damage from cold weather. But let’s face it, almost any decent skin lotion will do all those things. Despite the “natural” angle, I’m guessing Snake Oil products wouldn’t sell very well here in the States.

"The Beauty Brains","2017-05-10 09:59:00","What does your hair really need? by The Beauty Brains Cubelixa’s question…Ok, thanks to you I have already learned that silicones are not as bad as some people say; that the first 5 key ingredients of shampoo and conditioner of different brands are often the same or at least similar; and that the herbal stuff they throw into their products don’t do much for my hair but are mostly there for selling/marketing reasons. Now my question is: what (ingredients) does my hair really need to stay healthy and grow as long as I want it to? The Left Brain’s answer: The truth is your hair doesn’t “need” any topical ingredient to keep it “healthy” and growing long. No such thing as healthy hair It’s a common misconception that hair can be healthy. Hair can be no more healthy than a shoe lace, a cotton blouse, or any other non-living fiber. The hair on your head is not living tissue. It is dead, keratinized protein. Hair cannot be healthy. Of course, it can look healthy or not-healthy but that’s not the same thing. What does hair need? So, hair doesn’t need any topical treatment. However, hair follicles (the living tissue below your scalp that makes hair) do need vitamins, nutrients, and other critical elements that it gets from the foods you eat. This is why it is important to eat a healthy diet to have healthy looking hair. One other factor Although there is no ingredient you can put on your hair to make it healthier or improve growth, the particular hair style you wear can have an effect on growth. If you wear pony tails, do a lot of heat styling, or otherwise physically damage your hair, it will negatively affect hair growth.

"Perry Romanowski","","How honey helps hair by Perry Romanowski Ally asks: I have heard that honey will make your hair shiny and add moisture. And that it is a good alternative to ‘cones in conditioners. Does it really moisturize? The Right Brain responds: Ally, we’ve blogged before about the beneficial antibacterial properties of honey for your skin. But what about honey for hair? Good question! Honey honey Honey is a humectant, which means that it holds on to water molecules. This is a desirable property in a moisturizer, especially for skin. But unlike skin, hair is not alive and it doesn’t need as much moisture. What it does need is something to smooth the cuticle so the hair feels soft and looks shiny. Sugar sugar Unfortunately honey is not a good lubricant, so it doesn’t make hair slippery and smooth. In fact, it’s the opposite of slippery– it’s sticky because it’s basically a sugary solution. (Rub some between your fingers and you’ll see!) So it will not smooth your cuticles or help a comb pass through your hair without damaging it. So any moisture-grabbing benefits that honey might give your hair are off set by it’s stickiness. The Beauty Brains bottom line: There are plenty of honey based hair care products on the market but we’ve never seen any that use honey at effective levels for moisturization. Silicones are better for that purpose, even though people think ‘cones are bad for hair. What do YOU think? Is honey an effective natural shine agent or just more marketing hype?","How honey helps hair","78bf7d0eec626051e9ef9da4be06f34d0db5ad09","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2009/04/how-honey-helps-hair/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Does silicone suffocate hair? by The Beauty Brains Carly’s Question: There has been a lot of controversy lately about silicones in hair products. I am a member of a naturally curly hair website and many of the members are anti-silicone because of the claims that silicones bond to the hair and do not allow moisture into the hair shaft. Supposedly once the silicone is on the hair it acts as a barrier between your hair shaft and any moisture. Is all of this true, or is it just a myth? I will sometimes use a silicone product, but then later feel guilty that I am suffocating my hair, and wash it all off. I think it would be great if you can let everyone know the truth behind silicones. The Right Brain’s Response: Questions about silicones being bad for your hair come up a lot. But you can just call us the cosmetic mythbusters, Carly, because silicones do not really cause the problem you described. Shampoos and conditioners that contain a high level of high molecular weight, water insoluble silicones can build up on hair, that much is true. And if you over-use products like this everyday, it is possible to end up with hair that feels weighed down and limp. But even this does happen, you’re not really suffocating your hair. 3 Reasons Why Silicone Can’t Suffocate Hair: 1) Even if you didn’t wash all the silicone out, we’ve never seen any data that indicates that a small amount of silicone residue acts as a “barrier” between hair shaft and moisture. On average, your hair contains about 8 to 14% water by weight but it will equilibrate to the ambient humidity. In other words, it will pick up moisture when it’s very humid and it will lose moisture when it’s very dry. Slight silicone residue won’t substantially change that. Now, if you slather on a heavy layer of a silicone hair treatment product , that’s a different story! 2) Even though your hair absorbs moisture from the environment, its state of dryness isn’t completely controlled by this external water. Dryness is more a function of how damaged your hair is and how much natural lipids it contains. 3) Even if you did block your hair from absorbing moisture, the silicone would act like a moisturizing agent because it would plasticize and lubricate your hair. It would essentially fight the effects of dryness. The Beauty Brains Bottom Line: If you use a silicone containing product and you like the way it makes your hair look and feel, DONT WORRY ABOUT IT! Don’t feel guilty because some people tell you that it’s bad for your hair. Oil products like Ojon can work too if you don’t want to use silicone.","Does silicone suffocate hair?","80d02427ce1b0c4660f6642fae143e16a409049b","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2007/02/does-silicone-suffocate-hair/"

Should I be worried about age spots on the top of my hands and feet from the UV light?

(That’s the UVA range from about 320 nm to 400 nm for those of you keeping score at home.) Nail dryers won’t cause sunburn Fortunately, the danger seems pretty slight because drying lamps have a very low power output, only around 10 watts. Compare that to the power of a full sized tanning bed that can put out up to 2400 watts! So your fingers probably aren’t in much danger. Still, if you’re concerned you could apply some sunblock before using the lamp. (Are any of you nail salon owners out there listening? That would be a great way to plus up your service for your customers. Offer them a little sunscreen to moisturize and protect the skin of their fingers while the nail lamp is doing its drying duty.) But they can still be dangerous So is there ANY danger associated with using UV drying lamps? Yes, in fact, you might be in danger of getting ripped off! That’s because UV light only works on special, more expensive, topcoats that contain a certain type of acrylic polymer that is cross linked by the light. Some salons try to save money by using a regular top coat before using the drying lamp. The UV light won’t do anything to make that kind of polish dry faster.

"Perry Romanowski","","Why does foundation make my face photograph white? by Perry Romanowski Karina’s question… Could you please tell me what the ingredient is in foundation that makes your face look much whiter in photos?!?! Is it just one ingredient, or a combination? Could you recommend any brands which don’t do this? Thanks. The Right Brain’s response: Karina, we’ve never heard of this problem before but we can make an educated guess about what’s happening. Flashback from sunblock One common ingredient in foundations is titanium dioxide. It’s very opaque and so it’s good at concealing skin flaws. But it’s also good at scattering light rays. In fact, it’s used as a sunblock for this very reason. (For example, Neutrogena Healthy Skin Liquid Make up contains 2% titanium dioxide.) So, our guess is that the brand you’re using has more titanium dioxide that’s reflecting a lot of white light which shows up in your photographs. Of course, it’s also possible that talc or one of the other white powders in the formula could be causing the problem too. There’s no way to be sure without testing. The Beauty Brain’s bottom line: If our guess is right you could try looking for foundations that do NOT have titanium dioxide on the ingredient list. We can’t recommend any specific brands, but you can check the ingredients on Drugstore.com . Has your foundation ever made your face look too white?

The Left Brain responds: Celeste, I’ve blogged about using silicones on hair before but I hope I haven’t give you the impression that everything you’ve heard about them elsewhere is not true. Silicones have advantages and disadvantages and you have to decide if they are right for your hair. Now, on to your questions: “Do I have to cleanse the silicone from my hair, or will it wear off?” That depends on what type of silicone you’re talking about. Dimethicone needs to be washed off. Cyclomethicone will evaporate off your hair just like water evaporates. Generally, any shampoo will wash away the silicone left on your hair from styling treatments and conditioners. “Can I use an Aubrey or some such shampoo or cowash?” Any shampoo will wash away the silicone. (Although in general a non-conditoning shampoo will do a better job.) Cowashing (cleaning your hair with conditioner) will not be enough and the silicone may start to build up and weigh down your hair.

So whether you use OPI , Sally Hansen , or any other brand, it makes sense to ask what top coat the nail technician is using so you can make sure you’re getting what you pay for!","Don’t get ripped off by your nail salon","1ab6d5aa15cb38b2ead115d844a49dce74eaf456","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2007/07/dont-get-ripped-off-by-your-nail-salon/"
"Randy Schueller","2015-06-17 10:09:00","Bag Balm: what does it do for skin? by Randy Schueller Lydia’s lost… Ok, I know that I spend way too much time shopping online when I have this fact stuck in my head: Bag Balm is the #3 best selling beauty product on Amazon.com. What’s up with that?!? What’s in this stuff, what does it do, and do I need to buy some? The Left Brain’s leading reply: Bag Balm reminds me of “ Mane ‘n Tail :” They are both products designed for animals that humans have adopted for their own use. That’s right, Bag Balm is actually a product intended to treat skin condition of animals. Bombastic about Bag Balm According to the website for Dairy Association Company, Inc, the company that makes Bag Balm, it’s been used since 1899 to keep cows from becoming chapped. I assume this means it’s used to moisturize and protect the sensitive skin of the udders. For more background on the history of Bag Balm read this USA Today article . Just for the record, the website makes no mention of use on humans, which is not surprising since the product contains a drug active that is not approved for over the counter use on people. Bag Balm ingredients Since this isn’t a typical cosmetic product it doesn’t have to follow the labeling rules for cosmetics and therefore the package doesn’t have to carry a complete list of ingredients. But according to Drugstore.com I see that it contains 8-Hydroxyquinoline Sulfate at 0.3% in a petrolatum and lanolin base. Petrolatum and lanolin are both common skin care ingredients and are also used in heavy duty ointments and wound care products. The real star of the show is the 8-Hydroxyquinoline Sulfate. According to several sources such as this one , this compound is a bacteriostatic and fungistatic agent and it’s used to prepare antiseptics, deodorants, antiperspirants, and fungicides. (Personally, I’ve never seen this used in any products for humans.) The Beauty Brains bottom line I see Bag Balm as a product that combines excellent moisturizing ingredients with a drug active that has antiseptic properties. However, since the active agent is not approved for use on people, the company can not legally make claims in this regard. You may see benefits from using it but legally the company can only promote it for use on animals. What do YOU think? Have you ever used Bag Balm or Mane ‘n Tail?

"The Beauty Brains","","Is Ginvera Green Tea Marvel Gel Marvelous? by The Beauty Brains Christina’s question: Any comments please on Ginvera Green Tea Marvel Gel? The Right Brain’s cup of tea: Before I can comment I have to answer this question: what IS Ginvera Green Tea Marvel Gel? Very Ginvera Ginvera Marketing Enterprise is a Kuala Lumpur based company that markets over 90 beauty care products in Malaysia and other parts of the Far East. Their Green Tea Marvel Gel was introduced in 1985 and is a popular blackhead treatment in that part of the world. The product appears to be a fairly straightforward alpha hydroxy acid treatment thickened with acrylic acid polymers (Carbomer.) Here are the ingredients: Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea) Extract, Ginseng (Panax Ginseng) Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Powder, Germanium Velvet Deerhorn Extract, Lycium Extract, Angelica Archangelicae Extract, Carbomer, Alpha Hydroxy Acids, Methyl Paraben, Menthol, Cyclomethicone (and) Dimethicone, Fragrance, Delonised Water. Marvelous marketing Now for my comment – this product makes ridiculous claims. Here are two examples from Ginvera’s website : 1. Only Ginvera can remove deep layers of dead cells and blackheads. 2. Dermatologists say “blackheads, dead skin are the major cause of skin problems such as enlarged pores, acne, pigmentation, wrinkles, dry rough dull and aging skin.” Come on! This maybe a perfectly fine acne treatment, but there’s no basis for a superiority claim like #1. And as far as #2 is concerned, the last time we checked, dermatologists do NOT attribute bad skin pigmentation and wrinkles to blackheads. Ginvera’s really gone overboard with claims that would not be permissible in mainstream markets like the US or EU. Nonetheless, a number of beauty blogs are raving about this product, so you might try it and find that you like it. But don’t spend a lot of money just because they tell you it’s a marvel. The Beauty Brains bottom line Ginvera Green Tea Marvel Gel, like a zillion other alpha hydroxy acid products, may do a marvelous job of controlling acne. But the company only loses crediblity when it makes outrageous claims like the ones cited above. What’s your favorite acne product?

"Randy Schueller","","Want shiny hair? Avoid the dulling dozen by Randy Schueller Tammy’s turmoil… Can you tell me what makes hair really shiny? Naturally shiny hair has a cuticle that’s smooth and flat; it’s plumped up with water (about 10 to 15% by weight); and it’s rich in natural oils that keep the whole thing “glued” together. Unfortunately, you’re stealing shine from your hair everyday and you probably don’t even realize it. If you want good gloss, you should avoid these 12 things that can rob hair of shine. Or as we like to call them, the Dulling Dozen: 1. Flood Damage Even “harmless” water can be a shine stealer. That’s because too much moisture swells the hair shaft and causes the cuticle to buckle. The more frequently you wet your hair, the less shine you’re likely to have. 2. Shampoo Scrubbing Scrubbing bubbles seem cute but all that rub a dub dub lifts the cuticle even more. Using a conditioning shampoo can help because the hair shafts won’t snag against each other when you’re lathering up. 3. Careless Under-conditioning Ok, not everyone needs to condition EVERY time they wash their hair. BUT, if your hair is dry to begin with it’s much more likely to be damaged during and after styling if you skip conditioner. You’re just giving shine away! 4. Death by Towel Drying So, now your hair is wet. What do you do? Blot, don’t rub! A rough towel can cause an amazing amount of damage on wet hair. 5. The Brush Off Don’t fall for that old myth that you should brush you hair 100 strokes every night. While brushing does temporarily help by distributing natural oils, in the long run it strips off layers of cuticle and weakens hair. 6. Hot Styling Appliances Heat is the natural enemy of shine. That’s because high temperatures damage the natural lipids (fancy word for oils) that help keep hair flexible and shiny. If you do decide to heat style, use protection! 7. Protective Product Residue Yes, you do need to use heat protection but be careful what you wish for. Some leave in creams and gels leave behind a dulling residue. 8. Color My World Chemical coloring is very damaging because it breaks down the inner structure of hair protein. Even if you use the special conditioner that comes with the coloring kit, your hair never fully recovers. 9. Wave Bye Bye Permanent waving is another chemical process that’s highly damaging. 10. Twist and Shout Twisting and playing with your hair is a dangerous habit as far as shine is concerned. That’s because the torsional forces (fancy word for twisting and bending) loosens the cuticles. 11. I Dig A Pony Wearing your hair in a pony tail may seem like a hassle free style, but if you pull it back too tightly you may be creating micro-fractures in the hair that will reflect light unevenly and cause loss of shine. 12. Here Comes The Sun And with the sun comes damaging UV radiation that can wreak havoc on natural hair lipids like 18-methyleicosinoic acid. Without these lipids hair dulls quickly. If you can’t stay out of the sun make sure you’re protecting your hair with a good conditioner.","Want shiny hair?

"The Beauty Brains","","Chemically straightening or flat iron: which is worse? by The Beauty Brains Kim comments… What’s worse: chemically straightening hair, or blowing hair out and flat ironing it 2-3 times per week? I know they’re both bad, but is there a lesser of the two evils? The Right Brain Replies: Chemically straightening is about the worst thing you can do to your hair. That’s because the first step in the hair straightening process breaks apart the protein bonds in hair. Breaking those bonds allows you to take the curl out of the hair but it’s very harmful because not all the bonds are repaired. So, your hair is left much weaker after straightening. Blow drying and ironing are harmful too, but they’re much less damaging than chemical attacks. Plus, you can use heat protection products that will help cut down on the damage. The Beauty Brains bottom line You can iron your hair straight many times before you’ll equal the damage from chemically straightening it one time.","Chemically straightening or flat iron: which is worse?","5ff977c049b6e3bb150fc62c7874ffca84559a85","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2010/02/chemically-straightening-or-flat-iron-which-is-worse/"
"The Beauty Brains","","3 for 1 lotions, astringents, and more by The Beauty Brains Michelle at Vidafrugal asks this three part question: 1. Lotions: if I already wash my face, why do I need lotion? 2. Astringent: they smell like alcohol, could I just rub alcohol on my face to remove impurities? 3. Deodorants: Why are men’s deodorants less expensive than women’s? It makes no sense to me! The Right Brain Responds : Michelle – You ask several good questions. Let’s get right to them! Facial lotion While washing removes oil, dirt, and makeup residue, it can also dry out your skin. That’s because the surfactants, or cleansing agents, in most standard facial washes do strip some of the natural moisturizing oils from your skin. (We’ll have to do a future post to fully explain the difference between good and bad facial washes.) Lotions, on the other hand are designed to put oil and other materials back on your skin to moisturize it. So you may need to use a cleaner AND a lotion, depending on how dry your skin is. Alcoholic astringents The simple answer is yes you can, but you probably shouldn’t. Historically, astringents have been made from alcohol solutions of witch hazel, a natural extract that can make your skin feel tight and firm. For example, consider Olay Daily Care Refreshing Toner . It consists primarily of water, alcohol and witch hazel distillate. But modern astringents have moved away from this approach due to the drying effects of the alcohol. You could also look at Nivea Visage Alcohol-Free Moisturizing Toner – it’s an alcohol free toner that uses glycerin, a castor oil derivative, and a polymer to do give your skin the same kind of refreshed feeling. We’re not saying that one kind of formula is better than the other, we’re just trying to inform you about your choices. You’ll have to experiment to find out which kind of formulation works for you, but hopefully we’ve helped you understand how astringents are different from just using plain alcohol. Deodorants for men and women Even though there maybe some aesthetic differences, the active ingredients are the same regardless of gender. So they really shouldn’t be that much different in price. Let’s chalk that up to the vagaries of marketing!","3 for 1 lotions, astringents, and more","8086619962c69982e300e41985b11940872977b1","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2009/03/3-for-1-lotions-astringents-and-more/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Will copper stop your dandruff? by The Beauty Brains Meg’s brushing up on dandruff: I just bought copper-infused hair brush that supposedly gets rid of dandruff. Will it really work? The Left Brain’s flaky reply: Meg is talking about the Goody “Styling Therapy – Reduce Dandruff – Copper Infused” hairbrush. It claims to be “Infused with copper-plated bristles, this brush: kills 88% of the fungus that causes dandruff and dry, flaky scalp; destroys bacteria and fungus associated with common scalp conditions. Copper is proven to kill the leading cause of dandruff.” I can’t find any credible research to show that a brush made with copper can fight dandruff. But there is a kernel of truth behind their claims. It is well known that metal salts of pyrithione are effective dandruff control agents. Zinc Pyrithione, for example, is widely used in commercial dandruff shampoos. There have been studies (see Nature and Pubmed ) that show copper salts may have some effect, but zinc salts are by far the most effective. If a copper version worked better, trust me, big companies like P&G would find a way to sell that in a product. Even if copper ions are effective, it’s highly unlikely that a copper brush could provide enough scalp contact to deliver any sort of anti-fungal effect. I say you’re much better off using products like Head and Shoulders, Selsin Blue, or Nizoral.","Will copper stop your dandruff?","dde9040d1c3c1569a61e9ae0fb40ef0d6007f136","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2007/07/will-copper-stop-your-dandruff/"
"The Beauty Brains","","What’s the Difference Between Shampoo and Conditioner? by The Beauty Brains Rainbow is curious… I don’t understand, when you apply your shampoo, your hair gets really rough and when you put on conditioner your hair gets really soft. What happened? And also I want to know, is conditioner ACTUALLY being absorbed by your hair? The Left Brain explains: The difference is simple. Shampoos contain cleansing surfactants like SLS, SLES or other detergents. These materials surround oil, lift it off and get rinsed away with the water. Shampoos do not necessarily dry your hair. What they do is remove all the oil (unless you’re using a 2-in-1). This makes the hair feel more dry. Conditioners also contain surfactants, but these are conditioning surfactants. These surfactants have a positive charge on them which makes them “stick” to the damaged, negatively charged proteins on hair. So, when they are rinsed away, things like cetyl alcohol and other ingredients in the conditioner are rinsed away. Conditioners also contain silicones that will stick on hair and are not rinsed away. Conditioners mostly remain on the surface of hair but they do penetrate (absorb) to a small degree.","What’s the Difference Between Shampoo and Conditioner?","d809807eb1dc9308f1a6eb77498bb7dd2f0ac39a","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2010/03/whats-the-difference-between-shampoo-and-conditioner/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Does the Smooth Away Hair Remover Make Hair Less Coarse? by The Beauty Brains Interhawk inquires… I’ve searched the forums and can’t find much information on Smooth Away pads or other similar products. I was wondering if these products actualy worked, and more importantly, if the hair growing back becomes coarser over time as with shaving or if their claims that hair grows back finer are actually true. Sarah Bellum says: I hate shaving so I thought that I’d pick up one of these at my local Walgreens (and I used my own money, no free samples from Smooth Away , I might add!) Here’s what I thought: Smooth Away sucks I used the small pad on my lip and it took a bit too much work for my taste. The end result made me pretty happy vis a vis hair removal but it really stung! I guess I should have known this could be irritating because the directions said to put milk on my skin after using it. Sadly I was unable to comply since I had just used up the last of the cream making myself a White Russian. Too bad, since the stinging sensation made me crave ANY kind of relief! So, given the stinging side effect and the amount of time and effort it took to do the small area of my lip, I doubt I would ever use this on my legs! Will Smooth Away make hair less coarse? According to Smooth Away’s website, FAQ #7, “After continued use, less hair will grow back and it will be thinner than previous hair.” Hmmmm. I’m not convinced. According this post by Lefty and Righty, hair grows back less coarse only if you’ve done something to damage the follicle, like waxing or laser treatment. But shaving, dissolving hair with depilatories, or “sanding” hair with Smooth Away only effects the top of the skin. Why would that make hair grow back less coarse? I’m sure Lefty would say something like…”I would need to see further data involving multiple blind, peer reviewed studies submitted in a hermetically sealed envelope, blah blah blah.” I agree with Lefty’s basic point: when a company makes a claim like this they have to back it up with something more than just “because I said so.” The Beauty Brains bottom line Yeah, I can sand away hair using an abrasive Smooth Away pad, but that doesn’t mean it’s the best way to remove hair. And if I’m gonna put up with painful burning afterwards, I’d better see a MAJOR difference in how the hair grows back.

"The Beauty Brains","","Why Smashbox should be ashamed of O-Glow Blush by The Beauty Brains Tamara’s Intrigued: Smashbox’s O-Glow gel claims to generate a natural blushing effect by stimulating skin circulation. I’m intrigued, but the thought of intentionally inflaming my cheeks with a foreign substance strikes me as a bit weird. Does this really work? The Right Brain Blushes: Let’s take a look, shall we? According to Smashbox: “This revolutionary silicone-based clear gel works on every skin tone and is microcirculating and skin energizing to keep cheeks naturally flushed for hours.” O-Glow does change to a pink color, but not for the reasons Smashbox gives us. We captured our evaluation of this product in the following pictures: Every picture tells a story Picture #1 shows that O-Glow is a clear, colorless gel when it comes out of the tube. In Picture #2 you see that when rubbed on your cheek, it does turn from colorless to a lovely shade of pink. But is a “micro-circulatory effect” really causing the color? Picture #3 has the answer: the product changes color even when it’s applied to a piece of white paper. Since paper doesn’t have blood vessels, it’s obvious that the effect has nothing to do with the circulatory system. How does it really work? So how does it change color? Could it be the Red Dye #27 that’s listed as one of the ingredients? Yep. I’ll spare you the gory chemical details but essentially the red dye is colorless when dissolved in a waterless base. When it comes in contact with moisture, the change in solubility and pH causes the dye to turn bright pink. That moisture can come from your skin, or even just the humidity in the air. So really, this product uses a dye to stain your cheeks just like any other blush. While we appreciate the clever formulation work required to make a color changing product, we say shame on Smashbox for presenting it in such a misleading way. It’s a cool gimmick, but this product does NOT do what they say it does. Considering how they’re blatantly lying to us about this blush, Smashbox should be the ones with the red face!","Why Smashbox should be ashamed of O-Glow Blush","0594fa61b508b5f13d56f343311d3b0d342efaba","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2007/07/why-smashbox-should-be-ashamed-of-o-glow-blush/"

Is this true? The Left Brain replies: Skin so soft is a great moisturizer that gives a smooth, dry feel to skin. That’s because it’s not a lotion – it’s a blend of mineral oil and esters that lubricates without being too wet or greasy. Avon Skin So Soft Bath Oil Ingredients Mineral oil, isopropyl palmitate, dicapryl adipate, fragrance, dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate, BHT (to prevent oxidation) and carrot seed oil ( source ). I think that the most amazing thing about this product is that for decades people have been convinced that it is an excellent mosquito repellent. Rumor had it that Skin So Soft was even better than products with DEET, the most effective active ingredient on the market. In fact so many people were buying SSS for this reason that Avon launched a companion product that contained a non- DEET active. Ineffective insect repellent Unfortunately, this urban legend has been thoroughly debunked by Snopes.com. They reported on a 2002 study that evaluated 17 nationally marketed mosquito products.

"The Beauty Brains","","Does Infusium weaken hair? by The Beauty Brains Berlina beckons… I had recently been using Infusium leave in treatment on my hair and it had been working fabulously. But, my little brother managed to spill the entire bottle on my floor. After thinking of buying another bottle, I bought a replacement conditioner for the time being for the rest of the week. I was wondering what it is in Infusium that works so well with my hair? I heard that it may cause your hair to weaken. Is this true? The Right Brain Responds: Infusium 23 has been around for many, many years (although now it’s owned by P&G) and it’s a very nice leave-in formula. What’s in it that makes it work so well? Let’s take a look at the ingredient list: Water, Amodimethicone, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Panthenol, Cetrimonium Chloride, Dimethicone Copolyol, Polyquaternium-11, Citric Acid, Betaine, Glycerin, Sorbitol, Tricontanyl PVP, PPG-2 Methyl Ether, Serine, Glycine, Glutamic Acid, Arginine, Threonine, Lysine, Alanine, Proline, Hydroxyethylcellulose, PEG-8/SMDI Copolymer, Behenic Acid, Palmitoyl Myristyl Serinate, Oleic Acid, Palmitic Acid, Linoleic Acid, Stearic Acid, Arachidic Acid, PEG-8, Polysorbate 80, Amino Methylpropanol, Fragrance, Sodium PCA, Methylparaben, Methylisothiazolinone, Methylchloroisothiazolinone If we strip this list down to the basic, functional ingredients it looks like this: Amodimethicone, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Cetrimonium Chloride, Dimethicone Copolyol, Polyquaternium-11 Infusium action Of these ingredients, two are really doing most of the work: amodimethicone (which is a water soluble silicone dispersion) and cetrimonium chloride (a very simple but very effective quaternary ammonium compound which sticks to damaged areas of the hair.) Does it weaken hair? No. All conditioners work by smoothing the cuticle and lubricating the hair shaft to protect hair from damage. Infusium does that very nicely without weakening the hair. The Beauty Brains bottom line: If you like leave-in conditioners, you’ll probably like Infusium 23. Make your brother buy you a new bottle and don’t worry about weakening your hair.

"The Beauty Brains","2015-03-27 10:58:00","Is indoor tanning a good source of vitamin D? by The Beauty Brains Katie needs enlightening …I recently saw a billboard advertising that one session of indoor tanning was equal to 100 glasses of milk. Is that really true? Should I ignore all the warnings I hear about indoor tanning and just do it? Could it be that indoor tanning is actually healthy? The Left Brain burns bright: I have to say that I find this whole effort by the indoor tanning industry to be disgusting. Encouraging people to expose themselves to UV radiation to get vitamin D is like telling people to smoke cigarettes to help them lose weight. Both can work, but both are awful ideas. UV and Vitamin D In answer to your first question, Yes, it is true that UV exposure does stimulate your body to naturally produce vitamin D in your skin . It’s the UVB light that does it however, not the UVA. UVB are the rays that also cause sunburning. In indoor tanning booths, the UVB rays are typically reduced to low level to prevent burning. The UVA (tan producing rays) are turned up. Indoor Tanning Industry The indoor tanning industry is taking this fact and using it to claim that exposure to UV is actually good for you. They even go as far to suggest that it’s a myth that UV exposure causes cancer. They post some interesting findings in this report on the “ truth about tanning ” which can be summarized as follows. 1. People are deficient in Vitamin D and that’s causing health problems. 2. UV exposure is the best way to get your dose of Vitamin D. 3. Doctors warning against UV exposure are unscrupulous liars who are getting paid off by the sunscreen industry. 4. Tanning is safe & healthy as long as you don’t burn. 5. Indoor tanning is best because you can control whether you burn or not. Unsupported Conclusions Their conclusions about vitamin D deficiency are supported by recently published studies in peer reviewed science journals. Even the American Academy of Dermatology would agree. However, none of their conclusions after point 1 has any objective support at all. For example, they say UV exposure is the best way to get Vitamin D. The opinion of dermatologists and researchers is that dietary supplementation is a better idea. Who should you believe, the doctors & scientists who study the subject or the tanning industry who is trying to convince you their product is safe? Of course, I’m skeptical of experts, but I’m even more skeptical of sales people. Are Doctors Liars? The implication that dermatologists tell people to avoid UV exposure because they get kickbacks from the sunscreen industry is just ridiculous. Even if there were a few unscrupulous doctors are we really supposed to believe that the sunscreen industry is paying off everyone!? Isn’t it more likely that these people are doing their job by giving advice that they believe will best keep them healthy? As long as you don’t burn The indoor tanning industry prides itself on its campaign to “prevent burning”. They contend that if you don’t burn, you’re getting a healthy dose of UV exposure. Again, researchers dispute this. The fact is that there is a correlation between people who use tanning beds and increased risk of skin cancer . Whether you burn or not does not necessarily matter. Darkside of UV exposure It is true that no one has yet found a direct link between UV exposure and cancer. But according to doctors “the link between ultraviolet exposure from the sun or tanning beds and melanoma is indisputable.” But in addition to the likely cancer risk, there is plenty of evidence that shows UV exposure results in faster aged, leathery-looking skin. Do you really want to risk tanning only to have to worry about wrinkles, age spots, and a leathery complexion? Better is to get your vitamin D from your diet and your tanned look from something containing DHA. The Beauty Brains Bottom Line While the question of the safety of indoor tanning is not cut and dried, it’s pretty clear that the people who are using tanning booths are not motivated to do so to get more vitamin D. According to the opinions of doctors, the safest option for ensuring you get the proper amount of Vitamin D is to get incidental sun exposure plus dietary supplementation. Baking in a booth for vitamins is crazier than a prion-loaded bovine. What do you think of indoor tanning? Should people start doing it to make sure they get enough vitamin D? Leave a comment and let the rest of the Beauty Brains community know.","Is indoor tanning a good source of vitamin D?","9fa481f2c6e3e3c000680481368312f44f4a2c9b","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2009/03/is-indoor-tanning-a-good-source-of-vitamin-d/"
"The Beauty Brains","","How to get rid of hairspray residue by The Beauty Brains Leska Longs To Learn: How do you clean hairspray build up off of a curling iron? The Right Brain replies: How hairspray works Hairsprays (like Sebastian Shaper , Tresemme Tres II , Bumble and Bumble Does It All Styling Spray , and Charles Worthington Big Hair to name a few) work by sticking hair shafts together with tiny droplets of chemical glue, or resins. These resins are polymers that form hard films that weld the hairs together. They’re designed to be water resistant so your hairstyle won’t droop when it’s exposed to high humidity. Unfortunately, that water resistance means that hairspray won’t wash off with water alone. Usually a good shampoo is enough to wash hairspray off your hair. But when you’ve got a LOT of it built up on a styling tool (like your curling iron) or on your bathroom counter, soap and water might not do the trick. When that happens you might have to go for the strong stuff. How to clean hairspray off hard surfaces Since resins are primarily soluble in solvents like alcohol or acetone a little rubbing alcohol (aka isopropyl alcohol) will work pretty well. Or, if you can get ethanol, that will work too. You could also try nail polish remover (which contains solvents like acetone or ethyl acetate) but those are a bit more aggressive. (Which reminds me – before using a solvent on your curling iron, you should check the manufacturers’ directions, because there is a chance the solvent could damage the paint.) How to not blow yourself up Of course, make sure the device is unplugged when you clean it AND that you dry it completely before plugging it back in. High temperatures + electricity + flammable liquid = trouble. (Sometime ask the Left Brain to tell you the story about having a quick cigarette while using hairspray. Trust me, it wasn’t pretty!) Got all that? Good! Now, if you promise not to sue us when your curling iron explodes, we’ll tell you how aerosol hairsprays are made.","How to get rid of hairspray residue","2c1802e0bf0560f54c6db72bf35665167af75153","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2007/07/how-to-get-rid-of-hairspray-residue/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Is Olay Pro-X as good as a dermatologist? by The Beauty Brains Modistmoz asks… I’ve just begun looking into starting an anti aging regiment for my skin (I am 30 with very fair skin). I’m working hard to research products to find the best fit. I was wondering what the Beauty Brains has to say about the new Oil of Olay Professional Pro-X line. Is it any good? The Right Brain replies: Is Pro-X any good? According to one study, it’s as good as prescription anti-aging from a dermatologist. Maybe. Doubtful data? According to Cosmeticsdesign testing done by Procter Gamble, makers of Olay, shows that its Pro-X line performs as well as a tretinoin-based prescription treatment. (Tretinoin is also known as Retin-A.) Now, we can guess what you’re thinking: Yeah, but it’s P&G’s test that shows that it works! Can we trust them? The answer is yes, if the study was designed and executed properly. The real question is exactly what was the test designed to prove? Test data can be used to support many different conclusions depending on the study design. X-rated action In this case, P&G had expert graders look at pictures of the panelists after treatment with both product regimines and rate the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. After 6 months the graders rated both products as performing similarly. But since the Pro-X treatment regimen is moisturizing while the tretinoin treatment tends to be irritating, the tretinoin dosage started low and was ramped up over time. One could argue that this methodology gave the Pro-X product a head start in the treatment, but P&G points out that this application process is consistent with how people actually use tretinoin in real life to help reduce irritation. So, their conclusion is that “prescription efficacy for improving fine lines can be achieved with a cosmetics regimen as well as being better tolerated by patients.” The Beauty Brains bottom line If you like the way tretinoin makes your skin look but you find it irritating, you might have better luck with the Olay Pro-X line. But don’t expect miracles. What do YOU think? Have you had luck with any wrinkle fighting anti-aging skin treatments?

"The Beauty Brains","","What kind of dog shampoos are best? by The Beauty Brains Rouge Design’s doggy style question… I am new here and have really enjoyed all the great info on products for myself. Then I got to thinking about my baby boy. That is, my Mini Schnauzer. I’m wondering if you know anything about dog shampoo ingredients and what would be safe for their skin? The Right Brain’s response: Hi Rouge, and welcome to the Beauty Brains! We specialize in beauty science, not puppy pulchritude, but we’ll do our best to answer your question. We looked at dog shampoos and one of the first things we found out surprised us: Several salon hair care brands now make pet products! Designer dog shampoos That’s right. We found 3 different designer hair care companies who are now catering to pets. Who knows how many more are lurking in the wings? Here are some examples: Kiehls Cuddly Coat Grooming Shampoo Yes that’s right. Kiehls is not just for people anymore! They have a line of pet products including this shampoo. And according to their website, here are the ingredients: Water, Disodium cocodiamphoacetate, Decyl Glucoside, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Lauramidopropyl Betaine, Bishydroxyethyl Dihydroxypropyl Stearamonium chloride, Cocamide MIPA, Glycerine, Fragrance, Sodium Hydroxymethylglycinate, Disodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Chamoomile Extract John Paul Pet Super Bright Shampoo Not to be outdone by Kiehls, stylist Paul Mitchell enters the fray with his John Paul Pet line. These products don’t list any ingredients, but they do proudly proclaim that they’re “tested on humans first.” First? And then what happens? Pet Head Dirty Talk Deodorizing Shampoo Bed Head has always been an edgy brand and they’ve carried that playful tone into their new Pet Head line. Sure, Pet Head is a is a clever play on words but what’s up with the saucy “Dirty Talk” name? Is this a dog shampoo or date night for Sarah Bellum? (Again, no mention of ingredients.) Sulfate free dog shampoos Despite their designer origins, none of these brands appear to be sulfate free. So let’s get back to Rouge’s original question about ingredients. As she pointed out in our Forum , you should only bathe your dog every month (or less) so you don’t dry out their skin. We’ve blogged before that sulfates are cheap, effective cleansing ingredients but they can be too drying for some skin types. In low concentrations, with infrequent usage, it’s unlikely that they would cause any problem for your pet. But, if you’re worried about using sodium laureth sulfate (SLES) shampoos on your pet’s delicate skin, then you need to find products that list the ingredients so you can look for non-sulfate formulas. You should look for the same kinds of ingredients used in baby shampoos like decyl glucoside. Here are a few examples of sulfate free dog shampoos you might want to consider. Not Soap, Radio Say It With Suds You’re the Best Dog Herbal Shampoo Ingredients: Aqua (distilled water), Sodium Olefin Sulfonate (plant source), Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Juice, Cocamidoproply Betaine (plant source), Sodium Chloride Sea Salt, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Apple (Pyrus Malus) cider vinegar, Potassium Sorbate, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Neem (melia azadirachta) leaf extract, Tocopherol (*Vitamin E), Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Oil, Sodium Bicarbionate (Baking Soda), Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender Extract) Oil, Cedrus Atlantica (Cedarwood) Bark Oil, Eucalyptus Globulous Leaf Oil, Cymbopogon Nadus (citonella) oil, Citric Acid (natural pH Adjuster) The olefin sulfonate will not be as mild as regular baby shampoo. Cloud Star Buddy Wash Pet Shampoo, Lavender & Mint Ingredients: Coconut shampoo base, aloe vera gel, essence of lavender, essence of mint, chamomile extract, sage extract, nettles extract, rosemary extract, wheat protein extract (natural deodorizing agent), tea tree oil, vitamin E, vitamin C We’re not sure about this one since it’s hard to tell what the heck coconut shampoo base includes. Since SLES can be made from coconut oil it could be “hidden” in the blend. Nature’s Dog By Canus Fresh Goat’s Milk All Natural Shampoo Bar Ingredients: Sodium Palmate, Sodium Palm Kernealate, Aqua, Glycerin, Caprae Lac (Fresh Goat’s Milk), Parfum, Melia Azadirachta (Neem) Leaf Extract, Juniperus Communis Fruit Extract, Malaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Extract, Sodium Chloride, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Limnanthes Alba (Meadowfoam) Seed Oil, Tetra Sodium Edta. While it’s sulfate free, this soap based cleanser may not be very mild. Four Paws Magic Coat Tearless Shampoo for Dogs and Puppies with Sensitive Skin Ingredients: Water, Triethanolamine, Coamide DEA, PEG-40 Lanolin, Perfume, Quaternium 15, EDTA, Sodium Chloride, FD&C Yellow #5. Ok, this one we’re suspicious of because of misspellings in the ingredient list we found online. Our guess is that it really contains Triethanolamine Lauryl Sulfate which is milder than most sulfates but it still is a sulfate. The Beauty Brains bottom line Unlike people products, pet shampoos don’t have to list ingredients so it’s tricky to tell what each product contains. But based on our experience with people, occasionally using a shampoo that contains SLES is probably not really a problem. Still, if you are concerned, look for dog shampoos that list the ingredients on the label and avoid “sulfates.” Or, you could also use a regular baby shampoo. Or if you have an extra $6000 to spend, you could get the latest gadget for your pet: a shampoo-free automatic dog washer . What do YOU think? Do you have a favorite pet shampoo?

"The Beauty Brains","","Beauty review – new herbal essences shampoo – drama clean and more by The Beauty Brains In case you haven’t seen it yet, Herbal Essences has restaged their popular hair care line. Restage is a bit of an understatement – it’s more like they’ve completely revamped the brand with new packaging, color, and fragrances. But what about the formulas? Are the new Herbal Essences products really different than the old ones? For starters let’s take a peak at their shampoos, shall we? As a reference, take a look at the ingredients in the “old” Herbal Essences shampoo: “Old” Normal shampoo: Water, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Chloride, Citric Acid, Sodium Citrate, Fragrance, Passiflora Incarnata Flower Extract, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Flower Extract, PEG-60 Almond Glycerides, Cocamide MEA, Sodium Benzoate, Tetrasodium EDTA, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Linoleamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride Phosphate, Sodium Xylene Sulfonate, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Yellow 5, Orange 4, Ext Violet 2 There’s too much information here, so let’s boil this formula down to the active ingredients – the ones that actually do something to you hair that you can feel. That means we’ll eliminate botanical extracts that don’t do anything, fragrance which smells good but doesn’t do anything, preservatives , etc etc. Now it looks like this: Cleansing Ingredients Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine Conditioning ingredients PEG-60 Almond Glycerides, Cocamide MEA, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Linoleamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride Phosphate Now, let’s look at the new versions in the same way. Three of the shampoos are essentially the same: Drama Clean – refreshing shampoo Cleansing Ingredients Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Cocamide MEA Conditoning Ingredients Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Linoleamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride Phosphate Color Me Happy – for Color treated Hair Cleansing Ingredients Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Cocamide MEA Conditoning Ingredients Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Linoleamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride Phosphate Totally Twisted – curls and waves shampoo Cleansing Ingredients Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Cocamide MEA Conditoning Ingredients Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Linoleamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride Phosphate All three of these shampoos are the same except for the removal of the PEG-60 Almond Glycerides, which doesn’t add much conditioning anyway. Of course they changed the extracts, color and fragrance too but the products will all perform about the same. If you want to know more about curling shampoos, read our previous post . Here’s another one that’s just a little bit different: Degunkify – tingling deep cleaning shampoo Cleansing Ingredients Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Cocamide MEA Conditoning Ingredients None Since this is a deep cleaning product, they took out the conditioning ingredients. Plus they threw in some menthol for a scalp tingling effect. Otherwise it’s the same. This next one is a little different: Body Envy – volumizing shampoo Cleansing Ingredients Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, PPG-2 hydroxyethyl coco/isostearamide Conditioning ingredients Polyquaternium-10 The foam on this one will feel a little different and there’s less conditioning. Makes sense for the volume product. Now let’s look at the last three: Dangerously Straight – pin straight shampoo Cleansing Ingredients Ammonium Lauryl Sulfate, Ammonium Laureth Sulfate, Cocamide MEA Conditioning Ingredients Cetyl Alcohol, Dimethicone, Glycol Distearate, Polyquaternium-10 Hello Hydration moisturizing shampoo: Cleansing Ingredients Ammonium Lauryl Sulfate, Ammonium Laureth Sulfate, Cocamide MEA Conditioning Ingredients Cetyl Alcohol, Dimethicone, Glycol Distearate, Polyquaternium-10 Break’s Over – strenghthening shampoo : Cleansing Ingredients Ammonium Lauryl Sulfate, Ammonium Laureth Sulfate, Cocamide MEA, Conditioning Ingredients Cetyl Alcohol, Dimethicone, Glycol Distearate, Polyquaternium-10 (plust they Plus they threw in some pearl powder and a suspending agent to give it a sparkly appearance but it doesn’t really make it perform any differently.) These are all conditioning shampoos, very much different than the others. And very different than the old Herbal Essences. But these shampoos are very similar to another product, Pantene’s Smooth and Sleek! Pantene Smooth and Sleek: Cleansing Ingredients Ammonium Laureth Sulfate, Ammonium Lauryl Sulfate, Cocamide MEA Conditioning Ingredients Glycol Distearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Dimethicone, This similarity is not surprising, in fact, we’d expect it because Herbal Essences and Pantene are both owned by P&G . It’s very common for large companies to use their best formula technology across several brands. The Beauty Brains Bottom Line: Herbal Essences has done an interesting job of restaging their brand but they didn’t make any revolutionary changes to their shampoo formulas. What does this mean? If you liked the the way the old Herbal Essences shampoo worked and you like the new fragrances, then you will like this new product just fine. But if you didn’t like the way it left your hair feeling before, then don’t expect this new version to do anything different. But even if you don’t like the way the products work you should take a look at them on the shelves, the labels are interesting to read and the fragrances are fun to smell. Leave a comment and let us know if you want us to review the conditioners and styling products too.

"The Beauty Brains","","Is Baby shampoo bad for your hair? by The Beauty Brains Kitten Devine’s question… Yesterday at a hair shop they asked me what shampoo I used. So I told them I use Zwitsal baby shampoo, because I like how it makes my hair feel and because sodium laureth sulphate is only the 5th ingredient on the list, so I figured it’s more gentle and doesn’t strip the color out of my hair. Now they told me that baby shampoo was bad for your hair because the pH of it is different then regular shampoos. Because of the different pH it would open your cuticles whereas ‘good’ (more acidic) shampoos would close them. Is this true or myth? The Left Brain’s reply: As Purple Rules pointed out in our Forum , the pH of baby shampoos has nothing to do with it’s performance. Shampoos are formulated over a pH range from about 5.0 to 7.0. Most people’s water has a pH around 6.5 to 7.0. No matter what shampoo you use, once it’s on your head mixed with water, the pH will be about the same as the water. The people at your hair shop are mistaken. What do YOU think? Has your stylist ever told you to change shampoos because of the pH? Leave a comment and share your thoughts about this myth with the rest of the Beauty Brains community.","Is Baby shampoo bad for your hair?","bc328ee8c46401a84957930a2de1e41e8b880089","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2010/03/is-baby-shampoo-bad-for-your-hair/"

"The Beauty Brains","None","Sulfates in shampoos: What are they? by The Beauty Brains Ambarian asks… What exactly are Sodium Laureth Sulphate , Sodium Lauryl Sulphate, Ammonium Lareth Sulphate and Myreth Sulphate . What is their main purposes in a shampoo? Is it true if you buy a shampoo that contains ALS it is not as harsh on you hair . Is it true that these will strip hair of natural oil and moisture hence if you have dry / curly hair it is best not to use shampoo containing these? The Left Brain responds… We’ve talked about Sulfates in your shampoo before and we encourage you to read this first. In the industry, these compounds are known by acronyms such as SLS, SLES, ALS, etc. While we cosmetic chemists like to say really long words to describe chemicals, they can hamper conversations. These sulfates are all primary detergents that make shampoos, body washes and other cleansers clean and foam. Without these ingredients cleansing products wouldn’t work nearly as well as they do. Practically speaking, ALS is just as harsh on your hair as SLS. ALS is the main detergent of brans like Pantene, Herbalessences, Dove and Suave. SLS is used in Paul Mitchell, VO5 and lots of other brands. Of the ones you listed Myreth sulphate would be least harsh (although it is still more harsh than the things you’d find in a baby shampoo). These ingredients will not strip your hair of oil any worse than other surfactant bases. All shampoos strip your hair of natural oil. That’s how they clean. In this regard, avoiding these ingredients will not be helpful to you. Some people find these surfactants a bit more irritating than others so you might take this into consideration when buying a product with them in it. If you have dry/curly hair than you can use any shampoo but make sure you use a conditioner afterwards. This will help replenish the oils that are lost. If you are concerned about stripping natural oils, the only thing you can do is stop washing your hair. But remember the natural oils help capture dirt, dust and pollution that you walk through every day. For clean hair you really don’t want natural oils. Beauty Brains bottom line Sulfates are used in many personal care products and are some of the most effective ingredients you can use for cleaning. They often get bad press and the Natural crowd hates them, but they are perfectly fine ingredients. They’re what all of the Beauty Brains use.","Sulfates in shampoos: What are they?","73be49d2d1afe406c62da243a811261cc96fc21f","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2007/06/sulfates-in-shampoos-what-are-they/"
"The Beauty Brains","2015-03-09 16:47:00","Do sunscreen pills work? by The Beauty Brains LoonyLolipop asks… Many news articles are gushing about the revolutionary development of sunscreen supplements, specifically SunPill and Heliocare. These products would be a wonderful alternative to topical sunscreens because I am very allergic to oxybenzone and avenobenzene, two common ingredients in over-the-counter topical sun blocks. However, no article has mentioned whether this pill offers broad spectrum protection. It seems like I can get more effective and less expensive sun protection by wearing a hat and drinking green tea. I admit that I am a cynical person and can be fairly stubborn. Since you have more access and knowledge about scientific breakthroughs, are these sunscreen supplements over-hyped products? Or is there a sizable benefit that warrants the expensive price? Left Brain enlightens… I agree that sunscreen pills would be a great invention. Slathering on sunscreen lotions multiple times a day can be a bit of a pain. Of course, using sunscreen is one of the most important things you can do to prevent skin cancer and keep you skin looking young and healthy. Sunscreen pills There are a few different options for sunscreen pills. These include the following Heliocare – Heliocare contains antioxidants derived from a natural fern (Polypodium leucotomos). These antioxidants are supposed to reduce skin-damaging free radicals which could theoretically have benefits to skin elasticity, reduce sun damage and increase tolerance to the sun. There is some evidence that the natural fern antioxidants taken orally can decrease UV damage . However, the study was pretty small (9 people) so more work needs to be done. Verdict – There is some evidence that Heliocare supplements work. SunPill – Sunpill contains a variety of antioxidants including Polypodium leucotomos extract, Green tea extract, pomegranate, etc. Again, these have some theoretical support but the studies have all been small and should only be considered preliminary. Verdict – There is some evidence SunPills work and they are less expensive than Heliocare. Murad Pomphenol Sunguard – This product contains a high level of pomegranate extract and some studies like this one suggest that it can help inhibit sun damage pigmentation. Verdict – There is some evidence that Murad is somewhat effective. Potential Problems with Sunscreen Pills While there is some evidence that these products can work, there are a couple of problems with them. The first issue with these sunscreen pills is that none of them claim to be a replacement for topically applied sunscreens. So, if you still have to apply sunscreen, what’s the point of taking an expensive supplement? At over $50 for 60 pills one has to wonder if it’s really worth it. The next issue is that it’s unclear how long the product will work. With a topical sunscreen you know approximately how long it will last and when you need to reapply. With these supplements their effectiveness will depend on how your digestive system works. And this will be significantly different from person to person. Perhaps the most significant problem with these products is that they are not regulated by the FDA, so you don’t even know if they contain the ingredients they claim to have.

"The Beauty Brains","","Beauty research: Can cellulite cream help me lose weight? by The Beauty Brains Heidi Has A Question… Can I lose weight by using an anti cellulite cream ? If so, will it work on any fat or just on the parts of the body with cellulite? The Right Brain Responds: Heidi, I’m afraid that anti-cellulite creams are NOT an effective weight loss treatment. In fact, there’s no solid scientific evidence to show that they do much of anything at all. What is cellulite? Despite what you might be told at a spa, cellulite is not some special medical condition. Although its dimpled appearance (seen frequently on thighs and buttocks) is disturbing, cellulite is really just a type of body fat. For that reason, there has been little published in the peer reviewed medical journals. Does anything really work? But what about all the products marketed as cellulite reducers – do they really work? We quote the December, 2004 issue of the Journal of Cosmetic Laser Therapy (6(4):181-5) : “There are no truly effective treatments for cellulite.” That pretty much sums it up, doesn’t it? The FDA certainly seems to thinks so. They’ve stopped a number of companies from making unsupported anti-cellulite claims. These companies include Slender You, Inc., Nature’s Cleanser, Revlon, Inc, Synchronal Corp, Silueta Distributors, Inc., European Body Concepts, and many others. Is there ANYTHING that the FDA has found to be effective against cellulite? Well, we thought you’d never ask. Actually, in 1998 they approved a massage tool used in a process called “Endermologie” for the claim that it “temporarily improves the appearance of cellulite.” But don’t get too excited. Despite FDA’s apparent endorsement, subsequent studies have shown that the treatment has some issues. We quote Quackwatch : “In 1998, the FDA approved a high-powered, handheld massage tool that consists of a treatment head and two motorized rollers with a suction device that compresses the affected tissue between the two rollers. The manufacturer is permitted to promote it for “temporarily improving the appearance of cellulite.” The procedure — called Endermologie — usually takes 10 to 20 treatments to get the best results, and one or two maintenance treatments per month are required to maintain them. Without the maintenance, the benefits will soon be lost. The typical cost is $45 to $65 per session. A recently published study of 85 women between the ages of 21 to 61 found that 46 patients who completed seven sessions showed a mean index reduction in body circumference of 1.34 cm, while 39 patients who completed 14 sessions of treatments showed a mean index reduction in body circumference of 1.83 cm. However, another study, involving 52 women, found no objective difference in thigh girth (at two points) or thigh fat depth (measured by ultrasound).” So in reality, it doesn’t look like Endermologie is a fast way to lose weight either! The Beauty Brain’s Bottom Line You can’t lose weight from anti-cellulite creams. And the Pink Patch doesn’t work either. Stick to diet and exercise. And by the way, for some great tips on those topics, check out Dietblog.com","Beauty research: Can cellulite cream help me lose weight?","2a7e6f2d780aa570c77ad381ad2c148a74dae506","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2009/03/beauty-research-can-cellulite-cream-help-me-lose-weight/"
"The Beauty Brains","2016-08-03 07:02:00","A safe way to make your skin look brighter and younger by The Beauty Brains Margaret and Betty are inquisitive about Definity: Margaret says Definity works great for her but she wants to know if all the products in the line are basically the same; Betty is worried that Definity’s not safe because she heard it contains hydroquinone. The Right Brain provides this definitive response: P&G must be doing a good job of marketing their Olay line because we get a lot of questions about Definity . So, we present a double dose of Definity: In Part 1 we explain how the products work; in Part 2, we’ll talk about how the products in the line are different from one another. What Does Definity Do? According to P&G, Definity “fights what ages you most: discoloration, dullness, brown spots, and fights wrinkles.” The fighting wrinkles stuff is pretty standard in beauty creams. If you’re hydrating the skin (especially if you’re using a film forming agent that helps hide fine lines) you can support anti-wrinkle claims. The interesting aspect of Definity is that it claims to make the skin more luminous because it gets rid of darkness and dullness. How Does Definity Make Skin Luminous? Skin lightening claims like these normally involve hydroquinone, a skin bleaching agent that’s come under fire for safety reasons. Fortunately, Definity doesn’t contain hydroquinone. Instead, it uses N-acetyl glucosamine, chemical that inhibits glycosylation of pro-tyrosinase. (Relax, that just means it prevents the kind of chemical reactions that make liver spots and freckles.) N-acetyl glucosamine (or NAG as it’s known) is not as effective as hydroquinone, but it’s safer to use. Sound too good to be true? Check out the multiple clinical test results that show glucosamine effectively prevents dark age spots . And if dark spots are reduced, skin will look lighter and more luminous. Of course, the question is, how MUCH improvement will you really see. The only way to tell for sure is to try the product. But at least Olay has done their homework and formulated a product line that’s based on science, not snake oil. The Beauty Brains bottom line: Definity does contain an ingredient proven to lighten skin. Of course, that doesn’t guarantee that you’ll notice a difference yourself. It’s a bit expensive at $22 for 1.7 ounces, but at least their claims are based on real science. In Part 2 we’ll talk about the other products in the line and how they differ.","A safe way to make your skin look brighter and younger","189c9897e1974c0becab8d8ab2749a90f71f4680","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2007/06/a-safe-way-to-make-your-skin-look-brighter-and-younger/"
"The Beauty Brains","","What drugstore brand is comparable to arbonne? by The Beauty Brains ibteachnu asks… I can no longer afford Arbonne . What drugstore brands are comparable to their hydrating wash, balancing toner, facial serum, and day creme? I’ve already replaced their RE-9 foaming body wash with Olay’s age defying body wash. What are your thoughts on that product? Right Brain responds After that big battle about Arbonne, we no longer let Left Brain answer questions about Arbonne, so this one is mine. Arbonne Hydrating Wash At almost $40 for a 3 ounce bottle of the Arbonne Hydrating Wash , it’s no wonder you can’t afford Arbonne anymore. No cleanser is worth that expense. Cleansers are put on and then rinsed away. Unless the skin is specially prepared before-hand, cleansers have limited ability to deliver anything to the skin. They simply remove things. Arbonne does make it challenging to find ingredient lists, but with enough Google searching you can usually find them. The basic ingredient list for the Hydrating wash is as follows. Sodium Cocoyl Sulfate, PEG-80 Sorbitan Laurate, Stearic Acid, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Lauroamphoacetate, Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate, Disodium Lauroamphoacetate This isn’t a complete list but it’s enough to get the general gist of the product. Basically, they are using standard but more gentle surfactants. Olay alternative? Oil of Olay is always a good choice. It is made by P&G and is one of the most thoroughly tested skin care lines available. It also has the most cosmetic chemists and scientists behind its development. The ingredients in this particular product are different than the ones found in Arbonne. Here’s the ingredient list. Water, Petrolatum, Ammonium Laureth Sulfate, Sodium Lauroamphoacetate, Ammonium Lauryl Sulfate, Lauric Acid, Fragrance, Trihydroxystearin, Sodium Chloride, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Citric Acid, Niacinamide (Vitamin B3), Butyrospermum (Shea Butter) Extract (Shea Butter), Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Retinyl Palmitate (Vitamin A), DMDM Hydantoin, Sodium Benzoate, Disodium EDTA, PEG 14M ALES & ALS are typically harsh detergents but the harshness is more than off-set by the fact that a moisturizing ingredient (Petrolatum) is the second ingredient. The Petrolatum will protect skin from the harshness of the detergents so overall, the Olay product should be more gentle than the Arbonne product. Closer Drugstore Alternative The Olay product and Arbonne products should behave similarly but if you are looking for something even closer, consider trying some of the following. Johnsons Soothing Naturals Hair and Body Wash – hair and body wash. Contains PEG-80 Sorbitan Laurate as the primary surfactant. Purpose Gentle Cleansing Wash – Contains three of the primary surfactants found in Arbonne Beauty Brains bottom line Everyone has different skin and you need to experiment to figure out which type of cleansing product works best for you. However, there is no need to spend a lot on a cleansing wash. Go to your local drugstore and find a product that will work for you. It will be good for your skin and wallet too.

"The Beauty Brains","","Is thermaclear an effective acne device? by The Beauty Brains Diane declares… I just wonder whether those acne devices are really effective? Are they? Right Brain responds : Some time ago Sarah did a raving review about the Thermaclear anti acne device in which she stated “…it does work, although it’s not 100% effective.” Her skin always looks great, so who really knew whether it was the device or just the luck of her genetic draw. Despite the fact that Thermaclear… 1. Was FDA approved for safety 2. Was FDA approved for effectiveness based on clinical trials 3. People who use it swear it works 4. Is a top seller at Sephora …it is hard to believe this gadget had much effect. After all, if you do nothing to a pimple it goes away right? Acne Device Science This article entitled Evidence for Laser- and Light-Based Treatment of Acne Vulgaris from the September 08 Journal Seminars in Cutaneous Medicine and Surgery ( Left Brain’s idea of light reading) provides some interesting scientific information. From it, the FDA website and some information provided by Thermaclear, we’ve put together these seven facts that will help answer the question. 1. Try Topical Treatments first No comparison studies were done but the article suggests we should try things like benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid first. It seems like they think these will usually be more effective. But Thermaclear is thought to be faster and effective for people who don’t respond to topical treatments. 2. Thermaclear works in three ways Laser/light therapy works to stop acne by killing the bacteria that causes it, reducing sebum production and suppressing the anti-inflammatory skin processes. It does this by sending a blast of a short thermal pulse into the effected area. 3. Clinical studies show effectiveness According to the report, laser/light therapies are effective for treating certain kinds of acne. Although most of the studies had a small number of participants, at least some were randomized, blinded studies. 4. Safer than UV exposure The idea of creating these devices got started because people long thought that sun exposure could reduce acne. Of course, its effectiveness for this purpose was never proven. Certainly, it isn’t a safe option consider the cancer / wrinkle risk. These laser/light devices like Thermaclear turned out to be a better option. 5. FDA approved The FDA has approved dozens of devices like Thermaclear so the fact that it is approved doesn’t mean much. However, it does mean that the company showed government scientists at least some compelling clinical data to support using it to treat acne. 6. Works faster than no treatment This is a claim from the company but it is probably from the clinical studies given to the FDA as proof. Unfortunately, they used a trick common to most cosmetic product makers. In their studies they answered the question “Does this product work?” But they didn’t answer the question that everyone desperately wants to know. Namely, “Does this product work better than other products on the market?” We still don’t know about that. 7. Does not work on all acne One thing Thermaclear makers admit is that the device will not work on all types of acne . If you have blackheads, whiteheads, or serious acne, Thermaclear is not for you. But if you have mild blemishes, you should see results. Beauty Brains Bottom Line Scientific studies show that these acne devices are actually effective. You should try standard creams first but if you’re not having luck, try something like Thermaclear Acne Clearing Device . Have you tried one of these acne devices? Did it work for you?

"The Beauty Brains","2017-04-10 07:00:00","Can yogurt rebalance your skin’s pH? by The Beauty Brains A while back we reported on the trend of using yogurt in your skin products to create better products. Well, the good folks at Givaudan (a large fragrance supplier to the beauty industry) is introducing their own yogurt-based product. This new product called Yogurtene Balance Powder is a spray dried version of yogurt and is supposed to “rebalance the body’s natural pH balance.” Givaudan says that their yogurt will be good for the anti-wrinkle market because it will help retain skin moisture and protect the collagen lattice in skin. Oh yeah, and it’s a great hair conditioner. For some reason I find this stuff cute. It’s homey, it’s natural, it’s yogurt. How can it not be great? Of course, there is no proof that yogurt will provide any benefit to your skin. No, it’s not going to protect the collagen lattice. It might help with skin moisture but not nearly as good as things like mineral oil, fatty alcohols or petrolatum. And no, it won’t re-balance your skin’s pH. Actually, I have no idea what that means. Can anyone enlighten me? I just couldn’t figure out how to get the pH meter to give me a reading on my skin. When will cosmetic companies learn? Food is for eating, not wearing.

"The Beauty Brains","","Who sells the best beauty products? by The Beauty Brains You probably don’t think about the types of companies that make your cosmetics and beauty products but if you did, you might make different choices in the products you buy. Big and Small companies The majority of beauty products you can buy at supermarkets & department stores are made by big companies like P&G, Colgate-Palmolive, L’Oreal, Unilever, etc. If you’re curious, here is a list of the Top 50 Us companies and this list of the Top 30 International companies . But most of the unique beauty products you can buy on the Internet or in specialty shops are produced by small companies, often mom n pop shops started by an enterprising marketer, chemist, or other person interested in the cosmetic business. So, you might wonder, what’s the difference? How are the products different? There are many differences between the products produced by big companies and those made by small ones. Here is a list of 6 key characteristics of a beauty product and how big companies stack up against small ones. Cosmetic Technology Big companies have lots of money to spend on research and development. They hire the most scientists, pay the highest salaries, and consequently get the best people. This doesn’t automatically translate into superior products but it’s a good bet that they will be. Big companies also are given special privileges by raw material suppliers, so they can also get exclusive use of the best technologies available. Small companies usually don’t have much money to develop their products so they end up using generic formulas made by their contract manufacturer. This is the company that actually makes the batches of products for them. When it comes to the technology of your beauty products, small companies have a hard time competing. Product Testing Big companies spend more money on testing their products. There are two main reasons for this. First, they want to protect themselves from lawsuits. If they have testing to back up their claims, it’s much harder to sue. Second, they want to give themselves a competitive advantage over other products. In the beauty biz, it’s difficult to differentiate your product from a competitor. Testing can help reveal differences. Small companies can typically afford to do only the bare minimum of testing required. More testing doesn’t automatically mean better but it certainly doesn’t hurt. Quality Big companies have large staffs of people dedicated to testing the raw materials and finished products of everything they make. Small companies have one or two cosmetic chemists who have to test everything. Safety Big companies are sensitive to lawsuits and will be extra careful to ensure that their products do not cause someone to sue them. They are also more likely to get fined by governments for not complying to regulations so they are ultra cautious. Being cautious is a disadvantage for small companies because it interferes with their ability to come out with unique products. Some also might be more likely to use lower quality raw materials because they can get it for a lower cost. This doesn’t apply to all small companies and most of their products are perfectly safe. Products from big companies are more likely to be safer. Cost The more of a product you buy, the less money it costs. Big companies buy lots of raw materials so they get them for a much lower price. This is why they can charge less for their products. If a small company tries to sell a lower cost product, they will eventually run out of money & go out of business. It is not a good strategy. This doesn’t mean every product from big companies are reasonably priced (P&G tried to sell Physique for $12 a bottle when it didn’t cost more than Pantene to make). But for the most part, lower cost, better value will be found from big companies. Advertising This is where big companies spent the bulk of their money. TV commercials are not cheap. Of course, advertising doesn’t make the products better so this is actually a disadvantage for big companies. However, small companies do advertise, it’s just usually on the Internet. Unfortunately, the Internet is not regulated like mass media so anyone can pretty much claim whatever they like on the Internet. (e.g. the advertising is less believable). You are just more likely to be misled by the advertising of a small company than a big one. Having said that, big companies can also be misleading in their advertising. Uniqueness Big companies formulate products for the maximum number of people they can. This means they won’t come out with special products for special problems. This is where small companies can thrive and shine. They don’t need to satisfy shareholders and have record sales and profits every quarter. They can make a living selling to a small select group of consumers and have a thriving business. If you have a unique problem (e.g. you want gluten free beauty products), you’re more likely to find a solution from a small company. Beauty Brains bottom line So who’s product should you be buying? If you are most concerned with getting the safest, highest quality products with the newest and best-tested technology, you should buy your products from big companies If you are interested in finding unique solutions for your particular beauty problems, aren’t as concerned about cost, and are willing to risk some quality issues, you should look to small companies for your beauty products. Would you rather buy your products from small or big cosmetic companies? Does it matter to you?

"The Beauty Brains","","How do clarifying shampoos work? by The Beauty Brains Noumenon needs to know… How exactly do clarifying shampoos work? Some say that the extra-harsh Lauryl surfactants are what strips the hair of all the build-up, and they are safe to use once in a while for clarifying purposes. However, others say that it has nothing to do with the strength of the surfactant and even Sodium Laureth Sulfate can be used in a clarifying shampoo on it’s own. These people tend to claim that it’s something like lemon peel or an acidifier like citric acid that helps to strip the build-up. Could you please help to “clarify” the situation for us all? What exactly is the specific ingredient(s) that removes build-up beyond my gentle Sodium Laureth Sulfate based shampoo? Or is the whole clarifying thing a myth and you can really use any shampoo you want to remove build-up equally? The Right Brain clears up clarifying: There seems to be a popular misconception that clarifying shampoos work by using acid to remove hard water scale – kind of like “Lime-Away.” WiseGeek and About.com both claim that acetic acid should be a major component in a clarifying shampoo but the Beauty Brains have never seen a shampoo actually formulated that way. Acid washed I can see how this idea got started because it goes along with the notion that using vinegar to rinse your hair closes the cuticle and makes hair shinier. Unfortunately hair biology is not that simple. It’s true that very high pH chemical treatments (like relaxers) swell the hair shaft and lift the cuticle.When you relax your hair, you do need to neutralize the high pH so in that case acid treatment makes sense. But the same principle doesn’t really apply to hair that hasn’t been freshly relaxed or permed. Real cause of build up Hard water residue is not even the most common cause of build up. It’s more likely to be a result of not properly removing styling products. And if that’s the cause, then you certainly don’t want to use a product that contains more acid. That’s because the styling resins used in hairsprays, mousses, and gels become more water soluble when the pH is raised. So to help get rid of styling resin buildup you want to use a product that with a higher pH not lower which us what acid would do. Another possibility is that build up is caused by high molecular weight silicones and other water insoluble oils that deposit on your hair form conditioners or treatments. Neither acid or base will get rid of those bad boys. The real clarifier So what ingredients are really responsible for clarifying? Our old friends surfactants ! A lot of people won’t want to hear this, but the lauryl sulfate type of surfactants are among the safest most powerful cleansers you can buy. As we explained in The Danger of Clarifying Shampoos, some people do complain of dry itchy scalp after using sulfate shampoos especially in dry climates. But most people have no problem, especially if they use them infequently. A typical sulfate shampoo: Tresemme Deep Cleansing Shampoo If sulfates just aren’t your cup of tea, there are plenty of other surfactants to choose from. Non-sulfate anionic cleansers include Sodium Lauryl Sulfoacetate, Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Sodium Lauryl. These tend to be less stripping so you may find they don’t clarify as well. Nonsulfate anionic shampoo: Pureology Serious Colour Care Pure Volume Shampoo Finally you can use an amphoteric shampoo, like a baby shampoo, which primarily contain milder amphoteric surfactants like PEG 80 Sorbitan Laurate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Lauroamphoglycinate. Those generally provide the least cleansing. Amphoteric shampoo: Johnson’s Baby Shampoo Clarifier can’t condition In addition to choosing the correct type of cleansing ingredients it’s very important to choose a clarifying shampoo that doesn’t contain any conditioning agents. You want to make sure that you’re removing gunk from your hair, not depositing more stuff. So avoid any “”cones” like dimethicone, cyclomethicone, or amodimethicone and any conditioning polymers like guar hydroxypropyltrimonium chloride and Polyquaternium 7 and 10. The Beauty Brains bottom line Clarifying shampoos work by washing away the gunk that’s built up on your hair. You don’t need any fancy product to do that – a simple, non-conditioning shampoo will do just fine for most people. What do YOU think? Do you have a favorite deep cleaning shampoo?

"The Beauty Brains","","Four types of wrinkles and how to get rid of them by The Beauty Brains Ellen inquires: Cosmetics companies don’t usually do a good job of explaining the problems they claim to solve. Take anti-wrinkle creams for example. Can someone just please tell me what causes wrinkles in the first place? The Left Brain Educates: Since the goal of the Beauty Brains is to educate our community, we thought we’d share the results of a study published in the International Journal of Cosmetic Science (2006, 28 389-395). Researchers at the University Hospital of Liege, Belgium determined that there actually four distinctly different types of wrinkles that you’ll (eventually) have to face. 1. Atrophic Crinkling Rhytids What they are: Fine lines on the face that are almost parallel to each other. Where they occur: They show up in different areas of the face and body but they tend to disappear when skin is stretched transversally. (that means they shift when your body posture changes.) These wrinkles are associated with loss of elasticity. What you can do: Since these wrinkles are due to underlying loss of collagen, you need to protect your skin using sun protectants. You can also use moisturizers to temporarily plump the skin and diminish the appearance of these fine lines. 2. Permanent Elastic Creases What they are: These are crease lines in the skin that become increasingly permanent over time, especially with sun exposure. Where they occur: They show up most frequently on on the cheek, the upper lip, and the base of the neck. What you can do: Sun exposure makes this type of wrinkle worse. So unless you’re blessed with naturally dark skin, you should avoid sun exposure or use a sunscreen on these areas to prevent this kind of wrinkling. 3. Dynamic Expression Lines What they are: Wrinkles that are caused by facial muscle movement. Where they occur: Frown lines and crows feet. What you can do: These wrinkles respond to Botox or similar treatments. 4. Gravitational Folds What they are: As the name implies, these lines are from the effects of gravity and they become increasingly obvious as skin begins to fold and sag. As we noted in a recent post, skin research on the International Space Station might shed some light on the mechanisms of gravity-induced wrinkles. Where they occur: The location of these wrinkles is related to the thickness of skin. While we would have thought this means that thicker skin shows more folds, surprisingly the researchers said that a fat face may show fewer gravity folds than a lean face. What you can do: Skin-lifting procedures are effective at removing these kinds of wrinkles.","Four types of wrinkles and how to get rid of them","aaad82ae57f15cd3aa56a3a49d1f972e27af637d","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2007/06/four-types-of-wrinkles-and-how-to-get-rid-of-them/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Will Juice Beauty Nourish Your Skin? by The Beauty Brains Saskya ask… Does any one know some about Juice Beauty ? I’m looking for a new mosturizer, but I don’t really know what to buy I don’t want something extremely expensive. The Left Beauty Brain replies If you are looking for a new moisturizer but don’t want to spend a lot of money, then Juice Beauty is not the product for you. Based on the ingredient lists and the marketing story, Juice Beauty products appear to be a bit over-priced for what you get. Of course, this is true of most facial products. Truthfully, a facial moisturizer is not much different than a moisturizer you might use on your hands. Juice Beauty Moisturizer At $36 for 2 ounces of product Juice Beauty moisturizer is only about 50% more expensive than a store brand like Olay or Neutragena. But is it 50% better? To figure this out we need to look at the ingredients and the marketing story. Juice Beauty Ingredients Here is the ingredient list for their nutrient moisturizer. organic juices of vitis vinifera (white grape) juice, daucus carota sativa (carrot) juice & aloe barbadensis leaf juice, organic botanical extracts of calendula officinalis flower, matricaria chamomilla flower, tilia europea (linden) leaf & rose canina (rosehip) fruit, glycerin , organic plant oils of butyrospermum parkii (shea butter) & simmondsia chinensis (jojoba) seed, organic essential fatty acids of oenothera biennis (evening primrose), linum usitatissimum (linseed) seed & borago officinali (borage) seed, organic honey, vitis vinifera (grape) seed oil, organic algae extract, squalane, limnanthes alba (meadowfoam) seed oil, tocopheryl acetate (vitamin E), retinyl palmitate (vitamin A), magnesium ascorbyl phosphate (vitamin C), panthenol (vitamin B5), hyaluronic acid, hydroxypropyl starch phosphate, glyceryl stearate, potassium sorbate, phospholipids, beta carotene, palmitic acid, stearic acid, cetearyl glucoside, xanthan gum, disodium edta, sodium hydroxide, benzyl alcohol, phenoxyethanol, litsea cubeba (may chang), cananga odorata (ylang ylang), boswellia carterii (frankincense) & commiphora myrrha pure essential oils. I have to give them credit, they sure pack a lot of ingredients into their formulas. But this is the first red flag. In fact, it could be a basic Beauty Brains belief . “BEWARE OF LONG INGREDIENT LISTS” You don’t need a lot of ingredients to make a good moisturizer so when you see a long list you can be fairly certain that the company is trying to trick you. Why have carrots, aloe, grape juice, rose hip, jojoba, linseed, ylang ylang and more? Is this a martini, a salad or a moisturizer? Of the nearly 40 ingredients in the formula, only about 12 of them are actually making the product work. Those are the thickeners (hydroxypropyl starch phosphate, xanthan gum), and the “fatty/oily/moisturizing” materials (palmitic acid, stearic acid, cetearyl glucoside, glycerin). Other cosmetic ingredients like sodium hydroxide, benzyl alcohol, phenoxyethanol & disodium EDTA are for preservation and formula adjustment. All of these ingredients can be found in less expensive store brands. The rest of the ingredients are marketing fluff to make you think the product is worth more. Juice Beauty story On their website, Juice Beauty has the quote “Buy it because it’s organic…use it because it works.” They then go on to explain why “organic” is better than “non-organic” in an interesting Question and Answer section. In reality, no one has ever shown proof that using “organic” ingredients in skin care products will make them work any better or be any safer for you. It’s one of those things that might feel better even though it’s not. Brain’s Bottom line Juice Beauty moisturizer contains ingredients proven to help moisturize your dried out skin. But these ingredients are the same ones you’ll find in less expensive store brands so you might want to try those products first. While Juice Beauty moisturizer is 50% more expensive, it’s not 50% better. Do you use Juice Beauty products? What do you think of them?

Ojon worked okay as long as I used their $55 stuff in the jar a full night before each washing. It does not last long with me because I have a ton of hair! It is too expensive to keep up that ritual, I just think there has to be a shampoo and conditioner out there that will not dry out my hair and at the same time not weigh it down.

"The Beauty Brains","2015-11-19 08:25:00","Will color protecting products really protect your color? by The Beauty Brains Cindi says… My stylist keeps pushing “color-protecting” shampoo and conditioners at me. I was under the impression that no products like these could really help keep color lasting longer. Are there any kinds of shampoos and/or conditioners that really work better for color-treated hair? Left Brain’s colorful reply. You are right to be skeptical. The fact is most “color-protecting” products are really not much different than the regular products. You can see this by simply taking a look at the list of ingredients (LOI). Let’s do a comparison of a salon brand, their color SKU versus a non-color one… Paul Mitchell Color Protecting Shampoo Water (Aqua), Sodium Myreth Sulfate, Ammonium Lauryl Sulfate, Cocamidoproply Betaine, Cocamide MEA, , Polyquaterium-44, Pathenol, Hydrolyzed Wheat Starch Protein, Cinnamidopropyltrimonium Chloride, Glycerine Stearate, Helianthus Annus (Sunflower) Extract, Dimethicone Bisamino Hydroxypropyl Copolyol/Hedychium Coronarium (White Ginger)/PEG-12 Dimethicone, Dimethicone Bisamino Hydroxypropyl Copolyol/Algae/Aloe Barbadensis Leaf/Athemis Nobilis/Lawsonia Inermis (Henna)/Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba)/Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary)/PEG-12 Dimethicone, Hydroxypropyl Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Glycol Distearate, Steareth-4, Fragrance(Perfum), Citric Acid, Tetrasodium EDTA, Sodium Chloride, DMDM, Hydantoin, Iodpropynyl Butylcarbarmate Paul Mitchell Super Skinny Shampoo Water (Aqua), Sodium Myreth Sulfate, Cocamide MEA, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate. Isoceteth-20, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine, PEG-150 Distearate, PEG-3 Dioleoylamidoethylmonium Methosulfate, Trimethylsiloxyamodimethicone, C11-15 Pareth-7, C12-16 Pareth-9, Glycerin, Trideceth-12, Polyquaternium-10, Triethyl Citrate, Bisamino PEG/PPG-41/3 Aminoethyl PG-Propyl Dimethicone/Algae/Aloe Barbadensis Leaf/Anthemis Noblis/Lawsonia Inemis (Henna)/Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba)/Rosmarnus Officinalis (Rosemary)/PEG-12 Dimethicone, Fragrance (Parfume), Citric Acid, Sodium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, DMDM Hydantoin, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate But if we remove things like fragrance, preservatives, claims ingredients and adjusting ingredients we’re left with… Paul Mitchell Color Protecting Shampoo Water (Aqua), Sodium Myreth Sulfate, Ammonium Lauryl Sulfate, Cocamidoproply Betaine, Cocamide MEA, , Polyquaterium-44, Glycol Distearate, Steareth-4 Paul Mitchell Super Skinny Shampoo Water (Aqua), Sodium Myreth Sulfate, Cocamide MEA, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate. Isoceteth-20, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine, PEG-150 Distearate, PEG-3 Dioleoylamidoethylmonium Methosulfate, Trimethylsiloxyamodimethicone, Polyquaternium-10 They are still a bit different but not much. The most important thing is that the first 2 ingredients are the same (water & sodium myreth sulfate) and so is the secondary surfactant, Cocamidopropyl Betaine. Unfortunately, neither of these products will protect your hair color much. Actually, the Super Skinny shampoo would probably work better for protecting color because it has silicone and conditioning agents in it. The only shampoo products that have shown some color protection are Tresemme and L’Oreal Colorvive shampoos. And even these products aren’t great because you still lose most of your color. From a conditioner standpoint, there are no standard rinse conditioners that help protect your color. Your best bet is to use a leave-in conditioner spray. This will allow you to get the benefit from the conditioning agents without the negative effects of rinse water. Beauty Brains bottom line Protecting color from the damage caused by washing, heat and the environment is one of the hottest areas of research in the cosmetic industry. It seems there are papers published every month about the subject and no one has figured it out just yet. The shampoos and conditioners out there now won’t live up to their promise. Right now, your best bet for keeping your color is to wash less often and use a leave-in conditioner.","Will color protecting products really protect your color?","0ee84742afdd0779e5380a709e80b2061b981889","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2007/06/will-color-protecting-products-really-protect-your-color/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Why do I have to reapply sunscreen? by The Beauty Brains Cubelixa’s question… I’ve been wondering about this for quite a while now. What happens to my sunscreen if I apply it to my face in the morning and then go to work (I’m an office girl)? If I don’t do sport and sweat a lot, take a bath or rub my face with my hands, do I still have to re-apply it several times throughout the day or will it protect me just fine the entire day? What happens to it? The Right Brain’s response: It’s true that sunscreen needs to be replenished if it’s removed by washing or sweating or rubbing. But that’s not the only reason it needs to be reapplied. Chemical sunscreens actually “wear out” over time. Sun damaged sunscreens UV absorbers work by trapping high energy photons in their structure. This process excites the absorbing molecule and causes it to re-emit the energy from the photon in a harmless form. But the sunscreen molecule can only go through so many “absorb and re-emit” cycles before it begins to deteriorate. This is more common in strong sunlight and it’s why you have to reapply more lotion to maintain your Sun Protection Factor. If you’re in the office as you describe, it’s less likely to be a problem for you. U This WebMD article provides some general details on sunscreen application that may be helpful. And here’s another source that explains that although this photodegradation of of UV absorbers is not fully understood that it can be reduced by adding stabilizing components. For instance, there is some evidence that the addition Mexoryl SX can reduce the photodegradation of Parsol 1789. Sunscreen breakdown can also be slowed down with the addition of other ingredients such as iron chelators or vitamins C or E. This also helps to explain why you shouldn’t mix sunscreens with other lotions, you may be inadvertently messing up a formula that has been balanced to protect the photo-stability of the active ingredient.","Why do I have to reapply sunscreen?","34fe0bd335cebf8a0fcf1f0c0e5edd721d80782e","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2010/03/why-do-i-have-to-reapply-sunscreen/"
"The Beauty Brains","2017-07-28 15:53:00","Is silica powder in makeup forever hd powder dangerous? by The Beauty Brains HeyHazelHazel… Recently I’ve heard that silica powder, like Coastal Scent’s silica powder spheres can cause Silicosis. I thought it was the same thing as Make Up Forever’s HD powder, which is also listed it’s ingredients as 100% mineral silica powder. Are they really the same? Are either of them going to cause Silicosis if I breath them? Both of them float around in the air really easily when you open their jars. The Right Brain replies: For those of our readers who aren’t familiar with Silicosis, it’s a lung condition caused crystalline silica is inhaled. This chemical is toxic to the lining of the lung and causes a strong inflammatory response. Over time this inflammation causes the lung tissue to become thickened and scarred. Symptoms of Silicosis include: chronic dry cough, shortness of breath, loss of appetite, trouble sleeping and nails with a bluish tint. But before you start thinking this blog is called the Bronchial Brains, let’s get back to cosmetics. Mineral Makeup Fortunately for those of us who love mineral makeup, the kind of silica powder used in cosmetics is not a problem. Hydrated silica (aka silicone dioxide) is a mineral used in many mineral makeup products including Makeup Forever HD and Coastal Scents. This type of silica doesn’t react with lung tissue like the crystalline form does so these products are safe to use. As Forum member Guiness pointed out, additional information on hydrated silica can be found at Cosmeticsinfo.org. So you can stop fuming about your foundation. The Beauty Brains bottom line We’re glad we can help clarify the difference between confusing chemicals.

"The Beauty Brains","","Cosmetic safety: Will hair dye give you cancer? by The Beauty Brains Every so often you hear about how chemicals in your cosmetics are responsible for cancer, birth defects or even autism. Unfortunately, the sources for these conclusions are rarely cited and when they are, they are typically a biased political committee or marketing group. This article about hair dye and cancer caught my eye. Reading the title is downright scary “Can dyeing your hair really give you cancer?” The article continues to discuss a major conference that is being held in Belfast in which they’ll discuss the long-term link between bladder cancer and people with dyed hair. It even states Evidence exists to indicate regular and long term use of hair dyes can be associated with the development of the cancer which kills more than 4,000 in the UK each year. Now, if this article was all you read on the subject, you might conclude that hair dye causes bladder cancer. You might also get the impression that experts are in agreement. After all, they did get their information from Questor a European Environmental Research Centre. Being the skeptical Beauty Brain that I am, I went to see what the medical journals had to say on the subject. A search of ‘hair dye’ resulted in 649 hits. The most current research is most useful and for answering questions like these, review articles are best. Review articles are designed to summarize all the work that has been published before. Does hair dye cause cancer? This article about hair dye and cancer published in late 2006 in the Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health concludes “Results for bladder cancer studies suggest that subsets of the population may be genetically susceptible to hair dye exposures, but these findings are based on small subgroups in one well-designed case-control study. Replication of these findings is needed to determine whether the reported associations are real or spurious.” This is a bit different than the definitive bladder cancer/hair dye link suggested in the newspaper article. Essentially the researchers say certain genetically predisposed people may have issues, but even this isn’t a certainty. A more thorough study is needed. But the important implication is that for most people, this isn’t a problem. Hair dye will not cause cancer. Beauty Brains’ bottom line What you read, see or hear in the mainstream media rarely tells the whole story. When it comes to issues about health and safety you would not be wrong to immediately reject their conclusions. If you want to know the real story do a little research from yourself using the least biased sources you can find. Research in this case would find that the majority of research shows no established link between hair dye and cancer. So, feel free to color with abandon. I know I will. For a more thorough summary of the cancer/hair color research look at this article published in The Journal of the American Medical Association .","Cosmetic safety: Will hair dye give you cancer?","9e3bec43c0d5eb6d5da24ff0c2d28ee3c4899267","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2007/06/cosmetic-safety-will-hair-dye-give-you-cancer/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Why are products from Lush more expensive? by The Beauty Brains Debby asks… I use skincare products from Lush . I love their moisturizer “Gorgeous” but it is rather expensive. Lush claims that this cream is expensive because the ingredients are really expensive. Other companies would sell it at a much higher price. Is this true? The Right Brain Responds: From a Marketing perspective, we agree that Lush is a terrific brand – their products have a cool and funky look and feel that you don’t see anywhere else. It’s hard NOT to love this stuff! However, from a scientific perspective, we don’t think that Lush is doing anything that technically special. Let’s look at the example of the moisturizer you gave us: Lush Ingredients: Olive Oil, Stearic Acid, Cold Pressed Evening Primrose Oil, Cold Pressed Avocado Oil, Glycerine, Coconut Oil, Fresh Lemon Juice, Cold Pressed Wheatgerm Oil, Triethanolamine , Fresh Pineapple Juice, Orange Flower Absolute, Neroli Oil, Myrrh Resinoid, Cetearyl Alcohol, Perfume, Methylparaben, Propylparaben Based on the ingredients, this looks like a good, lightweight moisturizer. The Stearic Acid and Triethanolamine combine to form a soap that emulsifies the natural oils and allows them to form a stable mixture with the water. Water and oil? Speaking of water – where is it? Is this product better because it doesn’t have any water and it’s more concentrated? No, because you couldn’t make a product like this without water. So, Lush has made it with pineapple and lemon juice instead, so water doesn’t show up on the ingredient list . Does this make it a better product? Not really. Pineapple and lemon juice don’t have any specific skin benefits when used in this way. What about the natural oils? Well, Olive Oil is a good moisturizer (not as good as Petrolatum or dimethicone, but it will work.) Same is true for the Coconut Oil. Primrose Oil does contain natural Essential Fatty Acids which are good for skin, but lots of other products use Primrose Oil too. The other stuff in the formula, like glycerine and the parabens are pretty much standard ingredients you’d see in any skin moisturizer. The cost of living lush And what about the price? According to Lush , this stuff sells for $72.00 for 1.5 oz. Does the cost come from the ingredients? Based on what we know about the price ingredients, the cost of ingredients for 1.5 oz of a formula like this would be about $1.00. Ok, maybe it’s $2.00. But it couldn’t be much more than that. That doesn’t mean the company is being dishonest, or any thing like that. As with most cosmetic products the ingredients don’t usually cost that much. The majority of the cost of the product is in packaging, shipping, advertising, manufacturing overhead, etc etc. For what it’s worth, Lush’s ingredients are probably a bit more expensive than most other “regular” brands. The Beauty Brains bottom line Lush does a nice job of formulating “natural” products but that doesn’t mean that these products work any better. If you really like the way the products feel on your skin and you can afford them, then they’re probably a good deal for you. But don’t spend more money on Lush just because you think the natural ingredients are superior.","Why are products from Lush more expensive?","5e512360da9dae1f958f8f22b3f9a0e8bd5b5aee","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2010/03/why-are-products-from-lush-more-expensive/"
"Randy Schueller","","Are snail creams good for your skin by Randy Schueller Melia muses…. There is alot of hype going on about snail creams where I live. I have friends who have used them for scar reduction/healing for acne and thought that they really did work (they got the tip from their dermatologist). I’ve just watched the millionth infomercial about one of these creams and am wondering if they really live up to the claims. The Beauty Brains leaves a slimy trail: When I initially heard about snail extract being used in cosmetics my BS detector kicked into over drive. After doing a little bit of research I’m still skeptical but at least I was able to find SOME scientific basis for using this ingredient in cosmetics. What is snail extract? The technical name for snail slime is “Helix Aspersa Müller Glycoconjugates.” It’s described as a thick fluid gathered by stimulating live snails. (Sounds like a job Sarah Bellum would enjoy.) Chemically speaking, snail slime is a complex mixture of proteoglycans, glycosaminoglycans, glycoprotein enzymes, hyaluronic acid, copper peptides, antimicrobial peptides and trace elements including copper, zinc, and iron. The science of snail slime There are a number of brands that claim to harness the power of snail trails. For example, there’s Bioskincare , who says their product “protects, deeply moisturizes, renews and triggers the regeneration of skin damaged by acne, injuries, overstretching, photo-aging or dermatological/medical treatments.” Is there any real science that supports the benefits of snail extract? Sort of. There are certainly plenty of references in the scientific literature. First of all, there a number of patents related to how to gather the secretion and process it for use in cosmetics. One Chilean doctor, for example, patented a procedure for gathering the secretions by agitating snails in warm water and then filtering the mucin. (I wonder how you can tell when the snails are sufficiently agitated?) Another patent, credited to a Spanish Oncologist, involves stressing the snails mechanically to induce the production of their mucin. I wish I could be sure that no snails were harmed in the production of this skin cream, but based on these patents, it doesn’t look good! But just because there are patents on snail slime, that doesn’t mean it actually DOES anything. If you’ll notice the patents are related to how to collect the slime, which has nothing to do with proving it really works on your skin. Will snail slime make wrinkles Es-car-go-away? So does it really work? A quick Pubmed search reveals a variety of papers describing the effect of snail slime on cell cultures. In these studies a variety of effects where seen including the proliferation of fibroblasts, stimulation of new collagen and elastin fibers, and increased production of fibronectin proteins just to name a few. But since these effects were demonstrated on cell cultures I have a hard time understanding how they relate to a topical cosmetic product. I did find a few other studies, though, that indicate snail extract improves skin condition by increasing the dermis’ natural ability to take up and hold water. And perhaps most interesting were the studies suggesting that the slime might have topical wound healing properties. There’s enough legitimate science here to make me think that snail extract may be a beneficial ingredient. However, I didn’t see any data that indicates that any specific cosmetic snail cream has any special efficacy. Until I see some controlled studies of these products, I remain skeptical. The Beauty Brains bottom line As ridiculous as this sounds at first, snail slime may be a powerful bioactive material. But translating that efficacy to a cosmetic product is another story entirely. In any given product it’s impossible to predict efficacy because it depends on the quality of the snail extract that was used, the amount in the product, and how it’s formulated and processed. Until a marketer of these products can demonstrate they have data on their specific product, I would avoid spending a lot of money on snail creams. What do YOU think? Would you use snail snot to keep your skin looking younger? Or is it just too gross?

"The Beauty Brains","","Do curling shampoos really work? by The Beauty Brains Charlotte Comments: I’d love to believe that those curling shampoos will really shape my thick hair. What do the Brain’s Believe? The Right Brain Responds : Well, Charlotte, this is an easy one. Curling shampoos do NOT make your hair curly. In fact, if you read the labels carefully, some of them don’t even SAY they’ll make your hair curly! Let’s take a look, shall we? What do curling shampoos claim? Even the most flagrant offender of the truth, Wash n’ Curl shampoo, only IMPLIES that it will make your hair curly just from shampooing. Read the label carefully – it says it provides “the most beautiful curls with body, bounce and resilience after styling.” Well, duh! If the shampoo only makes your hair curly AFTER you style it, it’s not really doing much for you is it? What else does Wash n’ Curl say? “Your hair will be extremely curl responsive…Even dry, damaged, color treated hair will have the staying power of thick curly hair… Its special Curl Enhancers infuse hair with the Holding Power of naturally curly hair.” The chemistry of curling shampoo The only piece of truth in this claim is that the shampoo does contain something that could be called a “curl enhancer.” Looking at the ingredient list we see that it does contains a polymer (Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer), that COULD provide some styling benefits. But that would only work if it wasn’t rinsed out! Remember, just because a product contains an ingredient that does something, it doesn’t mean that it does something in that product! The rest of the claims are pretty much made up, as far as we can tell. There is no shampoo technology that will measurably improve the holding power of your hair. What about other products, you ask? Well here’s two more: KMS Curl Up Shampoo and Marc Anthony Strictly Curls. Neither of these shampoos make strong curling claims. KMS only promises to be your “curl’s best friend, ” to ” start your style in the shower,” and to “boost boisterous curls while adding moisture and shine.” Marc, on the other hand, offers to protect color; repair dry, frizzy areas, and repel humidity to define shiny, soft, curls. (“Define” curls is not really a very emphatic claim.) Aside from a little polyquaternium (a conditioning ingredient) neither of these products have any curling technology either. We could go on and on, but you get the picture. These shampoos don’t have anything in them to make your hair curly. They don’t even really do anything to prepare your hair for styling, other than getting it clean. If you want to see more, click the carousel below.

"Randy Schueller","2015-08-17 09:57:00","Are living proof no frizz products good for curly hair? by Randy Schueller Vananners asks… Hi! A while back I read an article about an “innovative” new hair product called “No Frizz” by Living Proof. The article stated that this product was an amazing new anti-frizz product for hair, silicone-free, that works better than anything else before. They use something called “PolyfluoroEster.” I was wondering, from an ingredients standpoint, what the brains think of this product? It’s so expensive and I want to be sure nothing else exists like this on the market (for cheaper) before I spend the big bucks. Thanks! The Right Brain responds: Living Proof has generated quite a buzz since it’s launch late in 2008. For example, here’s an article from Xconomy.com that describes the secrecy around the brand’s initial roll out. The basic idea is that an MIT professor and a capital venture company teamed up to create the first new anti-frizz technology in 30 years. It was all very hush-hush until the last few months. Since this article was written, we’ve learned a lot more about Living Proof’s frizz fighters. How Living Proof Works The quick story is this: instead of conventional conditioning agents like silicones, Living Proof uses a type of chemical known as a PolyfluoroEster (or PFE for short) to smooth the hair shaft and prevent moisture from being absorbed. Is this a breakthrough? Well, there have been dozens of new silicone compounds created over the last few decades that serve a similar function so we think the claim of this being the “first new anti-frizz technology in 30 years” is a bit of an exaggeration. But PFEs (which are Teflon-like compounds) are VERY good at lowering surface tension, and so in theory they could provide the three main benefits that Living Proof claims on their website: Frizz prevention Living Proof products are formated to leave “a smooth, perfect layer” on your hair that “adheres tightly to the hair, which allows for long-lasting moisture resistance and rebalancing of the hair fiber’s interaction with the atmosphere, even after extreme humidity.” This layer reduces swelling of the hair shaft due to moisture absorption which in turn prevents the cuticles from lifting up and causing frizz. Dirt repellancy PFE’s repel materials like water and oils, “translating into a non-greasy coating that doesn’t attract dirt and other particulates.” They claim that Living Proof makes hair “more repellent to dirt and particles than natural hair.” Shine and color enhancement The PFE coating has a very low refractive index that produces a “unique, long-lasting shine and “pop” in the color of the hair.” The Beauty Brains bottom line We haven’t tested these products but we have worked with similar chemistry in the past so we know that PFEs are highly functional. Based on looking at the ingredient list of the products, the formulas contain a relatively high percentage of PFEs instead of more typical frizz fighters. Therefore we’d expect these products would leave a very different feel on the hair. We’re not aware of any other products on the market that are formulated quite like this. Are they worth the price ($24)? We don’t know, but they do appear to have a scientific basis for their claims and we’re anxious to give them a try. Has anyone used Living Proof?

"The Beauty Brains","","Does curly hair need special ingredients? by The Beauty Brains Mary Muses… Hi, I have a couple questions: 1) I’ve heard that there are certain ingredients in shampoos that can be too harsh for curly hair (which tends to be drier) and so should be avoided. Is there much truth to this? 2) I often see articles in magazines that claim that you can help a conditioning treatment work better by adding heat– for example, applying the conditioner to your hair, then wrapping your hair in a towel or shower cap and blasting it with your hair dryer for a few minutes, to help the treatment “penetrate the hair” better. Is there any truth to this? The Right Brain ‘s Hair-Curling Reply: 1) Curly hair hair does have some special needs. Because of the way it kinks and bends, it can be break more easily than straight hair. It’s not exactly correct that it’s drier, it’s just that the effects of lack of moisture are more devastating. In other words, it’s not that some shampoo ingredients are too harsh, it’s just that your hair needs more conditioning than some shampoos can offer. Condition your curly hair So, what does this mean? If you have VERY dry, very curly hair, then you should be conditioning every time you shampoo. Maybe even using a conditioning shampoo on top of using your conditioners. And you may need a styling aid that provides supplemental conditioning. You should consider a conditioning mousse or some kind of combing cream. Heat your conditioner? 2) As we’ve discussed before, the conditioners work on the surface of your hair. So leaving it on longer or adding heat to make it penetrate better really has little benefit. In some cases, heat can even be damaging. The most important step is to work the conditioner through your hair really well. In most cases you can skip adding heat.","Does curly hair need special ingredients?","a458e352efe4a0f0cc98afceaea3509736d12c01","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2008/11/does-curly-hair-need-special-ingredients/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Are curly hair styling products different? by The Beauty Brains Nanda Has Curly Curiosity… Hi there! Thanks for your great work on your blog. I have thick curly hair, and it seems the only thing that reliably defines my frizzy curls is a little known product called Dudley’s Fantastic Body Texturizing Setting Lotion. It’s fairly inexpensive, since my hairdresser has me mix it with water before spraying it on my head. It’s water-based, and so unlike gels and creams, it doesn’t build up at all. Also, I keep hearing raves about another product that sounds very similar, called Curly Hair Solutions Curl Keeper. Could you help me determine if they’re as similar as they sound? The Right Brain Chemically Corresponds: Nanda, the products that you’re considering are quite different based on the ingredient lists. Let’s take a look: Dudley’s Fantastic Body Setting Lotion: Deionized Water, Polyquaternium-11, PEG-75, Lanolin, Polysorbate-60, Diazolidinyl Urea (and) Iodopropynl Butylcarbamate, Fragrance, FD & C Blue No.1. Curly Hair Solutions Curl Keeper: Deionized Water, PVP/VA Copolymer, Propylene Glycol, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Laureth 23, Glycerin, DMDM Hydantoin, Fragrance, Polyquaternium 10. The key active ingredient in Dudley’s is Polyquaternium-11. A conditioning ingredient used in many mousses. It will make your hair soft and help defrizz curls. Curly Hair Solutions, on the other hand, contains PVP/VA copolymer which is a pretty powerful film former. This product also has the ability to shape your curls but it will leave a crispy feeling styling crust, more like a gel or hairspray. Both products could keep your curls controlled; it depends on the type of feel you like. If you like a very soft feel, stick with Dudley’s. If you want a firmer feel, go for Curly. But in neither case should you be diluting them with water. By adding water you could inactivate the antimicrobial control agents in the formula leaving the product open to bacteria growth which is not a good thing.

"The Beauty Brains","","Is jessicurl good for curly hair? by The Beauty Brains Julie’s curl curious: Do the ingredients in the products sold at www.jessicurl.com really “offer a specific benefit to your curly hair,” as they claim? I’ve seen so many great testimonials for their products, but before I make a purchase, I want to make sure the claims have a scientific basis! The Right Brain’s Jessicurl justification: There’s no single specific technical approach to formulating products for curly hair. Instead, it’s all about finding the right balance. Here are 3 things to look out for: Amount of Conditioning Some women want lighter weight conditioning that won’t rob their fine, thin hair of curls. Others need heavier conditioning to tame unruly curls. Jessiicurl appears to offer shampoos for both ends of the conditioning spectrum with their Gentle Lather Shampoo and Hair Cleansing Cream. Their Too Shea! Extra Moisturizing Conditioner is based on shea butter which is an excellent emollient for skin but it’s not substantive to hair. While it provides a catchy name for the product, it does little from a rinse out application. Level of Hold Jessicurl’s styling products include Confident Coils Styling Solution which is built on a fairly standard backbone of polymers including vinyl pyrrolidone and Vinyl Acetate. These provide a nice, firm hold but are not very humidity resistant. Her inclusion of magnesium sulfate is an interesting addition because of the texture and crunch it can give to curly hair. However, it won’t be very long lasting because this kind of film is relatively easy to disrupt. Sensory Styling Suprisingly, her Rockin’ Ringlets and Gelebration spray are based on flax seed extract which we have not seen used in styling before. This ingredient will not give long lasting hold but it could provide a very different feel and texture to the hair. The Beauty Brains bottom line If you’re a curly queen and you’re haven’t had luck with mass brands and salon products, you might give Jessicurl a try. While there’s no breakthrough technology here, these products could deliver a different look and feel for your curly hair. Based on our review of their ingredients and the benefits they claim, we’d say this is worth a shot. What do YOU think? Have you tried Jessicurl?

"The Beauty Brains","","How can you tell if skin brightening products really work? by The Beauty Brains Emi’s inquiry: I have a question about a product from a natural skincare company “ Dr. Hauschka’s Moisturizing Day Cream “. It purports to brighten dull skin. I know all of the ingredients are supposed to be biodynamically grown and are all natural (and it smells nice), but what is it in there that can actually “brighten” dull, pale skin? The Right Brain’s bright reply: We`ll avoid the temptation to continue the Left Brain`s debate about natural products and focus on the question of skin brightening claims. First, you have to realize that there is no rule book that tells cosmetic companies what they have to do to support their claims. The law (at least here in the US) only says that you have to HAVE supporting data for your claims and that you have to make that data available when necessary. The law doesn`t say anything about the quality of that data. Now, most of the larger companies in the industry are pretty careful to make sure they have supporting data. But some of the smaller companies are a bit more¦flexible, shall we say. Big or small, there are two basic approaches that companies use when supporting claims: They can document that the ingredient or the formula is generally recognized to be efficacious, or they can actually test their formula. Case in point, Dr. Hauschka’s Day Cream. Looking at their ingredients, we don’t see anything in the formula that is widely known to have skin brightening properties. That doesn’t mean that the formula WON’T brighten your skin, it only means that the burden of proof is on the company to demonstrate that efficacy. But since companies don’t have to cough up any proof unless they’re legally challenged, we’ll probably never know for sure. If we had to guess, we’d say that if they did any testing, it was probably some kind of perception study that shows people think their skin looks brighter after using this lotion. Or, if this were a skin cleanser, they could have made the claim based on simple exfoliation. If the product is stripping off the upper dead, dull layers of skin on the surface, then it`s revealing the brighter layers beneath. This is pure speculation on our part. There`s no way to tell how this company would support this claim. Dr. Hauschka may have a very nice moisturizer, but the idea of brightening is really not very meaningful. In case you’re interested, here are the ingredients: Water, Anthyllis Vulneraria Extract, Apricot Kernel Oil, Alcohol, Witch Hazel Extract, Sweet Almond Oil, Olive Oil, Carrot Extract, Peanut Oil, Wheat Germ Oil, St. John’s wort, Glycerin, Calendula Officinalis Extract, Lecithin, Jojoba Oil, Fragrance/Parfum, Limonene, Linalool, Farnesol, Benzyl Benzoate, Geraniol, Citronellol, Benzyl Salicylate, Citral, Algin, Xanthan Gum One final note: there is another approach to skin brightening that involves blocking the mechanism that causes skin to develop dark spots. That’s the glycosamine technology used in Olay’s Definity. But that’s a story for another post.","How can you tell if skin brightening products really work?","896671728771d63ec1220b29d00898633bf04e4d","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2007/06/how-can-you-tell-if-skin-brightening-products-really-work/"
"The Beauty Brains","","What does SPF really mean? by The Beauty Brains Brittany asks… Ok, I feel kind of stupid asking this because everyone else probably already know this but what exactly does SPF mean? I mean I know it stands for Sun (Solar?) Protecting Factor but what does that mean? The Right Brain responds: As far as we’re concerned, Brittany, there are no stupid questions. In fact, you raise a very good question because we think that a lot of people are unclear of the real answer. So, in today’s post we’ll spell out exactly what SPF means. The ABCs of SPF First of all, you were close on the meaning of the acronym. SPF actually stands for Sun Protection Factor. This factor is a measure of how much Ultraviolet, or UV, radiation it takes to burn your skin when it’s unprotected compared to how much it takes to burn it when it’s slathered in sunscreen. The higher the SPF value of your sunscreen, the more protection it offers from sunburn. Now, here’s the tricky part. Many people think that SPF relates to how much time you can spend in the sun. In other words, if you can stay in the sun for 30 minutes before burning and you wear a sunscreen with an SPF of 10, you should be able to stay in the sun for 30 x 10 = 300 minutes or 5 hours before burning. Right? WRONG! Why is it wrong? Because SPF doesn’t just relate to the duration of sun exposure – it relates to the amount of sun exposure. Time is one factor that contributes to the total exposure level but it’s not the ONLY factor. The intensity of the UV radiation also impacts the amount. For example, one hour of sunlight at 9:00 in the morning is equivalent to 15 minutes of sunlight at 1:00 in the afternoon. So if you’re only looking at how long you’re out in the sun you might drastically under estimate how much sun exposure you’re really getting. Geography is another factor: sunlight is more intense the closer you are to the equator. And weather is yet another consideration: even though you can get a sunburn on cloudy days, the effect of sunlight is generally more intense when the sky is clear. The Beauty Brains bottom line The SPF value of a product does NOT tell you how long you can stay out in the sun before you burn. It only tells you the relative difference between the level of protection provided by different products. Source: FDA.gov Do YOU have a favorite sunscreen?

"The Beauty Brains","","The beauty of beer by The Beauty Brains Lena loves lager: I love your site. Thanks for giving intelligent and scientifically sound beauty advice, something that seems to be woefully scarce. So here’s my question: I have heard about people using flat beer as a rinse for their hair, and also I’ve seen shampoo from Lush with beer as its featured ingredient. I’m wondering what exactly it is that people claim beer accomplishes, and whether it really does do what they say. Thanks! The Right Brain pours a cold frosty reply: Believe it or not, beer really is good for your hair! Here’s how it works: It’s about 2 am and the guy at the bar who’s been ogling you over his last 6 or 8 bottles of Bud Light staggers in your general direction. He moves in for kill, getting up in your face and suavely blurting out: “Gee yer hair looksh aweshum! *Hic*.” That kind of drunken compliment is about the most benefit your hair will get from beer. But all kidding aside, is there any plausible reason to put beer in your hair? Let’s take a sip, shall we… Beer buzz There are several theoretical arguments for putting beer on your hair. Unfortunately, none of them can hold their liquor. Beer contains protein which is good for strengthening hair. While beer does contain corn, wheat, or rice protein it’s not in the correct form to deposit on your hair and form a stengthening film, which is how proteins work. Beer has a low pH which can tighten the cuticles and make your hair shiny. The pH of beer is low due to dissolved carbon dioxide but it’s not enough to make a difference to the condition of hair. Beer contains herbs known as hops which are natural astringents that have beneficial tightening effect on the scalp. Hops are present at a very low level and are not in contact with your skin long enough to have a measurable effect. Beer contains alcohol which is good for removing dirt and grease from hair. The cleansing power of the relatively low amount of alcohol in beer pales in comparison to shampoo. The Beauty Brains bottom line While beer won’t HURT your hair (other than making it smelly), it certainly doesn’t provide any technical benefit. We say save it for drinking! What do you think?

"Perry Romanowski","None","Is argan oil good for hair and skin by Perry Romanowski Noelle needs to know: I read your post regarding coconut oil penetrating hair. How about argan oil? It seems to be the new cosmetic hype, with several brands launching their “miraculous” argan oil-based hair treatment for 45 dollars or more.. (Ahem) Is there any kind of research providing evidence that argan oil can restore health and shine to the hair? They say that argan oil has been used for centuries by Moroccan women to restore skin, hair and nails. Does this Moroccan oil really work? The Right Brain’s oily answer: Could argan oil be the new coconut oil ? Let’s take a look. What is argan oil? Argan oil is produced from the kernels of argan tree fruit. These trees only grow in a few regions, like Morocco, so this oil is one of the rarest in the world due the small supply and the limited growing area – hence the high price and the hype. Traditionally the oil is produced by hand. First the soft pulp is stripped from the nuts which are then laid out in the sun to dry. Stones are used to crack open the dried nuts so the seeds can be removed. Next, they’re gently roasted to give the oil a rich, nutty flavor. A little water is added to the roasted seeds and they are ground into a thick paste which is squeezed by hand to extract the oil. Legend has it that there’s another way to produce this precious oil: Breaking open the nut shells is really hard work and the Moroccans have found that it’s easier wait for their goats to eat the fruit (yes, goats are big fans of argan fruit. They’ll even try to climb trees in search of this succulent treat!) The seeds pass through the goat’s digestive track and emerge on the other end a bit softer since they’re partially digested. So, all the Moroccans have to do is follow the goats around and wait for the seeds to… uh, reappear. The good news is that the post-goat seeds are much easier to break open. The bad news is that they are tainted with the distinctive odor of goat intestines which is less than ideal by most standards. Is this legend true? Probably not, according to several of the comments we’ve received on this topic. But we never pass up the opportunity to make a goat poop reference. What is argan oil used for? Regardless of how it’s made, chemically speaking argan oil consists of a blend of fatty acids (over 70% oleic and linoleic acids.) It is also rich in vitamin E, phenols, and carotenes. Historically argan oil has been used in cooking for dipping bread, on couscous, or on salads. But since it’s so rich in essential fatty acids, there’s no reason it couldn’t be used in skin or hair treatments. In fact, there has some research that indicates that argan oil may be an treatment for psoriasis. And Pubmed references at least one study that shows argan oil reduces sebum production . (We couldn’t find any specific research on argan oil in hair care.) The only downside to using argan oil in cosmetics, besides the potential lack of supply and high cost, is the fact that it contains a lot of oleic acid which is highly comedogenic. So while it may be good for oily skin and psoriasis, it could clog pores and cause inflammatory acne. You might have to arm yourself with an anti-acne device like Thermaclear .

"admin","","Should you use the Clarisonic skin care system by admin Clarisonic Skin Care System – Pink Think you’ve removed all your makeup with your cleanser? There is probably makeup, dirt, and other impurities left behind after you cleanse that you can’t even see. Clarisonic Skin Care System removes six times more makeup than cleansing alone Our previous Clarisonic assessment sparked a bit of controversy with one responder claiming “you are a complete idiot…before you write a hack review on a product know what you are talking about first.” Ouch! Sometimes it’s hard to be a Beauty Brain . Mostly, we ignore criticism like this, but two things happened. First, my sister asked if stimulating skin makes it produce extra collagen and I was not sure. Then we serendipitously got another Clarisonic device in the mail. Since the Clarisonic definitely stimulates skin it got us Beauty Brains talking about it again. Sarah said it was a sign. I do not believe in signs, but was interested enough to take a closer look at Clarisonic. Clarisonic Science The Clarisonic Skin System is a water-proof, hand-held device with a vibrating brush head. You apply a cleanser then move the brush on your face in a circular patter. A built-in timer tells you when to move from one face section to the next. Think of it like a high-tech poof or washcloth. The product claims to use “sonic technology” which is not defined. I guess it is a reference to the brush heads which move at “super-sonic” speed? The brushes do move fast and that helps clean skin. Certainly, Clarisonic was trying to get people to connect sonic toothbrush technology with this product figuring if one works so will the other. They do have a few patents on the design and the motor. (US 7,157,816) Clarisonic Exfoliation We mentioned in the previous post you could probably get the same effect by exfoliating. One reader pointed out that Clarisonic does not exfoliate. True, Clarisonic does not advertise itself as an exfoliating system, but it does lightly exfoliate your skin so keep your daily use limited. Clarisonic Claims Clarisonic makes the following 3 primary claims and a few soft ones. More than twice as effective as manual cleansing We don’t have access to their test data, but this claim is confusing. What exactly does it mean? Do they mean effectiveness at cleaning? It seems like it but that’s not clear. No set guidelines means companies can come up with any reasonable test and report positive numbers. So, if Clarisonic could’ve found some specific compound removed better with their device than manual cleansing they could make the claim. That doesn’t mean your face will be twice as clean. 6 times more make-up removed Without their test data/protocol it is hard to say exactly how they proved this. However, you can bet the number sounds much more impressive than what you’ll experience in reality. If manual cleansing is done properly, it adequately removes make-up. 61% greater vitamin C absorption We don’t know how they proved this, but it was most likely an in vitro test (lab) meant to simulate human skin. It is doubtful that you’ll get 61% vitamin C absorption in real use and even more doubtful you would notice if you did. Clarisonic soft claims The soft claims include “reducing the appearance of visible pores” and “reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.” You prove these using consumer panelists who try the product and answer some questionnaires. ANY product will score well in a test like this, especially one like Clarisonic which is novel and feels good when you use it. While it will “appear” to you that your pores & wrinkles are reduced, don’t count on them actually being affected. Clarisonic and Collagen As to my sister’s question about stimulating the production of collagen, there is no definitive evidence that it does. Some in vitro studies have suggested it might. The company does not make this claim so they haven’t done the testing. It would be a big challenge to safely design this kind of study anyway. So, it probably doesn’t stimulate collagen production but it won’t hurt. Clarisonic Benefits Beyond their claims, three things make Clarisonic interesting to try. 1. Less exposure to harsh surfactants and exfoliating particles 2. Timed cleaning so you’ll be more consistent 3. It feels good While it doesn’t mean much, most people who try the Clarisonic love it. It’s a unique experience and makes face cleansing fun. Whether that is worth the >$150 price tag is only something you can decide for yourself. Will Clarisonic change the face of daily cleansing? Clarisonic requires a behavior change and most people will not be able to change for long. They’ll use it religiously for a month or so then forget to get new brushes and eventually it will end up under their bathroom sink next to their lipstick stencils . We could be mistaken, but results are not vastly different from standard cleansing so lasting behavior changes will be difficult. Beauty Brains Bottom Line There are definitely some benefits of Clarisonic over other methods of cleansing like more consistent cleansing, less exposure to harsh surfactants & exfoliating particles, and it just feels good. Who wouldn’t want a fresh-feeling face? It is also a unique alternative to standard products. We here at the Beauty Brains want to encourage all cosmetic companies to make unique products rather than unique product stories. Clarisonic is definitely a unique product. If you are unsatisfied with your current cleansing routine, try the Clarisonic Skin Care System (or something like it). –Right Brain Do you have a Clarisonic device? What do you think?

"The Beauty Brains","","Is kojic acid skin lightening safe? by The Beauty Brains Want to try Skin Lightening Forever? Click Here Right Brain reports… Kojic acid based skin lightening products, like Meladerm , have provided benefits to many people and it’s effectiveness is supported by the American Academy of Dermatology . In Europe, it is thought to be a safer alternative to hydroquinone (an ingredient banned in Europe). Kojic acid is also a natural by-product from the fermentation stage of sake production. Scientists believe it helps lighten the skin by blocking an enzyme crucial in the production of skin melanin. Anecdotal reports by Meladerm customers would support this view. Overall, it seems like a great ingredient. Or maybe not. According to a report from the European scientific body, the Scientific Committee on Consumer Products (SCCP), kojic acid used at the maximum 1% concentration level may pose a health risk. Kojic Acid Good news On the plus side, the SCCP found that kojic acid is not genotoxic or carcinogenic. (It won’t cause cancer). It also did not exhibit any reproductive toxicity. Kojic Acid Bad news On the other hand, with patch tests on real human volunteers they found that skin exposed to kojic acid on a regular basis became more sensitive. This led them to conclude kojic acid may induce skin sensitization and they want to classify it as such. Skin sensitization is bad because it could lead to allergic contact dermatitis. Kojic Conclusions This report illustrates a few important points about the chemicals in cosmetics. 1. There is debate among scientists about chemical safety. Reasonable people can disagree. Regulatory agencies in Europe and the US can look at the same safety data and come to completely different conclusions (banning hydroquinone for example). 2. Animal testing of cosmetics is still done. Even in Europe. 3. There is risk when you expose yourself to any chemical even if it has a history of safe use. If you are worried about things like this, your contact with all chemicals should be minimized. It doesn’t matter if naturally derived or not since these can be skin sensitizers too. Beauty Brains Bottom Line Results from this report are not conclusive so more testing and data collection will be done by cosmetic makers who use kojic acid. Unfortunately, few ingredients actually provide a skin lightening benefit so if that’s what you want, you’ll have to continue to use these products. But until more data is collected, you might want to apply just a little less.","Is kojic acid skin lightening safe?","6f94d5a77f2e2d3318542922c5e72ea7526e1b16","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2008/11/is-kojic-acid-skin-lightening-safe/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Hair Color: Basic Beauty Science by The Beauty Brains The Right Brain instructs… We haven’t done a Beauty Science post in a while so here’s one on hair color. Alright, admit it. You’ve gone to the salon or bought a box at the store just to change the color of your hair. It’s not surprising as over 75% of women in the United States report coloring their hair. But did you ever wonder what exactly is going on? How are your lovely brown locks transformed into sassy blond strands? A brief history of hair coloring Before we talk about how hair color is changed now, it is helpful to know how women have been modifying their hair color for centuries. Ancient Egyptians were known to use indigo leaves, black walnut shells and henna extracts to give their jet black hair reddish or bluish tints. Women in India also used henna to color their hair. Lighter colors were achieved by the ancient Roman women who used acidic plant extracts and sun to bleach their colors. Unfortunately, these natural solutions had limited and inconsistent effects. And it wasn’t until the late 1800s when hydrogen peroxide solutions were introduced that people were actually able to create truly blond hair. What makes your hair’s natural color? You might be surprised to learn that all natural hair colors are the result of only 2 types of hair pigment. That’s right, red heads, blonds, and brunettes are all created by the same 2 pigments. Both of these pigments are a type of melanin and it is produced right inside your hair follicle. Phaeomelanin is responsible for the yellowish-blond to red colors and Eumelanin is responsible for the brown to black shades. What about gray hair? Well, this is what happens when you stop producing these melanin molecules. Grey/white hair is what hair looks like when there is no pigment. How is hair color changed? If you’re like most people, you’ve changed the color of your hair at some point in your life. There are really only three ways that hair is colored, bleaching, staining, or a combination of both. Which one you use depends on primarily on factors including your starting hair color, your ending hair color, and how long you want it to last. Going lighter We’ve already talked about what gives your hair its natural color. If you have dark hair and want to go lighter then you have to do something to remove the color you’ve already got. This is where bleaching comes in. Bleach (most commonly hydrogen peroxide) chemically reacts with the hair’s melanin rendering it permanently colorless. How light it gets depends on the strength of the bleach solution and the amount of time it is left on the hair. If you have a really dark color you’ll need to use repeated applications to chemically change all of the melanin. But even if you use the strongest bleach you can find, the hair will maintain a pale yellow tint. This is due to the fact that there is still some melanin that will remain unreacted. To get all of the pigment to react, an alkaline solution is used in addition to the peroxide in order to open up the hair’s cuticles and allow the bleach into the hair shaft. Note that bleaching is a permanent color change that is not reversible. If you lighten your hair you can only go dark again by coloring it or letting new hair grow out. Making your hair darker To make hair darker you’ll need to add color to it. If you are not sure about a new color, you should start with a temporary hair colorant. Temporary or semi-permanent hair colors are stains that deposit color on the outside of the hair shaft. These are the same type of compounds people have been using for centuries. Unfortunately (or fortunately) they wash out after a number of shampooings. Of course, the lighter your hair the easier it will be to add different hair colors. If you have blond hair you can go to almost any color from black to red to brown to blue. If you have dark hair changing to a different shade will require a different strategy. Changing to a different hair color shade If you want to really change your hair color then you’ll want to have a permanent dye job. No matter what hair color you start with, permanent dying is a two-step process. First, your natural hair color is removed through the process of bleaching as described above. Then the hair dye is put on your hair where it chemically reacts to permanently change the color. Typically, both of these processes happen at the same time. The permanent hair dyes are special chemicals. They start out as tiny molecules (called monomers) that are small enough to penetrate into your hair shafts. Then when they are there, they react with each other to create bigger molecules (called polymers). These polymers are so big that they can not be washed out of your hair. They stay in your hair even through shampooing. At least they are supposed to. The problem with ‘permanent’ hair color In an ideal world, permanent hair color would stay permanent. Unfortunately, hair color can be removed and it is, EVERY TIME YOU WASH. Anytime you expose your artificial hair color to water and shampoo you lose more and more hair dye. And it doesn’t matter what kind of shampoo you are using. ALL Shampoos that require you to get your hair wet will strip hair color. This is why you are not able to keep the just-from-the-salon look for more than a couple of days. Interested in other beauty science topics?

Someone told me that witch hazel is why the product firms but the effects are only temporary. And over time my skin will stop responding to the “firming” action and there will be a rebound effect and my skin will get even looser. Is this true? Does witch hazel do such a thing? The Right Brain responds: In addition to being the namesake of a popular cartoon character, witch hazel is widely touted as an astringent. What does it do for your skin? Keep reading! Why use an astringent? First, let’s talk about what “astringent” really means. Generally the term is defined as a substance that shrinks or constricts body tissues. For example, the puckery mouth feel you get after drinking red wine is cause by a class of chemicals called tannins. The tannins react with the mucosa in your mouth causing it to feel tight and rough. In skin care, astringents impart a tightening sensation to the skin. What is witch hazel? Witch hazel is a naturally derived extract made from the bark and leaves of the North American Hamamelis virginiana shrub which grows from Nova Scotia west to Ontario, and south to Texas, and Florida. Native American Indians used witch hazel for a variety of medicinal purposes. Today it is sold primarily in an alcohol solution under brand names such as Dickinson’s . How does witch hazel work on skin? There are two theories to account for witch hazel’s astringent properties. First, it is rich in tannins which in theory can cause a mild coagulation of skin proteins. This coagulation can dry, harden, and protect the skin. Second, witch hazel is typically prepared in alcohol which has a cooling effect on skin due to its low heat of evaporation. This cooling effect can cause a temporary contraction of the skin that feels astringent. Neither of these temporary firming mechanisms have a long term effect and are not likely to produce a “rebound” condition in which your skin will become even more loose. Finally, it’s interesting to note that witch hazel is well studied for its skin protective properties. Pubmed is full of references including one that evaluates witch hazel’s ability to treat diaper rash . The Beauty Brains bottom line If you’ve found a skin firming treatment that you like, then stick with it and don’t worry about a rebound skin loosening effect. On the other hand, just remember that witch hazel and other astringents won’t prevent you from getting serious, long-term wrinkles either. What do YOU think? Do you use skin tightening products? Or would your rather have a nice glass of red wine? Leave a comment and share your thoughts with the rest of the Beauty Brains community. Reference: Erdelmeier, C. A. J. et al.

"The Beauty Brains","2015-12-12 07:54:00","Is coffee good for coloring hair? by The Beauty Brains Fiona’s fear: I use Pantene’s Brunette range of shampoos to maintain my dyed brown hair. This is met with huge scorn by my mother in law who insists that nothing is more effective at maintaining glossy brown hair than rinsing it with an espresso or two once a week. Is coffee an effective way to treat and prolonged coloured hair or is it as useful as the beer rinse (ie- not particularly). The Left Brain responds: I love questions like this because the answer can be easily proven by a simple test. But before I explain, let’s talk about products for brunette hair. Brains on Brunettes Products like Pantene’s Brunette Expressions and John Frieda’s Brilliant Brunette Luminous Color Glaze work because they contain a high concentration of dyes that stain the hair. These dyes won’t permanently color hair and they can’t lighten your natural hair color, but they can give your shade a boost that will last through several shampoos. There are lots of materials that will stain hair in a similar fashion, including fruit juices and coffee, but they won’t provide as much color as intense dyes. Colorful chemistry To find out if coffee will color hair I brewed up a pot of double strength espresso. Then I took a tress of bleached blond European hair. I used bleached hair for two reasons: the bleaching makes the hair more porous so it soaks up more of the coffee and the coffee color will show up better on light blond hair. As you can see from the “before” picture below, the hair is very blond. (This will vary depending on the color reproduction of your computer monitor.) Pre-coffee Then, I soaked the tress in coffee overnight to see how much the color would change. Here’s how the tress looked after soaking in double strength coffee for 12 hours. As you can see, the hair is a little bit darker, but not very much. (There’s a slight color shift due to the camera, but to the naked eye the hair color barely changed). If the effect is this slight on blonde hair, it will be almost impossible to detect on dark hair. So I’m afraid I’ll have to say that your mother-in-law’s assertion is incorrect. Post-coffee The Beauty Brains bottom line Based on this quick experiment, I conclude that while coffee can stain hair the effect is too slight to be a practical hair treatment. (I realize that a larger scale test with multiple hair types is required to verify these results, but based on my prior experiences in the lab this color change is pretty typical.) So don’t expect to see a Starbuck’s Shampoo or organic hair color on your local supermarket shelf anytime soon. What do YOU think? Have you ever used coffee or other homemade hair colors?

"The Beauty Brains","","4 ways to tell if your cosmetic has expired by The Beauty Brains Gilda’s guilty of using old product: I have a Matrix Sleek Look shampoo and conditioner I bought 3 years ago, Can I use it? Is it effective? The Right Brain reassures her: Three years for a shampoo or conditioner is not out of the question, so your Matrix might be fine. But what about cosmetic products in general? if you’re really worried that your product being past it’s peak, ask yourself the following questions. If the answer to any of these is YES, then you might want to splurge on a replacement. 1. Does it fail the See and Sniff test? Most cosmetics are designed to last a couple of years. A shampoo or conditioner like Matrix will probably still be fine. But before you use an old product, squeeze a little bit out and look at it and sniff it. Does it still smell okay? Maybe the fragrance just faded a bit. But if any of the ingredients have gone rancid or if there’s microbial growth, you’ll smell an off odor. Also look for junk growing in the product like mold or fungus. If you see or smell anything funky, don’t use it! Likewise, if the product changed consistency and has become way too thick or way too thin, that’s a signal that something changed. And not for the better! 2. Is it past the expiration date? Ok, this one’s tricky because most products don’t HAVE an expiration date. Over The Counter Drug products do, but most regular cosmetics won’t. If you don’t see an expiration date but you do see another string of numeric or alphanumeric code on the bottle, it’s probably the lot code. The lot code tells the company when (and even where) the product was made. It’s meant to help the company track the product so if you call them, they can tell you when the product was made and they should be able to recommend how long you can keep it before it expires. By the way, in Europe, a new law requires a PAO (Period After Opening symbol) on the package. It looks like a little jar with a number on it and it tells you how many months the product is good for after you first start using it. You’ll also see this symbol on some US products. 3. Was it stored improperly? Some products are sensitive to heat, cold, and light. For example, we recently wrote about Babor’s Intelli-zyme product that contains enzymes. Enzymes are notoriously unstable at high temperatures. Products like this can easily go bad from heat exposure. On the other hand, emulsion products, like skin lotions, can crystallize, thicken, or turn to mush if they’re frozen. There`s no way to know what happened to a product BEFORE you bought it, but you can take care to store it properly once you get it home. Don’t leave products in the trunk of your car on a hot day or a cold day. Then of course there’s the condition of the package. Was it stored in a tightly sealed opaque bottle? Then there’s less chance that light or air could have caused any problems. But if the lid is loose and it’s in a clear glass bottle that sat in the window for 3 months, forget it! 4. Does it contain any “special” ingredients that are fragile? If it’s a regular product, like the Matrix example mentioned above, you probably don’t have much to work about. But some active ingredients are a bit finicky, and those products can expire much sooner. Products like Babor’s Intelli-zyme and even sunscreens are much more delicate.

"The Beauty Brains","","How to make your eyes white by The Beauty Brains Dana dares to ask… I read your article about the eye drops that makes your eyes blue . But my question is kind of the opposite. I don’t want to make the colored part of my eyes more blue, I want to make the white part whiter. Is there anything that can do that? The Right Brain responds: You could use a product like Visine to “get the red out.” But if you REALLY want to make your whites whiter, you’ll need a more drastic solution like surgical eye whitening. Yes, that’s right. You can now have your eyes surgically whitened. Eye spy According to Inventor’s Blogspot, this procedure was developed in the early 1990s by a Korean doctor and since then about 13,000 people have had this operation. The process involves removing the outer eye membrane hat contains dark veins and other discolorations that make your eyes look dingy. After a few weeks, a new, clear membrane grows in it’s place so you’re left with a new bright, white smile. Uh, I mean bright white eyes. Apparently, the entire ordeal only takes about 20 minutes per eye. If you’re interested, here’s the website for the Boxer Wachler Vision Institute , a Los Angeles based clinic that specializes in this procedure. And it goes without saying that if you’re traveling to California for this operation, you should fly the Red Eye special. (Sorry, I couldn’t resist.) Would you have YOUR eyes surgically whitened?

"The Beauty Brains","","Is eating meat bad for your skin? by The Beauty Brains Laurie longs to learn… Is there any science behind this Mayo Clinic article ? I thought there wasn’t a link between food, acne, and/or the appearance of your skin (i.e., meat = wrinkles). The Beauty Brains respond: We’re thrilled to have a new voice on the Beauty Brains to answer your question, Laurie. Meet BeautyScientist , a cosmetic chemist from the UK. Here’s what he has to say… Forget the war in Iraq, forget PC versus Mac, forget atheism – if you really want to get into a heated argument try talking about the pros and cons of a vegetarian diet. While most people are happy to accept moral scruples about eating meat, the trouble starts when you suggest that being a vegetarian is in some way more healthy or has some other practical advantage. Boy does this seem to get some people going. I should explain that I am not a vegetarian and I have no intention of giving up eating meat any time soon if ever. But I have looked into the facts on the subject with some interest. It turns out that whatever else you might say about it, meat eating is certainly a heavy cost in terms of farmland. You need a lot of space to rear animals, and we could feed a lot more people if we were less carnivorous. I have been shouted down trying to put this point in late night conversations, even though it is both completely true and when you think about it, obvious. Veggie Tales But is the vegetarian diet good for you? I have read quite a bit on this and there doesn’t seem to be any particular evidence that it is. Indeed there doesn’t seem to be much in the way of hard data to suggest that going vegetarian makes much difference to you. One wide ranging review paper concludes that: “Overall, the data suggest that the health of Western vegetarians is good and similar to that of comparable non-vegetarians.” A largish study in the nineties did indicate that vegetarians were less likely to die of heart disease. It didn’t indicate any significant difference in actual life spans though and other diseases they looked at were not affected by diet. A number of studies have found that vegetarians are a bit slimmer, but not hugely slimmer. One survey carried out in 2005 found their average BMI was 22.1 compared to 24.6. So does the lack of clear evidence that meat eating is either beneficial or harmful stop any arguments? Does it heck! I can remember one person putting it to me that human development was a result of meat eating and that hunting was what made us into the species we are today. He did this so aggressively that I almost expected him to instantly sprint out the room in pursuit of a woolly mammoth, possibly hitting me on the way out for my stupidity in suggesting the meat eating wasn’t necessary for good health. So when the Beauty Brains suggested a guest post asking if eating meat affects your skin I was instantly interested. The Beauty Brains had picked up on some advice given by the highly respected Mayo clinic. Someone asked what they should eat to have a healthy skin. The advice given was pretty straight forward – just advising a healthy diet, but interestingly suggesting avoiding meat. Menacing meat? So is there any evidence that eating meat affects the skin? There are very few pieces of the jigsaw that have come to light so far. What effect does diet have on skin diseases? Diet has never been shown unambiguously to cause or exacerbate acne. I have my own thoughts on this, but there is definitely no established link between meat eating and acne and the debate is centred on carbohydrates and dairy products. Psoriasis on the other hand does seem to be affected by diet to some extent and a vegetarian diet does seem to be beneficial to psoriasis sufferers. Why this should be isn’t yet known. Scientists interested in prostate cancer investigated the effect of meat in the diet on the levels of sex hormones in the blood stream. It turned out that cutting out meat and replacing it with tofu slightly lowered the level of testosterone. Sex hormones can affect skin condition, so this gives us a possible link. But intriguing as this paper is, it gives almost no indication what it implies. The Beauty Brains bottom line So basically, I cannot find any real evidence that eating meat is harmful to the skin, but there is a slight hint that it might have some adverse effects. So what do I think? My feeling is that we will never find a link between meat eating and poor skin. At the end of the day meat isn’t that big a deal from a nutritional point of view. It might have a bit more protein and fat than vegetables do, but there isn’t anything much that you can get from meat that you can’t get elsewhere. My bet is that you can eat a normal amount of meat without it making your skin any worse.

"The Beauty Brains","","Are natural cleansers better for your hair? by The Beauty Brains Starrynight wants to know: I read in Marie Claire that shampoos formulated with natural cleansers like Aveda, Phyto and Ojon are better for your hair than other brands. What do you say about that? The Right Brain responds: Here’s a quote from the article Starry mentions… “All shampoos contain cleansers,” explains Christyn Nawrot, a regional educator for Phyto. But those with naturally derived cleansers are less apt to rob your hair of vital oils. (Phyto, Lavett & Chin, Ojon and Aveda use natural cleansers in all of their shampoos.)” Hoo boy! This is the kind of question the Beauty Brains just love because natural is one of the buzz words in this industry that doesn’t mean very much. Let’s take a look at the “natural” cleansers in the products mentioned in the Marie Claire article. (To make it easy, we’re just listing the cleansers, but you can look at the entire ingredient list at drugstore.com ): Aveda (Rosemary Mint shampoo) Sodium Coco-Sulfate (as known as Sodium Lauryl Sulfate or Laureth Sulfate); Lauramidopropyl Betaine (essentially same as cocamidopropyl betaine); Cocamidopropylamine Oxide Phyto (Phytocitrus Shampoo) Sodium Laureth Sulfate; Coco Betaine (same as cocamidopropyl betaine) Ojon Ultra Hydrating Shampoo Magnesium Laureth Sulfate (same base molecule as Sodium Laureth Sulfate); Cocamidopropyl Betaine; Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate; Lauryl Glucoside; Glyceryl Oleate Now let’s look at a product with “non-natural” cleansers: Pantene (Smooth and Sleek) Ammonium Laureth Sulfate; Ammonium Lauryl Sulfate; Cocamide MEA Yes, there are a lot of chemical names here, but you don’t have to be a scientist to recognize that all of these products have either “sulfate” type of cleansers , “betaine” type of cleansers, or some combination. These cleansers can be derived from coconut oil , so in that sense they are “natural” but as you can see, the very expensive “natural” products and the less expensive “regular” products basically use the same types of cleansers! The Beauty Brains bottom line We’re not saying there is NO difference between shampoo formulas. The amount of cleansers in the formula and the conditioning ingredients they are blended with can make a tremendous difference. So, we’re not saying any of these products are better or worse than any of the others. (Try them for yourself to find out!) But what we are saying is (and here’s the important part:) None of these products are more NATURAL than the others. That’s the true science! Buy what ever brand you like, but if you’re buying these brands because the company tells you that they are more natural, then you’re being mislead. We hope this helps! What do YOU think? Have you used any “natural” shampoos that you really like?

"The Beauty Brains","2017-08-04 17:02:00","Exfoliation Nation – Can you peel too much? by The Beauty Brains SMG Writes…I am a scientist, and would like to know the truth about the face creams that say they are rejuvenating because they remove dead cells and stimulate the new cell layers underneath to divide. This sounds downright dangerous- I was taught that skin cells only have a finite number of divisions they can undergo (natural aging) so if you use them up sooner – does this mean no skin for the last 20 years of your life? And stimulating cells to divide is one step in making cells into cancer cells. Aren’t dermatologists concerned? Left Brian’s Exfoliating Elucidation SMG, you raise some interesting questions. It took a lot of time scouring the scientific journals but we’ve finally found some answers. First, face creams that say they are rejuvenating don’t really have to do anything. Rejuvenating is one of those words that don’t really mean anything but sound like they do. A lot like hypoallergenic. See this post on cosmetic claims for more on these kinds of claims. And you remove dead cells just by rubbing and washing your face. Any facial wash will remove dead cells. Cosmetic Claims The claim of “stimulating new cells underneath to divide” is a bit different. If you look at the claims from products like St. Ives Apricot Scrub or Aveeno Skin Brightening Daily Scrub , they never mention anything about stimulating new cell growth. In fact, a search at drugstore.com of at least 30 exfoliating products showed that none of them actually claimed to stimulate growth of cell layers underneath. This is an implied claim but not one that anyone is actually making. And for good reason because if they did, the product would be considered a drug and would be subject to FDA regulations (at least in the United States). Mass market products don`t like these kinds of regulations. Exfoliating products like St. Ives contain little pieces of walnut shells (or some other particle) that create extra physical abrasion on the skin and pull away the superficial top layer. No need to worry about these. I even rather enjoy using these every so often. They really dazzle my dendrites. Chemical Peels The types of products that can actually affect the growth of cells underneath are chemical peels. These products have ingredients in them that actually take off the top layer of skin. Actually, they take off a little more than just the top layer. Ouch. Since dermatologists are the ones prescribing chemical peels for exfoliation, it doesn’t seem like they are too concerned. And if the “experts” believe it can be done in a safe way, who is this brain to say different. Although, note that they do a procedure under controlled conditions. When you buy an over the counter product, things like dosage and application aren’t as controlled. There are three types of chemical peel available including Alpha hydroxyl acid (AHA), Trichloracetic acid (TCA), and Phenol peels. Of these, AHAs are the mildest and also the only ones you can get in your local grocery or drug store. These AHA products have been around for a while and although the FDA has warned people that they might cause sensitivity to sun exposure, there haven’t been many problems reported beyond minor irritation. Look at this article if you would like to know more about chemical peels . As to your question about using up your skin cells. While it is true that skin cells have a limited number of times they will divide, it is also true that you have within yourself adult stem cells that will create new skin cells. That ensures that no matter how old you get, you will always have some skin. Beauty Brain’s Bottom line: Chemical peels that remove skin cells and stimulate new growth are not dangerous but they can be irritating and should not be used too frequently. If you are using a product that contains AHAs, use it sparingly and watch your skin for signs of damage. If you see any, stop using it and accept your wrinkled body wrapper. We’re all going to get old someday. And SMG, congratulations on your pursuit of a science career. The world definitely needs more scientists.","Exfoliation Nation – Can you peel too much?","b3b2f4255884ecb5d2cfa91f501ba3eb20054f9b","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2009/01/exfoliation-nation-can-you-peel-too-much/"
"The Beauty Brains","2016-09-29 14:03:00","Beauty q a does heat protection help hair? by The Beauty Brains Another Anon Asks… Hey, I just discovered this site and I consider it to be really interesting, so I just wanted to know, is it really true that heat activated/thermo protector products actually protect hair from heat? PS: I love this site keep up the good work! The Right Brain Blushes: Thanks for being a fan, Anon. Here’s your answer along with a little background on heat and hair: Heat on Hair Heat from styling appliances damages hair in a three ways. First, heat can weaken and destroy the proteins that hair is composed of. Second, heat can disrupt the natural oils in hair that help hold it together. Third, heat can dry out hair by boiling off internal moisture. After this kind of heat exposure hair can be damaged much more easily which leads to split and broken hairs. Hair Heat Protection? Can heat activated/heat protectant products really help? First, you have to understand that these terms don’t mean the same thing. Heat activated is more of a marketing term that doesn’t really mean much. It just means that the ingredients in the formula do “something” different when exposed to heat. Fragrance, for example, can be encapsulated so that it releases when exposed to heat. Styling products can be heat activated because certain polymers they contain melt and spread better when heat is applied. So, just because a product is heat activated doesn’t mean it offers heat protection. Heat protection, on the other hand, is a “real claim” or at least as real as a hair care claim can be. Heat protection products work by coating the hair and lubricating it during heat styling. This conditioning effect reduces the amount of damage caused by blowdryers, curling irons and flat irons. The good news is that any product that conditions your hair during heat styling will help protect it. You don’t necessarily have to buy a special product. The Brains’ Bottom Line : If you’re exposing your hair to heat you need to use a product to protect it. Conditioning your hair before styling will help and so will using a spray or mousse in your hair during styling.","Beauty q a does heat protection help hair?","7757ec90daccce69b44f05c55b188625d7c4f196","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2008/11/beauty-q-a-does-heat-protection-help-hair/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Imedeen Science Re-Evaluated: It works? by The Beauty Brains Left Brain Reflects… Last week, the Beauty Brains published a piece about Imedeen and whether a food supplement could actually improve your skin’s condition. Our conclusion…maybe it helps a little, but it hardly seems worth the cost. Then Kai, one of our Beauty Brains community members, asked us about a study that was published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition . She asks, what we think of this data. Imedeen Clinical Study The study Kai references is interesting. In it, post-menopausal women were given Imedeen Prime Renewal or a placebo over a 6-month period. Their skin was graded at various times by professional evaluators. The most significant part of the study design was that it was a double-blinded, placebo controlled study. Double-blinded just means that neither the people getting the treatment, nor the people evaluating the participants knew who got the placebo or who got the Imedeen. This double-blinded nature of the studies is typically missing in similar studies like this. The study was conducted by Stephens and Associates, a respected, independent testing company for the cosmetic and medical industries. Imedeen Study Results In this study, 38 women were given the Imedeen while 42 were given the placebo. 20 women had to drop out of the study for various reasons so their data is not included. According to the data, people taking the Imedeen were shown to have significantly improved skin (compared to the placebo) with less facial wrinkles, less sagging skin, less under eye dark circles, improved skin on the hands and a variety of other measures. Impressively, objective data taken through ultrasound measurements even showed significant differences. The authors conclude that after 6 months of taking 4 Imedeen Prime Renewal pills each day, skin in post-menopausal women is improved. Imedeen Theory. No matter what the data from a study shows, I always like to see what the authors think is the scientific rationale behind why something works. They say that Imedeen could work by modulating the balance of lipid inflammatory mediators. They site previous studies on some plant and fish oils that have also had this effect. The key elements of the Imedeen include a. Soy Extract b. Fish polysaccharides c. White tea extract d. Grape seed extract e. Tomato extract f. Vitamin C g. Vitamin E h. Zinc The reason Imedeen is supposed to work better on post-menopausal women is that the soy isoflavones in it may mimic the effects of estrogen in skin. If true, that sounds a little scary. Other things like tomato, grape seed, and white tea extract are supposed to work as anti-oxidants. Some Skepticism While this Imedeen study is good and gives some interesting results, consider the following concerns. 1. Small study : A study of 80 people is small and would not be used to make definitive claims. A pharmaceutical company would require a much larger group (300 – 3000 or more). 2. Publication bias : There’s a reason that sponsored research almost always produces positive results. If they have a bad result, they just don’t publish the results. I wonder, how many clinical studies did Imedeen do before publishing this one? And why didn’t they do a study on ALL women? (hint: they probably did). 3. No comparison : While the study was a double-blinded one, it didn’t compare the Imedeen treatment to topical treatments. Maybe those work better for less money. This is what people really want to know! Is Imedeen worth it? That last point is the biggest remaining question. Will Imedeen supplements work better than daily use of a good skin moisturizing treatment? While I have no data, I suspect the answer is no. Daily skin moisturizing treatments are proven to work and do so much quicker than the 6-months required for Imedeen to work. Beauty Brains Bottom Line While I was extremely skeptical about Imedeen having any benefit, their work in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition is a legitimate study, done by legitimate researchers, published in a legitimate journal. Kudos to the folks at Imedeen for their thoroughness. They’ve done much more than any food supplement company I’ve ever seen. However, I remain skeptical that $500 for a 6-month supply is worth the money. And I’m still concerned that the food supplement industry is not regulated so they can sell you anything they want and call it Imedeen. But you might find these results compelling. Feel free to try Imedeen Prime Renewal for a little while and let us know your results.","Imedeen Science Re-Evaluated: It works?","104c690e147deb12e3817c4656cdb69d271c3b0b","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2008/10/imedeen-science-re-evaluated-it-works/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Can skin be oily and dry at the same time? by The Beauty Brains Dawn wants to know… Hello Beauty Brains ! I’ve been hearing this a lot on my local media recently, Even though you may have oily skin, it could actually be very dry underneath. Thus, you should use a moisturizer to keep your skin hydrated. Is it actually true that oily skin could be dry underneath? Say I live in a tropical climate, is it necessary to still use a moisturizer if I have oily skin? The Right Brain Explains Her Skin Type: While skin is not “oily on top and dry underneath,” it is true that even oily skin can need moisture. Let us explain: Dry skin occurs when skin is lacking water, or moisture. A healthy amount of oil in the skin helps prevent water from evaporating (by reducing Trans Epidermal Water Loss or TEWL .) So, since oil helps keep water in locked in the skin, oily skinned individuals tend not to have dry skin. However, there are plenty of situations where even oily skin can become dry and irritated. This is much more common in cold, dry climates. If you live in the tropics and you have oily skin you probably don’t need a moisturizer. But if you someplace with a long, dry winter, chances are your oily skin may need a little moisture boost. The trick is to not over-moisturize oily skin or you’ll end up feeling greasy.

"Perry Romanowski","","Do salon shampoos have better pH? by Perry Romanowski Health Products Guru writes: I can tell you that without a doubt there is a huge difference in the quality of most and I say most shampoos that salon versus the drug store level. My own hair and scalp issues are the proof of this. The pH of grocery store shampoos is too high 99% of the time. The Left Brain responds: I respect your preference for salon shampoos, if you want to spend your money that way thats your choice. But your supposition that the pH of mass market brands is higher 99% of the time is simply false. But before I prove why, let me explain about the pH of shampoos. What is a good pH? Shampoos tend to be fairly neutral so they fall around the middle of the scale between 5 and 8. Shampoos that contain cationic conditioning agents are generally formulated a little lower and deep cleansing shampoos designed to get rid of styling residue are formulated at slightly higher pH to neutralize styling resins. But overall you should expect your shampoo to have a pH between 5 and 7. Are salon shampoos different? Salon shampoos do not employ any special technology that makes their pH different from mass market products This is not a matter of opinion, it is a fact that I easily verified. I took samples of ten different shampoos, some from salons and some from grocery stores and then I measured their pH using a standard laboratory pH meter. Here’s what I found: Grocery Store Brands (Average pH = 5.95) Dove Intense Moisture = 6.05 Fructis Moisture Works = 6.64 Herbal Essences Hello Hydration = 6.20 Tresemme Antibreakage = 5.40 White Rain Extra Body = 5.35 Yes To Carrots = 6.07 Salon Brands (Average pH = 6.14) Matrix Amplify = 6.76 Redken All-Soft = 5.59 Samy Salon Systems Smooth and Shine = 6.08 The Beauty Brains bottom line As you can see from this data the premise that 99% of all grocery store shampoos have a higher pH is simply not true. In fact in the samples I measured the salon products had the highest pH. The pH will vary by brand and doesn’t depend on where you buy it. What do you think? Do you buy salon products because you like the way they feel on your hair or because of some sciencey sounding nonsense that you’ve been told? Leave a comment for the rest of the Beauty Brains community.","Do salon shampoos have better pH?","0b15d3bc7ec2d51c2ee2ede1372e9d86478c9037","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2008/08/do-salon-shampoos-have-better-ph/"
"The Beauty Brains","","What are Safe Synthetics in Cosmetics? by The Beauty Brains Heather Hopes the Brains Can Help. Hi there. I’m a big fan of Lush products and the company’s responsible philosophy, but I have to wonder what exactly do they mean by “safe synthetics”? Are they non-toxic to humans, the environment, both? I’ve found conflicting information about the toxicity of ingredients like Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (which Lush would call a “safe synthetic”) et al., and I’d love to know once and for all what’s safe and what’s not. Thanks! The Right Brain Replies Thanks so much for your question. Unfortunately, the answer is not simple and depends mostly on your perspective. Chemical Phobic If you are the type that is naturally afraid of chemicals then you won’t believe there are any “safe” synthetics. People like this believe that the best things come from nature and when we start modifying them, we make them less safe. This is an extremist attitude but not one that is easily debated. The truth is, it is impossible to “prove” that any chemical is safe. In science, you can’t “prove” a negative (e.g that a chemical won’t be dangerous). But this doesn’t only apply to synthetics. You can’t even prove WATER is safe. And for some people, WATER isn’t safe . In the cosmetic industry what happens is that raw materials (whether synthetic or natural) are tested for safety following validated protocols. If the raw material passes these tests than manufacturers & governments feel confident to say that it is safe. This doesn’t guarantee safety, but it does help weed out the chemicals that will cause immediate harm. Chemical Fearless Another type of person are those who don’t think about their chemical exposure at all. These people will use any cosmetic or personal care product no matter what’s in there. It’s all about product performance. They trust that the government, industry, and industry watchdog groups are doing their jobs and protecting people from problems. This is not an unreasonable position to take because for the most part, people have used cosmetics in the US for decades with minimal incidences of problems. Some might disagree with this position and would suggest that there have been problems that we just haven’t seen yet, but there is little proof supporting these connections. However, this position is extreme too. We are all genetically different and will react differently to different compounds. A chemical that is perfectly fine for Sarah Bellum might be horribly irritating to your skin. Reviewing cosmetic ingredient lists can keep you aware of things to avoid. Chemical Quizzical Most people fall in between the two examples listed above. What often happens is they will hear a sensationalized story about a raw material in the news media or on the Internet and become concerned. When your well-meaning mom sends you an email telling you that SLS causes cancer or Propylene Glycol causes brain damage, it can make even the most caviler chemist nervous. And because there is a rampant chemophobia in our society, people readily believe what they’ve read and don’t investigate further. If they investigated more from reliable sources, they would find that claims of danger are more ambiguous than they’ve heard. Consider also that the media only reports news that is scary. Who would be interested in (or even believe) a story like “Lauramide DEA Shown Most Likely To Be Harmless”? What would watchdog groups like the Environmental Working Group do if they couldn’t find anything scary about the chemicals in your cosmetics? Both have to exaggerate conclusions of the science just to preserve their own existence. Safe Synthetics In the United States, the FDA requires that all consumer product manufacturers sell only safe products. They must do the appropriate safety testing or face recalls, financial penalties, and litigation. The industry trade group, the PCPC , sets guidelines that legitimate companies follow to help ensure that ALL of the chemicals (whether synthetic or not) are safe. The Beauty Brains Bottom Line What are safe synthetics? Based on the best available science, all synthetic compounds used in cosmetics are “safe synthetics.” The Lush marketing department is taking liberty with the truth by implying that some synthetics used in cosmetics are not safe. This is unfortunate.","What are Safe Synthetics in Cosmetics?","c1be58967e64fb47fd6e32158602fc2ddb736cec","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2008/08/what-are-safe-synthetics-in-cosmetics/"
"The Beauty Brains","None","25 tips for building a better beauty blog by The Beauty Brains Since many members of the Beauty Brains community are bloggers themselves, we get a lot of questions about how to run a blog. So for all of you beauty bloggers out there, here are our top 25 tips for building traffic and generally improving your blogs. (And if you found the post helpful, let us know with a link!) 1. Update often The difference between a “regular” web page and a blog is the frequency of updating and the amount of new content. If you’re really serious about blogging you should update your blog every day. This will also help with your search engine traffic. (More on that later.) 2. Produce high quality, original content There are hundreds of beauty blogs and everyone is reviewing products. If you are doing product reviews try to put a different spin on it. For example, since the Beauty Brains are scientists, we answer questions about how products work. Try to find someway to tie your career or hobby into the subject of beauty. If you’re into graphic design, maybe you could blog about packaging and graphics of cosmetics. If you like history, you could blog about beauty products of the past. Be creative! 3. Comment on other beauty blogs If you’re just getting started with your beauty blog, this is a crucial tip. You need to make the beauty community aware of you. Don’t be shy about asking for link love either. (Of course, don’t expect to always get it). And if you’re a longtime blogger it never hurts to remind the other bloggers or new bloggers that you are out there. 4. Sign up for Technorati It’s an Internet search engine and cataloging site for blogs that can help yours be more visible. It can also help you find blogs that cover similar subjects as yours. 5. Submit your stories to social networking sites like Digg and Reddit If you’ve got a good headline and your post gets voted up, you’ll see a lot of traffic. Blog software WordPress even has a plugin that lets your readers automatically submit your stories. We don’t recommend this as a primary way of building traffic but it’s nice to give your numbers a boost for the day. 6. Be a little controversial Don’t be afraid to take a stand on something unpopular. It could generate a lot of passion which means more comments. Sure, you might lose a few readers because you upset them, but more likely, you’ll spark participation in a debate. 7. Post comments on forums You’ll be amazed at the number of threads on the larger beauty forums. The Long Hair Community is one of the best. So is Makeup Alley . A good mention on sites like these can boost your traffic dramatically. Plus you’ll find other people with similar outlooks as you. 8. Use interesting graphics and label them Most of the beauty blogs have the same kinds of beauty pictures. Don’t be afraid to be a little different in your graphics choices, it will help you stand out from the pack. And, if you tag your graphics with names, people searching Google image can find your blog more easily – even if they were just looking for a picture! 9. Use a service like Hit Tail to help choose key words for your blog You can “own” certain search terms if you blog about them frequently. Hit Tail helps you find terms that people are searching for when they find your blog. 10. Think beyond beauty Women who read blogs about wine, or travel, or maternity clothes, or video games like beauty products too. Don’t forget that your readers have interests outside of beauty. That means you can build traffic by going to other kinds of blogs. 11. Be engaging Use contests or quizzes to keep your readers interested. WordPress has plugins for polls and contests; you can also find fun games to post at Blogthings.com 12. Reach out and touch your readers. Respond to as many emails and comments on your posts as possible. People take the time to contact you so you should take the time to respond. It really helps “build your blog community.” 13. Join a blogging network. You can meet some great people, get “swag” & deals for your reading audience and even get help with creating content. All of this can be yours just by signing up for a blogging network like Coutorture . 14. Keep a running list of new post ideas by using social networks like del.icio.us Everyone gets writer’s block once in a while, having a good list of tagged ideas on del.icio.us can be a huge help! When you find articles you like, bookmark the page and come back to it later. You can find stories using Digg, Reddit, and all sorts of beauty blogs. 15. Respond to your emails quickly. This is most important in the beginning when you’re hungry for attention and you don’t get that many emails. You should answer EVERY one, unless it’s spam. However, if your blog is successful, at some point you’ll get too many emails and you won’t be able to respond to them all. That’s the problem we face now! 16. Link to blogs and sites that you like. Tell them about it too. People love it when you talk about them. They may even start to talk about you. And this is great for blog traffic. 17. Learn about Search Engine Optimization (SEO) Even though you’re not a “techy” you should do some reading on SEO so you’ll understand what Google likes and doesn’t like about your site. One of the best sites is Aaron Wall’s SEO Book blog . 18. Grab readers attention quickly with a great headline. Here’s a link to one of our favorite posts on headline writing tips . One of the biggest problems we’ve seen at most beauty blogs is a lack of attention to the headline. There is so much to read on the internet that only good headlines are able to grab attention. Lists and “How To” posts always make great headlines. 19. Read metablogs (blogs that blog about blogging) You can get lots of good tips from sites like Problogger . 20. Create an About page Make it easy for people to learn who you are and why they should care. You’re unique just like everyone else. People want to know who their reading about. Also, consider including a picture on your front page. Blogs with a front page picture generally do better at keeping fans. 21. Make your posts easy to read. This means use short paragraphs, a readable font, and bulleted lists (like this one). Short blog posts generally work better than long ones. 22. Optimize your blog design When you first start out be sure to use one of the great, free themes or designs for your blog. But eventually, you may want to customize and monetize your blog. The layout of your columns, where you place your ads, and pieces of “hidden” code can all impact the effectiveness of your blog. Unless you’re a html expert, you’re probably going to need some professional help to fix all this. It’ll cost you, but we suggest working a company like The Blog Studio to help with your site design. 23. Create a Myspace and Facebook page for your blog This can be another effective way to build traffic. We’ve seen beauty blogs on Myspace with 10,000 friends! 24. Track your traffic You put so much time into your blog, don’t you want to know if anyone is reading it? Of course! There are lots of free options but the best ones are Google Analytics and Sitemeter . We’ve had the most success with these. 25. Keep at it! We’ve been blogging about beauty for just over a year and now we’re one of the “old timers.” Thousands of beauty blogs are started but abandoned after 5 or 6 months. It seems people just run out of things to write. If you can stick around longer than 6 months, you’ll have lots of fans who’ll want to tune in and see what you have to say everyday.","25 tips for building a better beauty blog","1c014353eb2babc8ed2cd4d075da3762ce0a0c9e","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2007/06/25-tips-for-building-a-better-beauty-blog/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Harmful Hair Care Habits by The Beauty Brains Rapunzel asks… I’ve read on this blog that the toxic chemicals used in cosmetics are not absorbed through your skin. But can dangerous chemicals be absorbed by the open hair follicles? The Left Brain replies: There has been considerable research showing that our skin is a good barrier to keep most chemicals out of our body. But hair has been largely overlooked as a potential pathway for toxins to enter our bodies. At least until now. Fearful for hair fibers A new study published in the New England Journal of Medicine entitled “Keratinous Fiber Wicking and Follicular Penetration” examines how 25 common hair care chemicals are absorbed by hair fibers like “microscopic straws” that draw the chemicals into the follicle where they can be dissolved in the bloodstream. Chemicals that were historically thought to be harmless because they are unable to penetrate skin have a much higher degree of bio-availablity when “sucked” into the scalp through porous hair fibers. According to the lead researcher, M. Weghosh, “…the medulla of the hair has an amplifying effect on the the potency of these chemicals. This study changes our entire world view on hair toxicology.” Please click this link to read the entire report so you can educate your friends and family about safe hair care products.","Harmful Hair Care Habits","c051c8db439d91c233a07efb641a7b745c2e3d77","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2010/04/harmful-hair-care-habits/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Is avon’s anew hiding hyaluronic acid? by The Beauty Brains Gracie asks about Anew …I am trying to decipher an ingredient list for Avon’s new product ” Anew Clinical Derma-Full X3 Facial Filling Serum.” It is described as ” injectable-grade hyaluronic acid — the same proven facial-filing ingredient injected by dermatologists–is now available in an at-home topical serum & cream.” The sodium hylauronate (hyaluronic acid ?) is 8th. After reading your “ How to read an ingredient list ” article, it doesn’t look like the hyaluronic acid is a main player in the ingredient list…unless it is disguised as another name? The Right Brain is high on hyaluronic acid: Hyaluronic Acid (and it’s neutralized form, sodium hyaluronate) is a highly effective moisturizer. It binds water to the skin when delivered from leave on products. Because this compound is so effective it doesn’t take a lot to be beneficial so the fact that it’s the 8th ingredient on the list doesn’t bother us all that much. There’s something else that bothers us a lot more! Arguing about Avon’s Anew Our gripe with this product is the statement you quoted above: ” injectable-grade hyaluronic acid — the same proven facial-filing ingredient injected by dermatologists–is now available in an at-home topical serum & cream” This claim implies that the hyaluronic acid in Anew delivers a similar benefit to an injection treatment. This is obviously not true. Injectable fillers plump up wrinkles from the inside out by filling them in with hyaluronic acid or other polymers. Topical creams and lotions have a superficial moisturizing but they do not penetrate the skin and do not have any long lasting effect on wrinkles. So Anew may be a very good moisturizer (which is important) but Avon should not be comparing their topical cream with hyaluronic acid to the injectable version as a ploy to get you to buy it. (As a side note, you may want to read this previous about injectable wrinkle fillers like Restylane causing arthritis .) The Beauty Brains bottom line Anew may be great for your skin but in our opinion Avon is presenting their product in a very misleading light. We think they could have much more honest (and just as compelling) if they had said something like the “Anew contains hyaluronic acid one of the most powerful, and most natural, moisturizing agents on the entire planet.” Shame on you Avon! Have you ever had injections to fill in wrinkles? Leave a comment and let the rest of the Beauty Brains community know if it worked better than wrinkle creams.","Is avon’s anew hiding hyaluronic acid?","39fbc877b492bd95824039d3d636c3bfa35ceb80","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2009/01/is-avons-anew-hiding-hyaluronic-acid/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Can anti-acne sticks actually make acne worse? by The Beauty Brains Sarah (no relation to Sarah Bellum) says: You guys are great– the Mythbusters of Makeup!! I’m concerned about my acne cover-up. The salicylic acid in Maybelline Pure Concealer is supposed to be good to banish zits, but are the other things that make it a waxy stick actually worsening my acne? Is a cream concealer better? Thank you! The Right Brain responds: Thanks for the kind words, Sarah. If the Left Brain wasn’t so afraid of getting sued, we probably would change our name to “Makeup Mythbusters.” But for now, you’re stuck with the Beauty Brains . You raised a good question about concealer sticks. Will all those heavy, waxy chemicals clog our pores? The answer lies in the acnegenic nature of the specific chemicals in the formula. Allow me to explain: Does the product claim to be non-comedogenic? First of all, read the label. The only way to tell FOR SURE if the product will cause acne is to test it, and if the company spent all that time and money on testing, they’ll most certainly put “non-comedogenic” on the label. (“Comedogenic” is the sciencey way to say “causes acne.”) Looking at Maybelline Pure Concealer we do NOT see this claim on the label so we have to assume it’s not tested. So now what do we do? We need to dig a little deeper. Does the product contain any comedogenic ingredients? The next approach is to see if any of the ingredients in your product cause acne. Each chemical used in a cosmetic can be tested individually for comedogencity, They are generally rated on a 5 point comedogenic scale: a 0 means non-comedogenic. 1 – 2 means slightly. 3 means moderate and 4 or 5 means zit city! So if you know where to look, you can check the ingredients listed on the label on the back of the pack to see if they cause acne. Let’s look at our Maybelline example again: Are there ingredients in the formula that are moderately or severly comedogenic? Here’s what’s in the product: Cyclopentasiloxane; Cetearyl Behenate; Laureth-2 Benzoate; Octyldodecanol; Synthetic Beeswax; Nylon-12; Tocopherol; Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride; Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Extract; Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract. May Contain: Titanium Dioxide; Iron Oxides; Mica. Active ingredient is salicylic acid. Checking some online lists of comedogenicity ratings we see that Octylodecanol and Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride can be “moderately” comedogenic. (Keep in mind there are literally thousands of ingredients and it’s impossible to find test data on every single one.) So does mean you shouldn’t use Pure Concealer? There’s one more question we need to ask. Does the product contain large amounts of those ingredients? Once you’ve identified that a product does have one or more comedogenic ingredients, you need to figure out how much of those ingredients are in the product. Low levels of acne causing chemicals may not cause breakouts at all. You can’t tell for sure without seeing the percentage of each ingredient in the formula, but you can make a pretty good guess if you know that in the US, cosmetics ingredients are listed in order of descending concentration above 1%. Below 1% they can be listed in any order. So if a couple ingredients with moderate to severe comegenicity scores show up on the first 5 or 6 ingredients in the formula, there may be cause for concern. Looking the ingredient list for Maybelline we see that Octyldodecanol is the 4th ingredient so it’s probably in the formula at a fairly high concentration. The Triglyceride is 8th ingredient, behind tocopherol (which is Vitamin E.) Vitamins are typically used at less than 1%, so we can assume that the Triglyceride is present at a fairly low level. The Beauty Brains bottom line What does this tell us about Maybelline Pure Concealer? It contains (at least) two comedogenic ingredients, one of which appears to be at a significant level in the formula. If you’re prone to breaking out, this may be a product to avoid. What do you think and sticks and zits? What are you favorite concealers?

"The Beauty Brains","","20 qualities of a questionable online skin care offer by The Beauty Brains Jocelyn wonders… Can your review Lifecell skin care? I’ve been looking around the Internet and this keeps popping up. I can’t tell if all the Internet “review” sites giving info on this product are fake and are actual sellers of the product. They make great claims based on user reviews. Love to hear what you have to say about it! Left Brain Lambastes the Long Sales Page: Ho boy. Get ready folks, this one will get bumpy! This product is a perfect demonstration of classic Internet, high pressure marketing. But first, a disclaimer. Disclaimer First, I have not personally tried Lifecell Skin Care products so can not vouch for their quality. Most likely they were created by an earnest cosmetic chemist who tried very hard to make the best products they possibly could. It’s also likely that they are made by a fine contract manufacturer who follows good manufacturing procedures and produces only high quality, safe products. If you choose to buy Lifecell Skin Care, you may be getting a perfectly fine product. But… You’re spending way more than you should. Let me explain. Skincare Products Work The truth is that almost ALL skin care products work. Even the least expensive ones will have the immediate effect of reducing the appearance of wrinkles, alleviating dry, red, itchy skin, moisturizing, etc. There are some products that feel less greasy, or some that work better for different skin types or some that might have longer lasting effects. But if you use a daily moisturizer, like the ones you can find at a grocery store, your skin will look better than if you use nothing. Nearly all skin moisturizing products work! This is good for consumers, but bad for marketers. Those marketers are left with few options as to how to get consumers (you) to buy their product instead of their competitors. Big companies with big advertising budgets buy commercials plus magazine & Internet ads. They sponsor TV shows, sporting events and even blogs just to remind you about them and convince you to buy their products. Little companies can’t afford these expenses and rely on Guerrilla Marketing tactics to get customers. Clearly, Lifecell Skin Care is one such company. Internet Marketing Trickery The website for Lifecell Skin Care is a textbook example of what Internet Marketers call the Long Sales Page. They use this tactic because it has proven time and time again to be effective in motivating people to buy products. Many legitimate companies use this approach (e.g. We have a page like this to get people to buy the Beauty Brains book.) But it is also the same tactic that online scammers use to get you to sign up for a monthly expense and make it near impossible to stop the service. I can’t tell which category Lifecell Skin Care falls into, but some claims in their website makes me skiddish. 20 Website Watchouts Here are 20 characteristics of websites that should make you nervous about spending your money. 1. Big red headline at the beginning. Red headline text throughout -If there is a huge red text headline taking up most of the page, you know you’ve found an Internet Long Sales Page. This headline makes unbelievable claims and is designed to get you to keep reading. The words are tested and retested until they are optimized to get the most clicks possible. 2. Highlighted text -Another characteristic of these websites is highlighted and bolded text throughout the page. These have been proven to catch your eye and make you more compelled to buy. Savvy technique but it has nothing to do with the quality of the product. 3. Signature -Personal signatures in websites make them look more legitimate. They are there only to manipulate you and get you to buy a product. It is simple to put a signature on a website so you do not give much meaning to it. It’s another online tactic that has proven to get people to buy more product. 4. PS, PPS, PPPS -You know a site is made by a professional Internet Marketing company when it has a PS or a PPS at the end. People are more likely to read this end making it an excellent way to end a long sales page. It’s indicative of good marketing but not of good product. 5. 100% Free trial -Free trials are a classic marketing tactic that works. But sometimes, a free trial isn’t really free. In the case of Lifecell you have to sign-up, get your free sample and then cancel your subscription. They make it complicated to stop because they know many people will just forget and pay for the free sample. If a company is really going to give you a free sample, they would just send you the sample with no obligation. Taking your credit card information and making you cancel before a certain time to get your money back is a marketing “trick”, it’s not a free sample. Be skeptical of these kinds of offers. 6. Full money back guarantee -This goes hand in hand with the 100% free trial. If you don’t like the product you’re supposed to be able to return it for your money back. Legitimate marketers know almost no one will do this. It’s the same as with coupons and rebates. Most people buy the product but forget to get the refund. Even fewer people will jump through the hoops to get their refund. Plus, some scammer companies, make it near impossible to get a refund causing many consumers to just give up. 7. Incredible promises -You know the old adage, if it’s too good to be true, it’s too good to be true? That true. NO SKIN CARE PRODUCT will work as well as cosmetic surgery. There haven’t been any “breakthroughs” in the cosmetic industry in years and nothing in recent publications promises to change that. The last “breakthrough” was AHAs and the jury is still out as to whether they are really useful with longterm use. Dithiolane-3-Pentanoic Acid, ubiquinone, Vitamin C, Deanol, and Acetyl Hexapeptide-3 are NOT breakthrough ingredients. And Lifecell Skin Care is not any more breakthrough than other skin care products. 8. Celebrity / Dermatologist endorsements -Names of celebrities are peppered throughout the Life Cell skin care website. Of course, they never say here that these people use the product, just that they belong to PETA who has certified that the product is 100% cruelty free. Big deal. So is almost everyone else’s products. Celebrities don’t know much about what skin care products work. Their inclusion on a website or in a commercial doesn’t prove much except that they were paid to say they like something. The same is true of dermatologist. Some doctors will take money to endorse any product. Don’t they make enough money being doctors? 9. Pictures of people’s faces throughout the site -Seeing people’s faces throughout a website has proven to make the sight seem more friendly and legitimate. It doesn’t have anything to do with how good the products are, but it makes people more likely to buy them. 10. Before and after photos -These are so simple to fabricate that they should never be used to make any judgements about whether something works. If you look at the before and after pictures on Lifecell Skin Care they often don’t even look like the same person. They might not be! But you’ll also see that the lighting is way off. It is not proof of anything! 11. Lots of testimonials (with faces) -Typically, these faces are attached to testimonials to make them more believable. But it’s simple to write-up a fake testimonial or higher someone to say they used a product and thought it was great. You should disregard testimonials as proof of anything. First, there is no way you can prove they are real. And second, just because a person thinks a product worked for them doesn’t mean it did. People often ascribe cause and effect at inappropriate times. Only double-blind studies can show whether something really works or not. There were no double-blind study data published on the Lifecell skincare website. 12. Video testimonials -Nowadays savvy marketers use video testimonials because they are even more compelling. Again, it is a simple matter to pay someone with cash or free product to get them to say whatever you want. These elements of a sales pitch are dubious at best. 13. Long….sales page -Early on in the direct marketing world people learned that the more words you write, the more product you sell. The Lifecell website with nearly 25,000 words is equivallent to a 100 page book. That’s just for one skin care product! It’s incredible. Unfortunately, it doesn’t mean the product is worth buying. 14. Anti-authority authority -The Lifecell site features a classic “anti-authority” who is supposed to be just like you. She accidentally stumbles on some secret being held by a scientist and turns it into a product. This is complete and total NONSENSE. A manipulative fairy tale designed to motivate you to buy the product. 15. Information being suppressed by evil corporations -As is often proven in political elections, one way to get people to pay attention to you is to point out the flaws in your competition. A common story by little companies is that big “evil” corporations are suppressing information from you. They want to sell you cheap products instead of ones that really fix the problem. This is complete BS! Companies that claim this are lying. Big skin care companies use top notch research and development people to create the best products available anywhere. They undergo the MOST RIGOROUS TESTING of any skin products anywhere. 16. Evil corporations are poisoning you -Another common theme is that big corporations use toxic chemicals because they are more profitable. This is COMPLETE NONSENSE! Cosmetic chemists are concerned with making safe, high quality products. They don’t try to poison the population. Some little companies can’t compete on quality so they make up stories to undercut their competition. 17. Lots of media mentions -Another classic marketing ploy is to show all the places that you are mentioned. Legitimate news organizations make a product seem more legitimate. Unfortunately, there is nothing to stop a company from putting up a logo and saying they were featured on NBC or CBS or wherever. Unless you see a real video, you should be skeptical. Additionally, being featured in the media means that they have a good publicist, not a good product. Being featured in the media means that they have a good publicist, not necessarily a good product. 18. Free additional give aways -Did you ever wonder why a company could give away hundreds of dollars of product for free? You should. Either the products aren’t worth the hundreds of dollars they say they are worth or you are overpaying for the product you are buying. 19. Pay for a monthly “subscription” -If a skin care product line requires you “subscribe” to them don’t buy it. You should buy product when you need it. Lifecell uses this “subscription” model so you should be cautious about buying it. Think about this. If their product worked as well as they say, wouldn’t you have better skin over time and need to use less product? That they continue to send you the same amount of product on the same schedule is suspicious. 20. Big money given to affiliates -Finally, the biggest red flag of any Internet Marketing company is an excellent affiliate program kickbacks that they give. Lifecell Skin Care gives their affiliates 100% of the first sale . Since the first sale is $189 that’s how much they pay any Internet publisher who converts a sale. If the Beauty Brains were part of their affiliate program (which certainly won’t happen after this post) we would be paid $189 when anyone came to our website and was convinced by us to buy Lifecell skin care. With a payout like that, some people will say ANYTHING to get you to buy. Therefore, you can’t trust any positive things being written about Lifecell. That means blog posts, blog comments, websites, and forum comments. The Internet is practically unregulated and people can say anything they want to convince you to buy. Don’t fall for it. Beauty Brains Bottom Line As I said in the begining Lifecell Skin Care products are probably fine products. But NO SKINCARE product in the world is worth $189 for a 40 day supply. Save money, go to your local grocery store and try a product like Dove or Olay. These will work as well or better and you won’t get roped into a subscription scheme. PS. Incidentally, some people have questioned the business practices of the company that makes Lifecell Skin Care . Do you have experience with Lifecell Skin Care? Is it worth the cost?

"The Beauty Brains","","Arbonne versus Mary Kay: Which one is more natural? by The Beauty Brains Sheri says.. .I have been researching home based businesses. I really want to get into skin care/make up products. I am currently using Mary Kay and I am now looking into Arbonne . Which skin care line is the most natural and healthy for my skin and what business do women tend to benefit from most..Mary Kay or Arbonne or another skin care line I’m unaware of??? I’m just confused with so much information out there. Any help/suggestions would be appreciated! Thanks! PS-I am all about being natural and using natural products. My current primary MD is a natural path doctor as well and I only take supplements at this time. I work at a nursing home and I see the effects of a stroke, heart attack, dementia and skin disorders/cancers. I want to be on the right track! Left Brain Loves MLM (not) : The most challenging part of this question was finding ingredient lists for either Arbonne and Mary Kay products. [UPDATE: Since this post was originally published in 2008, it has come to our attention that Argonne has added ingredient lists to their website.] You Beauty Brains in training should always be suspicious of companies that don’t make their ingredient lists easily available on their websites. Are they trying to hide something? Maybe not, but this is sloppy and irresponsible. Consumers have a right to know what they are putting on their bodies. Neither is Natural Trying to pick which is more natural, Arbonne or Mary Kay, is like trying to decide which feels harder, pudding or jello. There’s really not much difference and neither of them are natural anyway. After some searching (not easy), I found ingredient lists for products from both Arbonne and Mary Kay. First, Arbonne Tranforming Lift Formula. Water, PEG-20 almond glycerides, glycerin, butylene glycol, palmitoyl tetrapeptide-3, palmitoyl oligopeptide, chondrus crispus (carrageenan), xanthan gum, glucose, cellulose gum, cetyl hydroxyethylcellulose, lecithin, tocopheryl acetate, magnesium ascorbyl phosphate, retinyl palmitate, borago officinialis see oil, caprylic/capric triglyceride, ascorbyl palmitate, panthenol, stearamine, hydrolyzed soy protein, glycine soja (soybean) protein, ruscuc aculeatus root extract, triticum vulgare (wheat) germ extract, pisum sativum (pea) extract, sodium hyaluronate thioctic acid, lactic acid, sodium PCA, polyamino sugar condensate, urea, cucumis sativus (cucumber) fruit extract, betula alba leaf extract, trifolium pratense (clover) flower extract, symphytum officinale extract, nasturtium officinale extract, panax ginseng root extract, hypericum perforatum extract, carbomer, polysorbate 20, methylparaben, disodium EDTA, DMDM hydrantoin, diazolidinyl urea. While they have loaded their product up with things like wheat germ extract, pea extract, and clover flower this doesn’t make them “natural”. There is nothing natural about Carbomer, Disodium EDTA, Methylparaben, Butylene Glycol or DMDM Hydantoin. This formula would fail any good granola crunching green group’s standards. How about Mary Kay? Mary Kay product: Timewise 3-in-1 Cleanser Water, Mineral Oil, Glycerin, Isotheral, Neopentanoate, Bentonite, Cetyl Dimethicone Copolyol, Octyl Pelargonate, Neopentyl, Glycol Dioctanoate, Myristyl Myristate, PPg-26-Buteth-26, Sorbitol, Sucrose, Distearate, Peg-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Oleyl Oleate, Tocopherol, Comfrey Extract, Burdock Extract, Hops Extract, Yarrow Extract, Meadowsweet Extract, Hydrocotyl Extract, Coneflower, Extract, Camellia Sinensis Extract, Retinyl Palmitate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Triethanolamine, Sucrose Stearate, Butylene Glycol, Propylene Glycol, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Carbomer, Disodium EDTA, Diazolidinyl Urea, Carnauba Wax, Lactose, Methylparaben, Cellulose, Propylparaben, C9-15 Alkyl Phosphate, Phenoxyethanol, Lauramine Oxide, Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose, Titanium Dioxide, Ultra-marines, Chromium Hydroxide, Green FD&C Red 4, D&C Red 33. Natural? Forget about it. Only a natural newbie would be fooled by the greenwashing in this product. True green groupies would be aghast at the inclusion of Mineral oil and Propylene glycol in anything called natural. This is not to say that neither of these products are good. Both appear to be formulated with some of the best technology available. I haven’t tried them, but they are likely to be high quality, highly functional products. But they certainly aren’t better (or more natural) than something you can get at the grocery store like Olay. They also aren’t more “natural” than a store brand like Burt’s Bees although even Burt’s “naturalness” is debatable. Which Company Should You Work With? If you want to know which to work for, I’d encourage you to read other people’s experiences of working for both Arbonne and Mary Kay . Be wary of anyone who is too positive or too negative. My interpretation of these people’s experience is that it is tough to make money at either business. You have to buy your initial stock and then try to sell off all your product to get your money back. People do make money with both Arbonne and Mary Kay, but not many. They are both examples of Multi-level Marketing and these systems almost never make money for most hard-working sales people. Multi-level Marketing Scams For the most part, I find multi-level marketing (MLM) companies to be a bit of a scam. The good folks at Skeptoid explain the MLM problems nicely. Normally, a company pays you to sell for them. You get a salary or a commission and get compensated for your time. But in MLM companies, you have to pay the company for the privilege of selling for them. What a deal, not! And then you have to work hard to convert your friends and families into both customers and salespeople. Eventually, you will run out of people and your sales will stagnate and stop. Start Your Own Business If you are really interested in starting your own business, the first thing you should do is get the book Start Up Nation and head over to their excellent website . They provide all the steps you need to follow to get in business for yourself. My own suggestion is to start an online business because you can do all the work without leaving your house. Plus you don’t have to put up a huge investment as you do with companies like Arbonne or Mary Kay. And if you want to start your own cosmetic line, find yourself a good cosmetic chemist and maybe they’ll help you start your own line. Beauty Brains Bottom Line Neither Arbonne or Mary Kay are more natural than the other. They use standard chemicals that everyone else in the cosmetic industry uses. Their business model is tough to follow to make any real money. And if you’re looking for a home business opportunity, these companies may not be the best choice for you either. Do you have experience selling, buying, or using Arbonne or Mary Kay products?

"The Beauty Brains","","Tattoo Removal with Dermasal is Doubtful by The Beauty Brains Looking to get rid of a tattoo? – CLICK HERE Lynn longs to know …have you heard anything about a product called Dermasal for tattoo removal…..have you heard of one that works??? Left Brain lashes out : There’s something with tattoo removal lotions and creams that really bugs me. It must be all the wild promises on which they rarely deliver. They dupe you into dropping $100 or more for a product that has scant evidence of doing anything. I’ll get more into that later, but first a look at the science. Science and Tattoo Removal Creams A quick review of the recent medical literature on tattoo removal shows that the vast majority of research is being done on laser tattoo removal . Most experts agree that from a safety & efficacy standpoint, laser removal is the way to go. As far as tattoo removal creams go, not many peer reviewed ingredients have proven effective. One possibility is imiquimod. Six years ago, it was shown to be effective in removing tattoos from guinea pigs under controlled conditions. For various reasons, that work didn’t pan out, but scientists are still looking at it as a potential “helper” ingredient for laser tattoo removal. The US NIH is currently conducting a study and apparently recruiting volunteers. So right now, no topical ingredient has been proven to work by itself and the only thing on the horizon is a cream that might help in laser tattoo removal. Dubious Dermasal That brings us to Dermasal and my outrage. Now, I should preface this response by saying I have not tested Dermasal. I haven’t even gotten a sample of the product. But there is enough on the website that convinces me product performance is dubious. Look at these ridiculous claims. 1. “100% guaranteed tattoo removal system” – Nothing, short of surgery, is 100% guaranteed to remove a tattoo. And even laser surgery doesn’t always work. They extend this guarantee with a money-back offer. These savvy marketers know most people won’t return the product whether it works or not. It’s just too much trouble for most people to get their money back. 2. “specially formulated to remove or lighten your tattoos, no matter the color, the age, or the amount of ink used in the tattoo.” – Again, even with laser surgery you can’t do this. If the ink is old, dark, or deep enough, you might be stuck with it for life. 3. “the most effective at home tattoo removal method on the planet.” – In this case, their claim could be completely truthful. If no home tattoo removal system is effective, it’s simple to be best. 4. Dermasal ingredients have GRASE status by the FDA. – GRASE means “Generally recognized as safe and effective” But it doesn’t mean “effective” as in “effective for removing your tattoo.” It means effective as it’s safe and effective in a product you are going to eat. The implication that the FDA has approved this product is troubling. Of course, they provide no support for any claims made. Double-blinded study? Where are the results? What really burns me is you could save your money, get some laser removal treatments, and be satisfied. It does not cost that much. Beauty Brains Bottom Line While there’s nothing I can say to convince Right Brain to get that wrist heart tattoo removed, I hope the Beauty Brainiacs out there who have troubling tats don’t fall for fallacious fixes. You want to remove a tattoo? Save up for laser treatments. Incidentally, I’m not anti-tattoo. I love this collection of wonderful science tattoos . If you have tried a tattoo removal product, leave a comment below and let everyone know how it worked.","Tattoo Removal with Dermasal is Doubtful","2898c979b7ba313725b7663680ff2e83b75ed98d","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2008/11/tattoo-removal-with-dermasal-is-doubtful/"
"The Beauty Brains","","The scandalous secret beauty companies don’t want you to know by The Beauty Brains “Angel Dusting: The Marketing Devil Makes Them Do It” Part One of a Two Part Scatter Brain Expose I’m sorry to disappoint you, but this is not an expose on the illicit drug habits of advertising professionals though I’ll admit it is an interesting topic. Instead, I’ll trust you to know which ad copy was produced whilst someone was smoking something “funny”. But, all “funny” stuff aside, this is an expose? on one of the more scandalous marketing practices of some cosmetics companies known as angel dusting, fairy dusting or window dressing. Two Kinds of “Angel Dusting” Illegal drugs and storybook creatures aside, Angel Dusting is the practice of adding minuscule amounts of certain ingredients just so that they can be listed on the product label. Some companies use Angel Dusting in a harmless way just to get your attention. They try to entice you into buying the product by adding a touch of a popular and easily recognizable appealing ingredient. This type of Angel Dust ingredient is usually not functional, but it makes women feel good about the product because they find the ingredient attractive. Other less reputable companies abuse this practice by deliberately misleading consumers. They claim to be using a functional ingredient, but they don’t add enough to be truly functional. Deliberately misleading Let’s say that ingredient X is the wonder of the age and really does reduce fine lines and wrinkles; not just the “appearance” of fine lines and wrinkles. However, ingredient X costs $100 per ounce and it takes ½ ounce to actually work its magic. Cosmetic Company Y figures that they can add just a smidgen of ingredient X to legitimately list it on the label, charge a lower price but still make a huge profit because the predominant ingredient in their product is distilled water. Now, because ingredient X is listed on the label, Company Y will sell this product like hotcakes. Even so, the consumer has no idea that there isn’t enough ingredient X in this product to reduce an enlarged pore, much less a fine line or wrinkle. Creative marketing The other kind of “angel dusting” occurs when a cosmetics manufacturer adds a non-efficacious ingredient because research or perception has proven that consumers desire this ingredient even thought it basically does doodley squat. By the way, doodley squat is a big vocabulary word that means, “It doesn’t do a darn thing”. For example, let’s pretend that urban legend, folklore or an old wives’ tale has convinced you that smearing chocolate on your face will decrease the signs of aging. Your mom did it, your grandma did it and now you think you need to do it too. Scientists at the cosmetics company know for a fact that chocolate tastes great but it doesn’t do a thing for your skin, however they add chocolate to their face cream formula anyway because even though it’s an ineffective ingredient, consumer perception says otherwise. Of course, chocolate may very well be a wonderfully effective skin-care ingredient, I’m just using it as an example because frankly it’s something I’d love to smear on my face…especially around the mouth area. How to avoid being tricked Chocolate yumminess aside, how do you avoid paying for unnecessary ingredients in this scenario? Come back for part two of my Scatter Brain expose where I’ll discuss how to read ingredient labels so you don’t get tricked. Scatter Brain is a real-life copywriter for hire.

"The Beauty Brains","","La prairie platinum: the most over-priced skin cream in the world by The Beauty Brains Kristen’s curious: I just read about La Prairie Cellular Cream Platinum Rare. It is currently the most expensive skin cream on the planet at $1,000 for 1.5 ounces and is infused with Platinum. So Beauty Brains- what’s the REAL deal with this face cream? The Right Brain responds: The real deal is that La Prairie’s tiny, $1,000 jar of skin cream is worth every penny! Yeah, right. Medicinal Platinum Platinum is a precious, gray-white transition metal used in jewelry, dentistry, automobile emissions control devices and, apparently, La Prairie skin creams. Does platinum have ANY beneficial healing properties whatsoever? Yes, as a matter of fact it does. Complexes made with platinum, like cisplatin, are well known cancer treatments and somewhat less well known for their ability to treat skin diseases that involve accelerated cell growth. Some studies even indicate that platinum complexes can be helpful in treating rheumatoid arthritis and certain allergic diseases. So in a medical context, platinum is a powerful ally in the fight against disease. Pretty Platinum So does this magic metal do anything in cosmetics? We tried to find out what La Prairie had to say about their Cellular Cream Platinum Rare, but their website is woefully lacking in specific information. Here’s what they have to say: The most precious metal on earth now empowers your most precious asset: your skin. Modern science has shown platinum to be not only one of the rarest elements on earth, but most astonishing in its abilities: impervious to time, incapable of being oxidized by air, so precious, all of it that has ever been mined could fit in a single room. When La Prairie scientists discovered that platinum had the incredible ability to bond with human skin, they knew the implications were tremendous. La Prairie’s distillation of the rarefied powers and pleasures of platinum into an extravagant anti-aging masterpiece is the most exciting advance in skin science of this decade. The result is Cellular Cream Platinum Rare, a skin-transforming formula that recharges the skin’s electrical balance with pure platinum to ensure ageless performance, protects the skin’s DNA, and replenishes moisture continuously for a look of soft splendor. This is pure science at its best, offering unparalleled benefits; quite simply, the skin looks, feels and moves like younger skin. While we don’t doubt that this cream can “replenish moisture” we’re very skeptical about the rest of their claims. Especially since we could find no reference in the technical literature to cosmetic benefits from topical application of platinum. Aside from the the medical applications mentioned above, all we could find was an article in W magazine written by Jane Larkworthy that featured several quotes by Jacqueline Hill, the chemist who worked on this product. According to Ms. Hill “The skin has an ionic buffer zone that holds in moisture while protecting against free radicals and other damaging forces…. When the balance between negative and positive is out of whack due to exposure to pollution, sun damage or stress, the buffer can’t do its job properly, leaving skin both dry and more vulnerable. Platinum re-established a good electrolyte balance, improving moisturization and helping protect the skin.” We don’t doubt that the Platinum product can improve the moisture level of skin (since ANY skin cream will do that). But we’re disappointed by the lack of evidence that platinum metal can have this effect. And we’re not the only ones who aren’t convinced that platinum is worth a pretty penny when it comes to skin care. Ms Larkworthy also quotes New York dermatologist David Colbert who says “Although some precious metals are used in medicine as anti-inflammatories, they require large amounts to be effective, platinum is a very stable precious metal that can act as an antioxidant, but its use in a skin cream in nano amounts is unlikely to exert any visible effect on skin.” Requires large amounts, eh? Well since platinum currently costs about $1,500 per ounce La Prairie should raise their prices! The Beauty Brains bottom line Color us skeptical on this one – if La Prairie had really developed such an incredible breakthrough we’d expect to see some discussion in the technical literature on platinum. At the very least we’d expect evidence of patents in this space. Without any kind of evidence we’ll pass on La Prairie Platinum but, as always, we would be happy to review any technical literature that La Prairie would care to share with us on their behalf.

"Perry Romanowski","","Does technology make Arbonne products different by Perry Romanowski There are certain topics on the Beauty Brains that spark vigorous debate. Supporters provide a tenacious defense of their favorite products despite limited proof of effectiveness. Jan Marini and the eyelash growth product is one and Arbonne products are another. This post concerns the later. Recently, we received an email from Christine who is a self-proclaimed Arbonne representative. She is proud to report that she’s a true believer who has “drunk the Koolaid”. You can see all of her comments in our previous Arbonne post. She took issue with the fact that we suggested Arbonne products really weren’t much different than store brands. We’d like to respond to some points made in her comments because they are instructive in how to be a skeptical cosmetic consumer. What does it mean to research a topic? “I spent three years of law school learning how to learn, so I researched Arbonne quite thoroughly before deciding to jump in with both feet.” We hear this claim fairly often. People write in and explain how they’ve researched a product. Unfortunately, they rarely describe what was involved in this research. Did they go to the website and just read what was published by the marketing department of the company? Did they go to internet forums and see what people were posting about the products? Did they just read opinions on beauty blogs or hear something from their stylist? While these sources are helpful for product information, they are not really “research”. Each of these is full of biased opinions that may or may not be reliable. Real research is a combination of product information plus intimate knowledge of raw materials, familiarity with formulating techniques, and experience with numerous laboratory evaluation techniques. Ideally, there would even be peer reviewed research published in a journal like those found at PubMed. Here at the Beauty Brains we try to use our background in product formulation and sometimes even actual laboratory product evaluations to generate our opinions. Christine is correct to say that these are still just “subjective opinions” but unlike most, we have no products to sell you and we are not trying to convince ourselves we didn’t overpay for a product. Hopefully, this allows us to provide the most unbiased evaluations possible. Is the technology really different? The commenter makes the point that there are “THREE KEY THINGS” that make Arbonne different. Only one of these has to do with the product. The first thing is Arbonne’s technology, and the delivery system of the product. Most beauty products are made up of great ingredients – they can be the best on the market. However, they often do not penetrate directly to the epidermal cells that need the moisture the most. The do not self-adjust. Arbonne uses a technology called Nanosphere technology – look it up…The nanosphere technology takes the medication, or the product, in our case, directly to the cellular areas that need it the most. Arbonne’s moisturizers do not sit on the skin like most other brands do. The product not only penetrates down from the top epidermal level, but does its work where it is needed the most. Superior product? Not necessarily. Superior delivery? Definitely. It’s common for people to tell us that their technology is different. Arbonne’s “superior” technology is a thing they call Nanospheres. But this is the same type of technology that companies like L’Oreal and P&G have. This doesn’t make them different. And while nanosphere technology may sound superior to some, it scares many experts in the nanotechnology field. In the US, nanotechnology is unregulated even though it has the potential to cause unexpected harm. You don’t want your cosmetics to penetrate your skin! When they do, they can get into your body and potentially cause harm. Superior technology does not penetrate. At present, we recommend you avoid products that say they contain nanotechnology. Finally, despite the safety concerns of nanotechnology there is still no proof that Arbonne moisturizers, body washes or shampoos work any better than typical store brands. Could someone show us an independent side-by-side study comparing Arbonne moisturizers to Olay? The Beauty Brains bottom line There is no doubt that Arbonne produces a high quality product. However, we stand behind our original assessment that they are technologically not much different than brands you can get at the store. With the exception of sunscreen, we also suggest you avoid cosmetics that claim to have nanotechnology. In the future, we will do a more extensive post on nanotechnology.","Does technology make Arbonne products different","a9ac145bff5623f1b84326c6aad7a8fb99ada634","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2007/06/does-technology-make-arbonne-products-different/"
"The Beauty Brains","2016-08-03 18:27:00","Why does nail polish turn my nails yellow? by The Beauty Brains Sue says… I was wondering why wearing nail polish turns my nails yellow? Also, is there anything we can do to prevent that? The Right Brain’s polished response: It’s true, nail polish can turn your nails yellow. Why? There are a couple of reasons: Color reaction Some of the darker colored polishes can stain nails due to a chemical reaction between the colorant and the nail plate. This reaction is hard to predict because it doesn’t happen for everybody for every dark color. It can also take a few days to a few weeks to occur. Formaldehyde It’s also possible that formaldehyde (one of the ingredients in many nail polishes) is causing the problem. This chemical can react with the keratin protein in your nails and make it brittle and yellow. Medical issues Finally, if your nails are really yellowed and disfigured, you may have a nail infection or a more serious medical condition known as Yellow Nail Syndrome . So what can you do about it? Read on! Tips for non-yellowing nails: Don’t try to scrape off the stained area because it will damage and weaken the nail. Stay away from dark colors (which will greatly reduce your fashion options) Wear a base coat to protect your nails from staining (this makes sense to us) Look for nail polishes that don’t have formaldehyde on the ingredient list. (There’s no guarantee that this will work but hey, it beats this next tip we found from one of the nail polish companies from which is… Wear gloves (now there’s a practical idea!) Stop wearing polish and wait for your nails to grow out. (Also not too practical, this could take 4 to 6 months.) Soak your nails in 1/2 cup of water and juice of one lemon for up to 15 minutes, once a week, according to Sally Hanson. (We’re skeptical if this works but you can always add some sugar and just drink it as lemonade.) Buy only yellow shades of polish so you can’t tell if your nails are stained or not. (Sorry, just kidding on that one.) The Beauty Brains bottom Line: Nail polish can stain your nails yellow but by choosing the right shades, using a protective base coat, and drinking a lot of lemonade while wearing gloves, you should be able to control the problem.","Why does nail polish turn my nails yellow?","242ff4eb6769f56e3a69420255090890981a0f71","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2010/04/why-does-nail-polish-turn-my-nails-yellow/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Is votre vu for you? by The Beauty Brains Dagga91 wants to know… I am interested in becoming an independent consultant with a new skin care line called Votre Vu. I got samples and loved the product. I was hoping someone could shed some light on their products. The Left Brain is vehement about Votre Vu: Votre Vu is a French direct marketing company that offers a variety of skin and hair care products. Here’s a quick summary from NPROS.com: Vu brings spa quality french skin care products to the home party business. The Votre Vu motto is “stay pure, stay simple, work hard”. Launching in August, 2008, Votre Vu consultants will have the ability to run an inventory free business, direct customer orders via their personal web site, no monthly ordering requirements, and have all credit card transactions handled directly by Votre Vu. Consultants may also receive all weekly commission payments directly onto a personal debit card. As you know from previous posts on Arbonne and Mary Kay , I’m very cautious about working with direct marketing companies. But I’ll set that issue aside for the moment and focus on Votre Vu’s products. I looked at their website to learn more and didn’t find much to be impressed about in terms of their formulations. Votre Vu Sweep Eye Makeup Remover For example, look at their Sweep Gentle Eye Makeup Remover. The website gives a list of ”Power ingredients, the hard-working ingredients that make this product so powerful and beneficial for you.” For this product these Power Ingredients are identified as Isotonic Solute, Rose Water, Boric Acid, and Bluet Water. But a another click reveals that the rest of the ingredients in the formula include five or six different surfactants including our old friend sodium laureth sulfate. Now, I’m not saying that there’s anything wrong with using sodium laureth sulfate in an eye makeup remover, but there are number of cleansing chemicals that are milder and less likely to dry out your skin. If I’m paying $25 for 4 ounces of product, I’d expect to see a more premium formula. Votre Vu Cheveux Heureux Conditioner Riche I also looked at one of Votre Vu’s hair care products: the “Conditioner Riche.” It uses a pretty standard combination of fatty alcohols, stearamidopropyl dimethylamine, quats, and silicones. These are the same conditioning agents you’d find in a Pantene or Tresemme type of formula. Once again, there’s nothing wrong with these ingredients but $29 for a bottle of conditioner that doesn’t provide any additional functional difference seems a bit steep to me. Another note: the website proudly proclaims that this conditioner formula is SLS-free. This is amusing since SLS (aka sodium lauryl sulfate) is a foaming/cleansing agent and is rarely, if ever, used in conditioners! I’d feel much better about this line if they were attempting to honestly educate consumers instead of claiming confusing half-truths like this. The Beauty Brains bottom line I certainly can’t advise you on your business venture, Dagga91, but I’d have a hard time recommending Votre Vu formulas based on the information available on their website. I don’t hesitate to recommend trying expensive products if I see a potential technical benefit (like in the case of Living Proof No Frizz ) but I hate to see people pay too much for over-priced products that aren’t really that different. Having said that, I’m always open to new data that could change my mind. So if anyone has further information that explains the value of Votre Vu products, I’m glad to look at it and discuss it in a future blog post. Has anyone else tried Votre Vu? Leave a comment and share your experience with the rest of the Beauty Brains community.","Is votre vu for you?","ae87ee0700d6fc53c28f88f22f09c9a89e4babf1","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2009/01/is-votre-vu-for-you/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Top 10 female enhancement creams: do they work? by The Beauty Brains Diane dares to ask: I was wondering how effective these female enhancement creams really are. I looked at ingredients on 2 brands (Venus Touch and Orexia) and it looks like the only thing that might cause some sensations are the peppermint oil or menthol. What do you think? Sarah Bellum says: I’ve never had the need for these products so I’ve never paid much attention to them before. But, wow, once you starting looking, they’re everywhere! Some of them look like they use a simple “tingling” agent, like menthol, to get the job done. Others have different “active” ingredients that they claim will take you to “the promised land.” In either case, real test data for these products is tough to find. So after talking it over with the other lobes of the Beauty Brains, the Right Brain and I put together this list rating these products according to the following criteria: Active ingredients: What’s in the product that gives it a sexual sizzle? [Note: As you’ll see when you read this list, many of these products are based on L-Argenine, an amino acid that has been linked to the production of nitric oxide, a chemical that helps promote sensation down-you-know-where. However, these studies were done on L-Argenine in the blood, not from a topical application like these products provide. Therefore, we’re skeptical. Other ingredients like menthol and niacin cause a mild irritation that creates a tingling sensation.] Proof: What kind of data does the company present to back up their claims? Cost: Is the product a big rip off or little rip off? Ok, having said all that, let’s take a look at the top 10 female enhancement creams: 1. Alura Active Ingredients: L-arginine, Menthol Cost: $15 for 10 applications ($1.50 per use) Proof: None provided Worth trying? Nope. This one’s almost double the price of some of the others and doesn’t seem to offer any added benefit. 2. Climatique Active ingredients: L-Arginine, Niacin, and Menthol. We’ve talked about L-arg and Menthol above. Niacin can provide a topical sensation. Cost: $24.95 for 20 to 30 uses. (About $1.00 per use) Proof: According to the website: “Original Climatique was evaluated by the research department of world famous Institute for Advanced Study of Human Sexuality. Focus groups, clinicians and sexual scientists agreed with the women of all ages that Original Climatique deserved an unqualified recommendation for use as a sexual enhancer and a pleasure product.” Worth trying? Hard to tell. I’m not sure what this endorsement means and the niacin scares me a bit – maybe too much sensation if you know what I mean 3. Orexia Active ingredient: menthol Proof: None. Cost: $49 per jar of unknown size Worth trying? No way am I paying 50 bucks for menthol! 4. Senstra Active ingredient: L-Argenine Proof: Same as #1 and 2 above. Cost: $27.95 for 2 oz. Worth trying? Nothing compelling here. Keep scrolling. 5. Vazoplex Active ingredient: They won’t tell us! There’s nothing on the website that describes what’s actually in the product. A huge red flag! Proof: You’re kidding, right? They won’t even say what’s in it! Cost: $19.00 for a month supply. How many times would YOU use it in a month??? Worth trying? Forget it! 6. V Cream Active ingredient: L-argenine, menthol, Damiana, Maca, Ginseng, Ginkgo Biloba. Proof: None. Cost: $44.00 per jar of unknown size. Worth trying? More of the same. 7. Venus Touch Active ingredient: Arginine and Ornithine, more nitric acid stimulation via amino acids. Proof: Nothing substantial. Cost: $19.95 for 20 to 30 uses (<$1.00 per use) Worth trying? I’ll pass. 8. Vigel Active ingredient: L-Arginine Proof: There are references to clinical studies on L-Arginine but they don’t indicate how the L-Arginine was applied. Could have been ingested? Can’t tell for sure. Cost: $24.95 per bottle (approx. 30 applications) (< $1.00 per use) Worth trying? Well, at least it’s cheap! 9. Vigorelle Active ingredients: Damiana Leaf, Suma Root, Motherwort, Wild Yam, Ginkgo Biloba, Peppermint Leaf. (Peppermint has an effect similar to menthol.)Cost: $59.95 for 30 applications ($2 per use) Proof: None. Cost: $59.95 for 2 ounces Worth trying? No thanks, due to lack of proof and high price. 10. Zestra Active Ingredients: Borage Seed Oil, Evening Primrose Oil, Coleus Extract, Vitamin C, Vitamin E, and natural fragrance. Proof: Surprisingly, this is the only product that claims to NOT work through irritation. Unlike niacin and menthol, Zestra uses a different mechanism. Here’s what they say about their study results: “The Phase 3-type study evaluated the efficacy and safety of Zestra(R), compared to placebo oil in 256 women diagnosed with acquired mixed interest/desire/arousal/orgasm disorders in conditions of home use in conjunction with sexual activities. “Zestra was well-tolerated, and no serious adverse events (SAEs) were associated with study participants’ use of the product,” David M. Ferguson, PhD, MD, FACCP, the study’s clinical director, said.” Cost: $17 for 9 uses ($1.80 per use) Worth trying? Could be. Zestra is a bit more expensive per use, but it’s the only product that seems even remotely legitimate in my opinion. I’d bet my money on this one. The Beauty Brains bottom line: I’m not convinced there’s substantial research showing ANY of these really do anything beyond providing some surface tingling. But if you really want to try one, it looks like Zestra could be the best of the bunch. What do YOU think? Have you tried any of these? Would you? If you would, would you tell anyone? Let’s find out!

"The Beauty Brains","","10 things to do with cut hair instead of putting it in a landfill by The Beauty Brains The Beauty Brains are taking the day off. Enjoy this blast from the past post. You know when you get your hair cut and there’s just a pile of it left on the floor. Did you ever wonder what happens to it? In most cases, it’s just thrown in the trash but sometimes it’s used for other purposes. Here are some. 10 Uses For Human Hair 1. Wig making . This one is pretty obvious but it helps thousands of people each year to cope with losing their hair. A human hair wig looks natural and is incredibly durable. Most donated hair goes into wig making. 2. Test tress making . When cosmetic chemists design hair products they need to test them on the real thing. Companies like the De Meo Brothers or International Hair Importers provide tresses, weaves and mannequin heads all made of human hair. And if you were wondering how much hair is worth, 1 oz cost $40. That’s over $600 a pound! 3. Help people grow food . A company called SmartGrow uses imported human hair from China and India to make a gardening product. The hair is weaved into mats that help protect the plant’s roots from weather and insects. So, maybe it’s not the cook’s hair in your salad . 4. Clean-up Oil Spills . Some years ago NASA was testing a technique to use human hair to clean up ocean oil spills . No word on whether this made it out of the prototype stage. They should use my hair for this experiment because it is always oily! 5. Make clothes . Some people have weaved hair into a fabric and made clothes. Style dash recently reported on a dress made this way . And this barber has even made a hair bikini. While the dress looks good, I’m not sure I want to wear it or the hair bikini. 6. Create furniture . When you spend all day cutting people’s hair you have the strangest ideas. Here is an ex-assistant hairdresser who managed to create a chair out of human hair . The fiber is spun into a material like fiberglass and forged into the shape of a chair. Great idea but I wonder how long it would last . 7. Craft a work of art . It took 42,000 hair cuts, but artist Wenda Gu was able to create a giant banner using human hair . It was first displayed at Dartmouth College’s Baker-Berry Library. It’s no Mona Lisa but it is interesting . 8. Making soy sauce . As if you needed another reason to avoid things made in China. Here is a company that used human hair to make soy sauce . Since human hair is rich in protein, they were able to treat it, remove the amino acids, and pass it off as soybean oil. Wow, I didn’t really want to know that . 9. Nesting material . Birds will use almost anything to make nests and human hair is no exception. This bird watching site even suggests putting out bags of hair clippings to help birds make nests. Here’s someone who uses hair clippings to provide a nest for their pet rat . It’s nice when people help animals. I just hope they shampooed before cutting . 10. Crafting a rope . Native Americans were known to twist hair fibers together to make strong ropes. Eventually, they used horsehair but there are still people who practice the art. Not surprising. There are people who collect toenails too . If you are interested in seeing your hair go somewhere other than a landfill, consider donating it to one of these worthy causes .","10 things to do with cut hair instead of putting it in a landfill","5a9674f9b5bc179a675a07d5cfd39f199d0ab6db","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2008/12/10-things-to-do-with-cut-hair-instead-of-putting-it-in-a-landfill/"
"Randy Schueller","2014-08-18 14:21:00","What is the difference between soap surfactants? by Randy Schueller Mo wants to know… I’m confused. Since I read that surfactant-based liquid cleansers are better than soap, I have been on the look out for a good body wash preferably fragrance free. But now I discover that Dove Bar / Vanicream Bar etc. are not soap but Syndets. What does that mean? There are also Syndet base Liquid face & body washes. What do I pick up? Right Brain comes clean : It’s easy to understand why people get confused by terms like soap, surfactant and syndet. Personal care marketing companies often hijack words from science and repackage them as friendly marketing messages. Unfortunately, everyone’s marketing message is different so words lose their focused definitions. That’s what has happened with these words. We’ll try to clear it up – busting beauty myths like this is what we do best! Surfactant Cleaners Almost all cleansing products are based on surfactants . These molecules have a special construction which makes them compatible with both oils and water. Since oil and water do not usually mix, you need surfactants to remove oils from skin and hair. Soaps and syndets are all surfactants. Detergent is just a synonym for surfactant. Syndet Made Simple Syndet is a portmanteau word created by combining the words “synthetic” and “detergent”. It was made up by the beauty industry to make products based on synthetic detergents sound sciencey and special. Synthetic detergent sounds nasty, dangerous and icky. Syndet sounds high tech, fun and friendly. A common type of Syndet like Sodium Lauryl Sulfate is made by reacting a fatty alcohols with acid. Fatty Alcohol + Acid = Syndet Straight Dope on Soap Soaps were the first surfactants people used for cleaning. They are made by reacting fatty acids with a base (e.g. sodium hydroxide ), a process called saponification. Fatty Acid + Base = Soap Three things make Soap different from Syndets. 1. Starting material . The starting material for soap is either animal fat (tallow) or natural oils. Syndets start with fatty alcohols which can be distilled from petroleum or derived from natural oils. Sodium Lauryl Sulfate can be made from both Coconut Oil or petroleum distillates. A by-product of soap making is glycerin, a natural moisturizer. Syndets must be formulated with glycerin or other moisturizing ingredients. 2. Reactions with metal ions . The primary problem with soap is that it reacts with metal ions to form a material that is insoluble (can’t be dissolved) in water. This is what causes the “soap scum” you see lining people’s bathtubs and sinks. Syndets do not react like this so it is not a problem. 3. Formulating flexibility . From a formulation standpoint, syndets are much more flexible than soaps. Soaps are generally solids at room temperature and are limited in the number of ingredients you can incorporate in them. Syndets are liquids that can be thickened and made solid. Syndet Bar An example of a Syndet bar would be this La Roche-Posay Syndet bar . It uses standard surfactants like Disodium Cocoamphodiacetate, Coco-Betaine, Peg-7 Glyceryl Cocoate, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, etc. Beauty Brains Bottom Line As far as what you should get, that is up to you. If fragrance free is an issue, you could try the La Roche product. You could also try the Dove Bar or other syndet bar. The key to these things is to try different products until you find something you like. Everyone’s skin and preferences are different. Personal experimentation is your best option.

"The Beauty Brains","2016-05-09 17:18:00","Are animal cosmetic ingredients still used? by The Beauty Brains Nicola needs to know… Is it true that rendering plants sell animal by-products for use in cosmetics? Left Brain Illuminates: It has always amused me that people will gleefully eat steak, lobster, and fried chicken, but are appalled to imagine animal ingredients would be used in their cosmetics. What do they think should happen to the inedible parts that come from food production? Just be deposited in landfills and allowed to rot? I’m sincerely curious. Animal Ingredients in Cosmetics But enough of that. To answer your question, YES, it is true that there are still some animal ingredients used in cosmetics. Their use is not nearly as prevalent as fringe cosmetic companies like Arbonne would suggest, but they are still in there. For a big list of possible animal ingredients used in cosmetics, see this one put together by PETA . We’re not endorsing this list as gospel, but a brief review found it covered most ingredients you’d likely find. Of course, in true fashion of a fearmongering group, it also includes sketchy information including ingredients you won’t find anymore. Also, it lists animal-derived ingredients like Honey, Milk, and Lanolin without mentioning that these materials are gotten without harming animals. Major Cosmetic Animal Ingredients The truth is that most companies now go out of their way to avoid using animal ingredients. Any minor cost savings achieved by using animal based ingredients is vastly off-set by the PR nightmare generated by groups like PETA and EWG. Also, real governmental regulations about Mad Cow Disease (BSE) have prompted companies to mostly use alternatives. But you’ll still find some animal ingredients. The following are the most common. Collagen What is it? Collagen is a protein and the main component of connective tissue. This includes connective tissue in both humans and animals. It is also chemically modified to produce gelatin. Why is it in my cosmetic? Collagen is primarily used in skin wrinkle creams. The collagen in your skin is naturally degraded over time due to environmental factors. Add to that your body’s own tendency to slow collagen production as you get older and you start to getting sagging, wrinkly skin. The idea behind including collagen in your skin products is that by replacing damaged collagen you can firm up your skin and reduce wrinkles. Does it work? Collagen won’t much permanent effect on your wrinkles. At best, it will provide a temporary tightening of your skin. The idea of arbitrarily plopping collagen on your skin to fix wrinkles is like trying to fix a hole in your Lucky Jeans by dumping a pile of denim on it. It doesn’t work. See this article for what really works on wrinkles . Alternatives – Just because a product says it has collagen in it doesn’t mean that it is using animal derived collagen. There are plant derived alternatives. They are equally as ineffective. Elastin What is it? Elastin is another protein important in the proper functioning of your connective tissue. It is like a rubber band that allows skin, cartilage, tendons, etc. to snap back after being stretched. As you get older it gets diminished and your skin starts to sag. Why is it in my cosmetic? Elastin is used in skin products for the same reason as collagen. Cosmetic companies figure that if it’s in your skin naturally adding more must be good. Does it work? Topical elastin has never been shown in a peer reviewed study to have any long-term effect on wrinkles. It suffers from the same problems as collagen. When produced inside your body by your cells, it reduces wrinkles. When applied topically, it has minimal effect. It’s not only the ingredient that matters but how the ingredient is applied. Alternatives – Raw material suppliers have developed synthetic and non-animal versions of elastin. Keratin What is it? Keratin is another structural protein found in mammals. This is the stuff of hair, nails and horns. Why is it in my cosmetic? Human hair is composed of keratin. When you lose keratin protein your hair is damaged. Cosmetic companies figure if you can replace that keratin with more protein, then you’ll fix your hair problems. Does it work? While protein in general has been shown to provide some benefit when applied to hair, keratin protein in particular is not more effective than some other protein source. Applying protein to hair also suffers from the same like-on-like fallacy as collagen and elastin. More effective hair conditioning ingredients include quaternized surfactants and silicones. Alternatives – There are non-animal derived Kertain alternatives. Tallow What is it? Tallow is animal fat. It contains mostly longer chain fatty acids. Why is it in my cosmetic? Fatty acids and oils make excellent conditioning ingredients for both hair and skin products. They improve the feel and look of these surfaces. Does it work? Yes. Tallow derived ingredients actually will make your skin and hair feel better. But you can get these same fatty acids from plant oils like sunflower, soybean, etc. The animal derived ingredients don’t provide much added benefit. Alternatives – Soybean oil and other plant derived oils. Beauty Brains bottom line While there are ingredients used in cosmetics that come from animals, the industry has mostly moved to using suitable alternatives. There are few, if any, animal derived ingredients that don’t have some suitable, plant or synthetic replacement. Just looking at the ingredient list to determine if it has an animal ingredient is not going to tell you much. Synthetic collagen is not labeled any differently than animal-derived collagen. Do animal derived ingredients in your cosmetics bother you? What do you think should be done with the stuff left over from the food processing industry?

"The Beauty Brains","","How coconut oil saves lives by The Beauty Brains Rene’s interrogatory : In the past you guys had talked about coconut oil being one of the few oils that can actually penetrate your hair. How many oils are there that can penetrate hair and skin? And which one’s are the most stable? The Right Brain’s response: Thanks for your question, Rene. A lot of the Beauty Brains community is interested in coconut oil as a hair and skin care ingredient. Crazy about coconut oil We don’t have much new info on the subject, but the scientific study that we blogged about before did show that coconut oil, olive oil and avocado olive were the best at penetrating hair. The other oils studied did not have that ability. So if you’re looking to improve the strength of your hair those are good materials to consider. Skin penetration is a different issue because deep penetration is not necessary to provide moisturization. Stability of the oil itself is really a separate issue shouldn’t cause you much concern. If oils have unsaturated double bonds they can become unstable and turn rancid over time, but any properly formulated product will contain preservatives and antioxidants to keep the oil from going bad. But while we’re on the subject of coconut oil , your question gives us a good excuse to mention a recent article from Science Daily that describes how coconut oil is practically saving the lives of poor families in certain East African countries. These women live in areas that grow abundant coconuts, yet their emaciated families are so poor that they can barely get enough food to survive (see picture above.) Science to the rescue The exciting news is that student engineers from Brigham Young University have designed a new, low cost device that enables women to easily extract valuable oil from coconuts so they can help provide for their families. Now the villagers have an easy way to make their own oil and sell it locally or to exporters for use in beauty and cooking products. According to the report, the invention can help them earn ten times more money than they could make otherwise. This is really a heartwarming story which you can read for yourself . And once again, it’s another example of how cosmetic science makes our lives better! What do YOU think? Do you look for cosmetics that use ingredients that help support developing countries?","How coconut oil saves lives","610c76ca79ea5ae0e3c530a04d781c6e4074c0ce","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2008/08/how-coconut-oil-saves-lives/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Five ways to ruin your fingernails by The Beauty Brains Debby’s in Digit Danger: My fingernails go through seasonal cycles. Sometimes they are long, strong and healthy. At other times, like right now, they split and bend and look ragged. I’ve used Sally Hansen’s Maximum Growth, but it doesn’t seem to do much. Got any ideas? Also, why does Sally Hansen have so many products that all seem to do the same thing (i.e., Hard As Nails, Maximum Growth, etc.)? The Right Brain Hammers Out A Reply For Her Nails: It’s hard to say for sure what the seasonal changes are that you’re experiencing, but many things can affect the condition of your nails. Here’s our top 5 finger factors to avoid when your nails look hammered. 1. Excessive environmental dryness Are your nails worse in the winter? If your nail condition is literally changing with the seasons, it may be due to humidity. Nails, like skin, are subject to the drying effects of the environment. Solution: If your nails are dry and raggedy in the winter use more lotion. 2. Hyper hand washing Does your job (or hobby or home life) cause you to wash your hands on some occasions more than others? Washing your hands with soap and water can dry out nails. That could be causing an apparent seasonal change. Solution: Use a mild hand wash instead of bar soap and don’t skimp on the lotion. 3. Damage from drying solvents Are you engaged in any activities that would expose your nails to solvents? For example, home repair projects (like painting a room or varnishing wood trim) could be seasonal activites that negatively impact the condition of your nails. Solution: make your husband do it. (That’s a suggestion from Sarah.) 4. Negative nail product usage Do you occasionally use nail hardening products? Since you asked about several Sally Hansen products, I’m guessing you do. Those products do make nails harder but they can also make them brittle and more prone to breaking. That`s because they use a chemical called formaldehyde to cross link the keratin protein in nails. Solution: Skip the hardeners and see if it helps. (And to answer your question about why they have so many products that seem to do the same thing, we have one word: Capitalism.) 5. The horrible heartbreak of psoriasis Psoriasis is a disease that causes your skin to become red and scaly. About half the people who suffer from this condition also have nail problems, particularly pitting, rippling, and/or splitting of the nail. Unfortunately, there is no cure for psoriasis, so you’ll have to amputate the affected fingers. (Just kidding; I wanted to see if you were still reading.) Solution: If you think psoriasis might be responsible for your nail problems, check with a dermatologist for treatment options.","Five ways to ruin your fingernails","d3673edb6af3518c09fa443e67c465f0e2339a4f","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2007/05/five-ways-to-ruin-your-fingernails/"
"The Beauty Brains","None","Is aloe vera a good moisturizer? by The Beauty Brains NC Fiction’s fanciful question… I recently made a discovery after throwing out garbage bags full of old/useless products that all of the products that work for me contain aloe barbadensis . I have been searching for awhile now for a good moisturizer to no avail. I started using aloe vera on my skin to wipe my face at night and my skin became clearer and brighter! I read that Aloe Vera can be moisturizing though so my question, since Im tired of looking for a moisturizer, is this… Would using aloe vera on my face be considered more like a toner or anti-inflammatory or a moisturizer? Maybe both? If it is moisturizing, is it moisturizing enough to use for the rest of my 20s? The Right Brain’s response: We’ve written before that aloe actually works. However, the ingredient is not magical – it has to be delivered from the proper formulation, at the correct concentration, and then left on the skin for it to have a chance to have a positive effect. So be careful when you jump to the conclusion that the products that work for you all have aloe, therefore it must be the aloe that providing the benefit. There are other variables that you need to take into consideration. Not all aloe is equal Some skin moisturizers that use high levels of aloe are your best bet for having an effect. For example, Jason Natural Cosmetics Aloe Vera Super Gel is a likely candidate because it’s almost pure aloe vera and it’s left on the skin. Other the other hand Methods Foaming Hand Wash with Green Tea Aloe is unlikely to deliver any aloe benefit since there’s less in the formula and, more importantly, it’s rinsed away. You should also realize that while aloe can be good for your skin it doesn’t provide the kind of heavy duty moisturization benefits that your skin needs when it’s really dried out.","Is aloe vera a good moisturizer?","f5a0db737cafcf457060e96d12ec2e2615aa9b17","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2010/04/is-aloe-vera-a-good-moisturizer/"

"The Beauty Brains","None","Ten cosmetic products that really work by The Beauty Brains Kisha’s quandary: It depresses me to see your site be so negative, it seems like no product works out there and that we are so dependent on chemicals drugs and studies, which a lot of times are purposely rigged to have the drug companies make the most money. How in the word have we survived for so long without those drugs before???? The Left Brain’s reply: Kisha, as I’ve said before, our mission is to educate our community about the truth behind cosmetic products. And the sad truth is, there are many products out there that do NOT do what they promise. Bogus beauty buys Some examples include the Pink Patch , Collyre Bleu Eye Drops , Airborne , Kinoki Detox Foot Pads , the Brava Breast Enhancement system, Clarins 3P Screen Mist, and a host of high-priced, over-promised anti-aging products like Perricone . Many of the products that we’re asked about, like the ones I just mentioned, are dubious at best. I rarely see questions that have a clear cut, positive answer like “does Suave shampoo really get your hair clean.” So, since our community asks us about questionable products, the answers that the Right Brain and I give are often negative because many of these products are more about BS than beauty science. It’s unfortunate that you think it’s depressing to learn the truth about products that are trying to trick you. I think it’s much more depressing to wake up one morning and realize you spent a lot of your hard earned money on products that don’t deliver they benefit they promise. Cosmetics that really work However, just because we blog about a lot of bogus products, that doesn’t mean that NOTHING works. In fact, the world of cosmetics offers MANY products that are highly effective. The Right Brain and I have blogged about these in the past, but in case you haven’t seen them, here are 10 quick examples of cosmetics that really work: Crest Teeth whitening strips Secret Clinical Strength Antiperspirant Avocado oil for soothing skin Coconut and Palm oil hair strengthening products like Ojon Hair dyes of all kinds Silicone scar removal sheets Skin lighteners like Meladerm Fluoride tooth paste Skin moisturizers Hair relaxers The Beauty Brains bottom line In conclusion, I’m sorry that you feel our site is negative and depressing. But I’d rather tell you the straight truth about cosmetics and have you leave the Beauty Brains community than let you go on thinking that all the advertising you read about cosmetics is true. Hopefully you’ll continue reading so we can help you be a smarter shopper. Thanks for your question.","Ten cosmetic products that really work","d93ffe5d23f519e64f3a65eeb2c53bf8dbe8757f","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2008/05/ten-cosmetic-products-that-really-work/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Good makeup doesn’t have to be expensive by The Beauty Brains L. Cederkin Writes… What do you think about e.l.f. Cosmetics? They claim to use the same formulations as “name brand” products but because they don’t charge for marketing and packaging, their products are a lot cheaper. The Right Brain Writes Back: For those of you not familiar with e.l.f, it is NOT a North Pole based toy company owned by Will Ferrell. e.l.f. really stands for eyes, lips, and face and it’s a web-based cosmetics company that claims to use the same ingredients as the “major” brands. Can this be true? Sure, e.l.f. products may be formulated with the same basic ingredient technology as more expensive brands, but that’s not really the point. Beauty Brains bottom line As we Beauty Brains have said many times before, you can’t tell the quality of a cosmetic product from price alone. You can find very good cheap products and really crappy expensive products out there. If you like the quality of e.l.f. products and if you can find the shade of lipstick or eyeshadow that you like, then BUY it! There’s no reason to spend more if you’re satisfied with a product that only costs $1. But if you’ve decided that you can only go out in public wearing M.A.C.’s Vegas Volt lipstick ($12.50) or that you wouldn’t be caught dead without Girlactic’s Pink Glam Eye Powder ($14) then you go girl! There’s nothing wrong with spending more money on an expensive brand. It’s really a matter of your taste. Just realize that with the prestige products you may be paying more for brand name “sorcery” than functional science. What is your favorite inexpensive cosmetic brand? Leave a comment and let the rest of the Beauty Brains community know what products are a real deal.","Good makeup doesn’t have to be expensive","c26e8d929922ee8886590fe7b66d7c24553a027f","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2008/12/good-makeup-doesnt-have-to-be-expensive/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Is Imedeen good for my skin? by The Beauty Brains Cheong Asks: Do oral skin supplements like Imedeen really work?? I do believe that you are what you eat, and a healthy diet does help your skin, but can taking things like collagen or bird’s nest soup or ginseng really give you better skin?? The Left Brain Begets: Thanks for a great question. We get these kind all the time asking if various food supplements are going to help skin, hair, weight loss, and even longevity. There have even been some recent stories in which flax and borage oil boost skin health . Supplements are unregulated…that’s bad The claims on some of these things are so wild, it seems that just popping a pill everyday should fix every problem you’ve got. Of course, this is nonsense. Remember, food and health supplements are NOT REGULATED. They can say ANYTHING they want, even if it is a LIE, and no one will likely do anything about it. So, when it comes to supplements the first reaction for every Beauty Brainiac should be one of skepticism. The Imedeen story So, what about Imedeen? Imedeen is basically a skincare supplement that includes proteins, polysaccharides, vitamin C and other “free radical scavengers”. According to the company… Imedeen Time Perfection is state-of-the-art skincare based on natural ingredients that are scientifically documented to visibly reduce signs of aging from within and to help defend against new signs of aging from forming. And after just 2 to 3 months of use, you are supposed to SEE results. Hope in a bottle is finally here! Yeah, right. Although, in the event that you don’t notice anything after a month of use, they include this disclaimer… As with any nutritional supplement, the response will vary from person to person, and depends on skin condition, general health, diet, environment and other factors. Which basically means if it doesn’t work for you, then there must be something wrong with YOU. First, the notion that what you eat affects the condition of your skin may make sense but few, if any studies have shown any link between diet and skin conditions. Unless you are malnourished, there will not be any noticeable difference in your skin. It’s highly unlikely that using this supplement will have any noticeable effect. Imedeen makes strong claims with weak data Next, let’s look at some of their specific claims for this supplement. 1. Instantly begins to neutralise the skin-degrading processes 2. Significantly improves the skin’s moisture balance 3. Visibly reduces the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles 4. Diminishes visibility of dilated capillaries and age spots 5. Leaves the skin with a brighter, more youthful and even complexion 6. Helps shield and defend the vital structural elements of the skin against future degradation What do these claims really mean? 1. This doesn’t mean anything. “Instantly begins?” Why doesn’t it “Instantly neutralise”? And notice how they don’t spell out what the “skin-degrading processes” are? What could they possibly mean? They are hoping you’ll make up something that you believe is “skin-degrading” and believe that this stuff stops it. 2. This doesn’t mean anything either. What is the “skin’s moisture balance”? The only factors that can affect this are the environmental temperature and humidity, and your own level of hydration. 3, 4, and 5. Reduce fine lines and wrinkles? These claims come from their scientific data. But a study that they reference as proof clearly concludes that after 3 months there are “NO SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS detected.” It is only after 9 MORE MONTHS of an uncontrolled study that the Imedeen shows any effect. Unfortunately, with an uncontrolled study there is no way to tell what caused the positive results they saw. This is extremely weak data! 6. Again, this doesn’t mean anything. How do you prove that you “shield and defend” against future skin damage? You can’t! What a bunch of marketing gobbly gook. The most outrageous part of this supplement is how much it costs. According to our friends at beauty.com, a box of Imedeen contains 60 tablets (1 month of treatment) that cost $70. So , you’ll have to buy $210 worth of supplements to see any effect, if there is any effect. In fact, since their own study says it’ll take 9 months to see a benefit, that will set you back a whopping $630! Is that worth it to you? The Beauty Brain’s bottom line Imedeen has some slick marketing and even a couple of “studies” to back up what they say. But with the prices they charge, the weakness of their data and the fact that you’ll still have to apply sunscreens and moisturizers, this doesn’t seem like a smart purchase at all. You’d be better off saving up your money for plastic surgery. Or even better, eat a balanced diet filled with fruits & vegetables. You’ll get all the unprocessed vitamins & minerals your skin needs. And as far as collagen, bird’s nest soup or ginseng giving you better skin…I don’t think so. Update: See this post for more research about Imedeen .","Is Imedeen good for my skin?","637f45c1111bca7722cf0caae835fdd73f13d7a5","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2008/10/is-imedeen-good-for-my-skin/"
"The Beauty Brains","2016-09-30 08:05:00","Does bodiphier relaxer safely straighten hair? by The Beauty Brains Crystal’s question : Can you please do a review of this product? I am African American and want to get away from chemical straightening. Is there such a thing as a natural hair relaxer? The Left Brain responds: The Beauty Brains have blogged before about how to straighten your hair (see 7 Ways to Straighten Your Hair for more details) but I’ve never heard of this Bodiphier product until now. Unfortunately, it doesn’t look like this is a natural, non-chemical alternative to relaxers. You can read all about it on the Bodiphier website but essentially this product is a weaker version of a lye relaxer. Bodiphier Ingredients Purified Alkaline Water, 100% Natural Soda Ash & Minerals, 100% Natural Citric, 100% Natural Menthol, Cetyl Wax, Emulsifying Wax, Petrolatum, Mineral Oil, Lanotrol, Volpo 10, Methyl Paraben, Propyl Paraben, 100% Natural Protein Powder, Shea Butter, 100% Natural Protein Oil, 100% Natural Soy Bean Oil, and Fragrance The key active ingredient is soda ash, also known as sodium carbonate, which is an alkaline material used in a variety of industrial applications from food preparation to pool sanitization. Sodium carbonate raises the pH of the product and allows it to soften the chemical bonds that connect the protein fibrils in hair. Once these chemical bonds are broken, or relaxed, the hair becomes straighter. Lye vs Bodiphier I would have to say that Bodiphier’s claim about being milder than typical lye relaxers is true. That’s because the active ingredient in true relaxers is sodium hydroxide, a chemical which is more more caustic than sodium carbonate. Bodiphier’s pH is 12, which is a bit lower than most relaxers that tend to be 12 to 13. But while Bodiphier will be less damaging to your hair it will also provide less of a relaxing effect. Depending on your hair type, this may be perfectly fine, but don’t expect Bodiphier to be a safer way to straighten really kinky hair. The Beauty Brains bottom line Bodiphier is a more gentle, but less effective, way to straighten hair. However, it’s not really fair to say that’s it’s more “natural” than relaxers. Both types of products use ingredients that are chemically derived from natural sources. Amazon.com Widgets What do YOU think? What’s your favorite way to straighten or relax your hair?

"The Beauty Brains","","Are natural products better than synthetic? by The Beauty Brains Andreea asks: I’m thinking of buying the Korres Pomegranate Balancing Moisturizer. Their products are silicone free, mineral oil free, propylene glycol free and ethanolamine free. What do you think about Korres? Are they better since they’re more natural? The Left Brain communicates about Korres: The Korres products do appear to be tantalizingly natural. They make a big deal out of the fact that they don`t use mineral oil or propylene glycol. But if you’re a regular reader of the Beauty Brains , you already know that mineral oil is perfectly fine for your skin! (And basically the same is true of propylene glycol.) According to their website, Korres pride themselves on broadly avoiding synthetic components that can sum up to 30 to 60% of a cosmetic formula, replacing them with greatly beneficial naturally derived ingredients. Sounds too good to be true, doesn’t it? But are their products really more natural? I see from looking at the ingredient list for the Pomegranate skin moisturizer you mentioned that they do use natural ingredients. For example, the formula contains plant extracts like Punica Granatum Extract (Pomegranate), Simmondsia Chinensis Seed Oil (Jojoba), Macadamia Ternifolia Seed Oil, and Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, to name a few. But I also see C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Pentylene Glycol, Sucrose Cocoate, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Dicaprylyl Ether, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Lauryl Glucoside, Methylparaben, PEG 8, Polyglyceryl 2 Dipolyhydroxystearate, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Propylparaben, and Carbomer. These ingredients are emulsifiers, thickeners, and preservatives that are used in many other unnatural cosmetics. So at best, Korres’ claim about replacing synthetic components with naturally derived ingredients seems to be a bit of a stretch. This argument really comes down to a case of what is considered natural and what is not. I think everyone would agree that pomegranate extract is natural. But what about mineral oil which is refined from petroleum that comes out of the earth? It is it any more or any less natural? Since there is no single definition of what constitutes natural there is no clear answer. Companies can pretty much say anything they want about natural even if they’re exploiting consumer ignorance and fear of chemistry to make a buck. I’m not saying the Korres product isn’t a good moisturizer. I’m just put off by the fact that they’re trying to mislead consumers with bad information.","Are natural products better than synthetic?","014e6a7bcb0b9432e21026cf9effe4a21154f201","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2007/05/are-natural-products-better-than-synthetic/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Does John Frieda’s brilliant brunette make a difference? by The Beauty Brains Dalena dares to ask… I would like to know the scoop on John Frieda’s Brilliant Brunette products. Do they really make a difference on brunettes? The Right Brain responds: Frieda’s Brilliant Brunette line consists of shampoos and conditioners, glazes and styling products, all aimed at different shades of brown hair. Do Brilliant Brunette products function any differently than “regular” products? Not really. Basically Frieda is just adding a little color to the products to make them more appealing to brunettes, there’s no special technology here. Read the labels carefully – they don’t even make any special claims! All they say is stuff like this: Developed exclusively for brown hair, this collection exposes the unique richness of brunette. Ultra-conditioning formula rehydrates and revitalizes dull, dry, brittle hair for renewed silkiness and exceptional shine Restores the multi-dimensional richness of brown hair while invigorating highlights Brings out the multi-dimensional richness of brunette…without adding or depositing color With regular use, dry lackluster brown hair will develop incredible radiance and a silky texture Low-pH formula features cocoa bean extract and crushed pearls For natural, color-treated or highlighted brunettes Other than telling you it will make your hair shiny, they’re really not saying all that much. The glazes are a little different than typical products but even they don’t do very much. You can read our earlier post on glazes if you’re interested. For styling products the story is pretty much the same: the styling cream illuminates brown tones and creates silky perfection; whatever that means. Since brunette hair doesn’t really have different styling needs than other hair colors, it doesn’t even make technical sense to have separate products. That’s totally driven by marketing, not science. The Beauty Brains bottom line The Brilliant Brunette products are brilliant – from a marketing perspective. And they’re fine formulas. If you like ‘em, use ‘em. But they don’t do anything special for brown hair.","Does John Frieda’s brilliant brunette make a difference?","594d9793497362f230597c8296f2f023d820feaa","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2010/04/does-john-friedas-brilliant-brunette-make-a-difference/"
"The Beauty Brains","2014-03-30 07:42:00","Scientists speak about cosmetic animal testing by The Beauty Brains A couple weeks ago, we were contacted by a student who was working on a science project about cosmetic animal testing . She gave us a few interesting questions which we thought we would pass along here. Seeking Student Says… Could you answer the following questions about animal testing for my school science project? Left Brain Responds : Animal testing ban? 1. Do you think that animal testing for cosmetics should be banned? Explain. While I don’t like animal testing, there are currently no suitable alternatives for some types of tests. I don’t think animal testing should be banned until there are alternative tests that help prove products are safe. Medicine versus Cosmetics 2. Should animal testing be banned for cosmetics, but still be allowed for medicine? Animal testing is not something that anyone wants to do. We scientists feel the same affection for animals as everyone else. (I love my cat!) But until alternative tests are better developed, banning animal testing for either cosmetics or medicine seems unethical. All life is sacred, but human lives are more sacred than animal lives. EU and Animals 3. The European Union has recently agreed to a ban on animal testing for cosmetics said to happen in 2009. Do you agree with their decision? What could be the Pros. and Cons. of this decision? I don’t agree or disagree with the decision made by the EU. The truth is cosmetics are not vital for living a healthy life. The result of banning animal testing will be that no new cosmetic products will be made. All you will get in the future are color & bottle changes using the same products you have today. Cosmetic innovation will stop. Solutions to acne, dandruff, dry skin, frizzy hair, etc. will not be developed. Fortunately, the products available now are often good enough. If these problems were never solved and there were never a new cosmetic made, the world would be just fine. However, it seems strange people get upset about animal testing, but still eat meat, kill mice & rats, and wear leather products. Pros of a ban: fewer animals will be killed Cons of a ban: Cosmetic problems will not be solved, no new ingredients will be used, innovation stops Naturally better? 4. Would you rather use cosmetics made with natural ingredients (that don’t need to be tested), or with toxic ingredients that have been tested? It is not true that natural ingredients do not need to be tested. ALL ingredients in cosmetics have been tested on animals. Whether they are natural or not doesn’t matter. Chemistry is not as simple as classifying ingredients as “toxic” or “natural”. We’ve done a variety of posts on natural ingredients that can kill you. Natural ingredients to avoid Water can kill you When it comes to chemicals exposure level is what’s important. Sometimes small amounts of “toxic” ingredients are safer than large amounts of “non-toxic” ingredients. Do You Use? 5. Do you use cosmetics products that have been tested on animals? Would you think twice about using these products, or even try to reduce or stop using them? Yes I do. So do you. Everyone uses products that have ingredients that were tested on animals. It is a lie when companies say they don’t test on animals. ALL cosmetics have been tested directly or indirectly on animals. The truth is, very few cosmetic companies directly test their products on animals. Animal testing is expensive and terrible for public relations. Companies who say they don’t test on animals either use ingredients that were already tested on animals or have their raw material suppliers do the animal testing. They can argue that they never tested their formula on animals (which they technically don’t) because they know they are using only raw materials that have already been tested on animals (by someone else). Since all ingredients have been tested on animals, there does not seem to me to be any moral high ground to avoiding companies based on whether they claim to test on animals or not. Animal Testing Ended? 6. With all the efforts to stopping animal testing for cosmetics, do you think that it’s possible to one day completely get rid of animal testing for cosmetics? Yes, I believe one day animal testing of cosmetics will be a thing of the past. Everyone wants to get rid of this type of testing. No one wants to hurt animals. Scientists are working hard to create testing alternatives that work. We are just now seeing some tests that are receiving approval from governmental agencies. I believe withing 10 – 20 years animal testing of cosmetics will be practically non-existent. But until there are reliable testing alternatives (there aren’t yet) animal testing will still be necessary. What are your thoughts on cosmetic animal testing? Does it affect your decision when deciding what products to buy?

"The Beauty Brains","","What everyone should know about hair dye by The Beauty Brains Sonia says: I have natural black hair and for years I had dyed it light brown. Then one day went back to black. Now my question is how do I get it back to brown? I’ve tried several dyes and nothing has changed but my roots. The Right Brain responds: How do you get your hair from black back to brown? You need to bleach out the dark color before you can add the lighter brown shade. You should probably have this done in a salon, but if you do decide to do it at home, make sure you buy the right kind of hair dye. In case you didn’t know, there are 3 different types of hair colors. Here’s a quick description along with the pros and cons of each: The 3 Types of Hair Colors Temporary Color This is basically a colorful gel or cream that coats your hair. It lasts 1, maybe 2, shampoos at best. Sometimes less if you’re sweaty! Manic Panic is a good example of this kind of product. And if you’re really feeling frisky, Betty Beauty even makes a temporary color for hair *ahem* down there. Pros: You can go crazy and make your hair day-glo red, blue, yellow or orange! Cons: You run the risk of looking like a clown, which is bad. But only for a day or so, which is good. Unless the circus is in town that day, which is bad. Semi or Demi Permanent Color These colors use ingredients known as “direct dyes.” They stain the hair and take several shampoos to wash out. The new Sunsilk Color Boost products use this type of dye. Pros: Let’s you experiment with a touch of color without much commitment. Cons: The colors usually aren’t very good and you can’t add lighter shades on top of darker hair. Permanent (or Oxidative) Color This is the most serious type of hair color. It typically involves bleaching your hair to remove your natural color, then adds in color molecules that are locked inside the hair shaft. It should last until your roots grow out but some fading from washing will occur. Examples include Garnier Nutrisse, Revlon Colorist, and pretty much any coloring treatment you get in a salon. Highlights are a version of oxidative color but may only involve the bleaching step. Pros: When done properly, this kind of color looks fabulous and lasts for weeks even months. Cons: The chemical process is damaging to your hair, you’re stuck with the color for weeks (even months), and you have to recolor when your roots grow out. Statistics say that more than 60% of women color their hair. But that Betty Beauty product has got me wondering…how many women color their hair “down there?” Is that too scandalous?

"The Beauty Brains","","10 strangest fragrances you can actually buy by The Beauty Brains When we’re not answering questions, we here at the Beauty Brains read press releases, Twitter feeds , RSS feeds, blogs, and just generally Internet surf to find the latest news in the world of cosmetics. A recent story about Burger King launching a fragrance inspired this post about 10 strange fragrances. 10 Weird Fragrances 1. Burger King Fragrance According to this story, American fast food giant, Burger King is launching a men’s body spray known as “Flame” . It claims to be a “scent of seduction with a hint of flame-broiled meat.” You can purchase it through their website, Firemeetsdesire.com And I thought the Axe marketing was strange 2. Kiss Fragrance Would anyone really want to wear a fragrance dedicated to four sweaty guys in demon makeup? Someone thinks so because you can get your very own KISS fragrance on Amazon. Kerosene and stale beer never smelled better 3. Play Doh Fragrance Demeter takes the cake when it comes to odd fragrances. Their Play-Doh Fragrance is odd but would you believe you can get scents of Earthworm and Mushroom. Check out their how line on their website Demeter Fragrance.com Earthworm and Mushroom…yum 4. Vulva Fragrance We wrote about this odd fragrance a while back. Their website is still working so they must selling something. They describe the fragrance as “precious vaginal odor filled into a small glass vial. Not a perfume but a beguiling scent for your own smelling pleasure.” Your own smelling pleasure? Ewwh 5. Cheese perfume This one proves that if you can eat it, someone wants to smell like it. Stilton Cheeses launched their own scent a couple years back. Not sure if you can still get this one. Cheese makes everything better 6. Ageless Fantasy fragrance Knocks eight years off your life? We actually received a sample of this Ageless Fantasy fragrance, but had a difficult time reviewing it. It smells fine enough. We just couldn’t figure out how to prove it made Sarah look 8 years younger. Try Ageless Fantasy Fragrance yourself. Sounds like something the Smell & Taste Institute would have come up with. 7. Wode Paint Fragrance The world has been clamoring for a fragrance that also paints your skin right? Wait no longer. Wode paint has got you covered. You can see the fragrance/paint in action in this video from Trendhunter Don’t worry, the paint disappears 8. Penn State Perfume They may be going to the Rose Bowl but this one doesn’t smell anything like roses. Wouldn’t you rather smell like Joe Paterno anyway? Read all about Penn State perfume here. I hope Ball State doesn’t come out with a fragrance 9. Republican Fragrance Didn’t get your fill of politics this summer? Well you can smell like a Republican all the time with Republican fragrance . Available in Democrat and Independent versions too. I wonder if it smells like an elephant? 10. Whale Vomit Fragrance. This one is actually supposed to smell pretty good. I just couldn’t get passed knowing the origin. Is there ever a good reason to smell like mammal vomit ? I don’t think so. Of course, that’s a typical Saturday night for Sarah Were there some weird fragrances that we missed? Have you tried any of these?

"The Beauty Brains","","Spa bath with fish is a wash by The Beauty Brains Midbrain update… Here’s a follow-up to a fish bath story featured in a Beauty Science or BS poll from last year. In that story, we learned that some spas in China were using flesh-eating fish to exfoliate skin. Seattle Fish Spa Bath Well, the idea proved too enticing for one nail salon owner in Seattle . She started selling her own fish spa bath treatments. For $30 you could soak your feet for 15 minutes in a spa bath filled with tiny, flesh-eating fish. Customers apparently loved it. The government however, didn’t. They shut down the operation when it was deemed “unsanitary and potentially unsafe”. Alternatives to Fishy Spa Baths I don’t know if it’s unsanitary or not but it seems a bit strange. There are more efficient and less animal-involved ways to exfoliate your feet. For example, you can try Flexitol Foot Scrub , the Revlon Hand and Foot Exfoliator or even an Exfoliating Stone File . Unfortunately, none of these will feel quite the same as tiny creatures devouring your feet so if that’s what your into, you might want to save your money for a trip to China. Oh and by the way, now that she can’t offer the service any more, the spa owner said she would take the fish home as pets and sell the spa bath equipment on E-bay. Any buyers out there? Anyone else disappointed about not being able to get a fish exfoliating spa bath in the US?","Spa bath with fish is a wash","a7ed6aeb15ebc3073452326ab8791d099d24203f","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2008/10/spa-bath-with-fish-is-a-wash/"
"The Beauty Brains","","How to stop split ends by The Beauty Brains The Beauty Brains receive hundreds of questions each week and while we read each and every email, there’s no way we can answer them all. So, we thought we’d try something new – we posted a few of your recent questions in our Forum where we’re blessed with over 1000 helpful and knowledgeable members. Today we’re posting the best of their responses in answer to the following question… Jen asks: I used to bleach my hair and recently just dyed it to dark brown as my natural color because I realized my hair was damaged. Are there any products that I can use to help my hair not break off at the bottom? I always have slpit ends and my hair just doesn’t grow long. Please help thank you. The Beauty Brains Forum Responds: Janis Some products like coconut or olive oil are helpful for mitigating damage to your hair, and you shuld definitely be using a good conditioner — but overwhelmingly, the only thing that will get rid of splits is handling. You say that you used to bleach your hair — unfortunately, this will have damaged it, so you’ll have to wait for that damage to grow out. Even going darker damages hair since the process of dying hair lifts the cuticle scales on the outside of the hairshaft like the spines on a ticked-off porcupine. The process supposedly then smooths them back down, but they never go back exactly the way they were. The fundamentals of gentle hair handling are: wear it up completely up when you can, bunned is best but at least off your back. Don’t use elastics at the ends of your hair. Use VERY LITTLE to no heat treatment: blow dryers, flatirons, curling irons, all of that. No color — bleach and double-process is damaging inherently. Comb instead of brushing. Generally, don’t fuss with it as much and it’ll be much happier. If you like to blow dry or flatiron, and see yourself dyeing your hair again in the future, it may be that split ends will be something you just have to battle. Anne The only real solution for split ends is to have them trimmed off. It will help your hair look healthier. If you have regular trims, your hair also seems to grow faster. I know it doesn’t really, but it seems like it. I regularly dye my hair to cover grey, but don’t have a problem with split ends. You can blow your hair dry with little damage as long as you point the air down the length of your hair and stop as soon as its dry. Janis I’ve never actually had my hair grow with regular trims, and it’s down to mid-thigh. I found that I couldn’t expect busy stylists to remember with exact precision “not as short as it was six weeks ago but shorter than now.” As a result, when I got regular trims, my hair stalled at shoulder length for years. I found that when I handled my hair gently and wore it up frequently (as I do now; I LOVE hairtoys!) it grew quickly, and I only needed trims every six months or so. The secret to long hair is to handle it gently, wear it up, and simply don’t cut it. Cutting results in nothing but shorter hair; it took me years of frustration before this simply truth occurred to me. Some trims are needed as you see splits, but “regular” often just means that you’ll be getting new growth trimmed away at the same rate at which it’s generated. Again though, it depends on how long the original poster is aiming for. Most people are quite content with mid-back as “long,” which means that a year or two of no-trimming will be fine followed by maintenance trims for life. Jules Try putting a bit a of silicone based products from the middle to the tips of your hair… I do this twice a day – once in the morning before I go anywhere and once before i got to bed. The silicone coats the hair and protects the cuticle and helps prevent anymore damage being done to it. I also recommend serious oiling with olive oil and coconut oil combined. Another thing – try washing your hair less often with shampoo – or if you can’t do that try shampooing with a shampoo with a milder surfactant so that it’s not that harsh on your hair. And one last thing – i hear that “glossing treatments” are also good at protecting your hair from anymore damage – apparently it coats the hair – but i’m trying to find more out about that at the moment. Your hair salon will do glossing treatments. Krsn89 To help out your hair a bit, make sure to get regular trims. As much as it sucks, especially if you’re trying to grow your hair out, it’s the only way you can *actually* get rid of split ends. No matter what marketing tells you, even those things that claim to mend your split ends, what’s done is done and you need to get ‘em trimmed! If you blowdry and/or flat iron, weekly deep conditioning is a must, to keep your hair moisturized and healthy. Also a must if you heat style are protein treatments once a month. If your hair is damaged, it could be worthwhile to use a product that has protein listed, whether it be a shampoo, condish or styling product. Protein will be listed as hydrolyzed wheat protein or soy protein, etc. Lastly, make sure you use at least a heat protectant or a leave-in conditioner before heat styling every time, so at least *some* damage will be prevented. For deep conditioning there’s a variety of masks available, high end and from the drugstore. You can also use coconut oil as a mask with heat for half an hour or so, just make sure it’s raw and unrefined coconut oil. Popular protein treatments are Nexxus Keraphix (light protein), Bumble&bumble “Deeep” (light) and Nexxus Emergencee and ApHogee (lotsa protein!) If you’re experiencing breakage at the bottom, find neat hairstyles to wear that will keep your hair up and out of the way of car windows, fans, excessive rubbing on the back of chairs etc. Also make sure though that you use hair friendly styling things, like no snag elastics and barrettes, because if you don’t, simple things like elastics can pull a lot of hair out, and that defeats the purpose of tying your hair up in the first place! If you use silicone laden shampoos/condishes and/or styling products, make sure you clarify every once in a while to stop buildup that *might* lead to potential breakage. And last but not least, if you don’t have one already, get a good, seamless wide-toothed comb. Apparently, you should never brush hair when wet – it stretches and is more prone to breakage, so combs are the way to go. A big BB thanks to Janis, Anne, Jules and Krsn89 for their answers.

"The Beauty Brains","","Why you’ll never want to wear panties again by The Beauty Brains Hi Beauty Brainiacs , Sarah Bellum here with another beauty product review. The Left and Right Brains have written about intimate shaving before, so today I’m reviewing a different kind of product to help you stay bare down there: Go Commandos panty free patches. Everyone has that special pair of pants that look too good to spoil with panty lines. (For me it`s a pair of LaZer jeans with cut outs in the side.) Thongs are great for getting rid of VPLs (Visible Panty Lines), but the thong sticking up above the waist line is not a look that I care for. So, that leaves no other choice but to skip the panties entirely. And that means you`ve got that uncomfortable seam to deal with right? Wrong. Now you can go commando with Go Commandos, a unique product that lets you skip the panty portion of your wardrobe. Go Commandos are a uniquely shaped cotton patch that sticks to the inside seam of your jeans and pants so you can go underwear free and not have to worry about comfort and hygiene. And it`s not only for fun and fashion, there are actually medical reasons to go commando. According to Dr. Lisa Rehrer, OB-GYN old school cotton Granny panties are fine, but silk and nylon panties and thongs are not absorbent and they can restrict circulation and cause sweating. This can lead to a condition known as vulvitis, which basically means you`re irritated and chaffed down there. It can also lead to bacterial infection. Go Commandos, are also made of cotton so they`re absorbent, natural, and non-irritating. But they give you a feeling of freedom while the cotton patch protects your private parts. After trying the different styles they offer for different types of pants, I`ve decided that I LOVE the way they feel with jeans! These patches were super cushy and comfortable. But I was less thrilled with the way the Delicates version felt on thinner fabric, like my Capris and Khakis. I felt TOO naked, if that makes sense! I`ve still got some dressier pants that I`m dying to try them with too. My only concern with the product itself was with the hassle with applying and removing the patches. You`ve got to put them on and take them off each time you undress. For special occasions they`re totally worth it, but I don`t really need an extra step in my daily morning routine. I can barely get ready for work on time as it is! Of course that`s just my personal preference, you`ll have to try these patches for yourself and see what you think. I’d recommend them to anyone who has a major panty line problem.","Why you’ll never want to wear panties again","74821770c4e20bdbc7f9fec2388364ca12d63ab5","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2007/05/why-youll-never-want-to-wear-panties-again/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Are women’s razors different from men’s? by The Beauty Brains B. Cluz asks… Is there really a difference between men and women’s razors? The women’s razors always seem to be more expensive and I’ve heard it’s because they put in those moisturizing strips, women’s hair is different, etc, etc. But honestly, can’t we use a men’s razor to do the same thing? The Left Brain’s razor sharp reply: There is a popular notion belief that women’s razors get dull faster so they must be different. But when you compare apples to apples there doesn’t seem to be much real difference. Razor reality First, it is likely you’ll see differences if you’re comparing different brands at different price points. For example, if you’re comparing a basic Schick disposable for women to a Gillette Mach 3 for men with triple blades and a moisturizing strip, yeah, you will see differences. Second, you may also see differences in razor performance because of the difference in how men and women shave. Men shave thicker beard hairs off their face that has a relatively small surface area. Women shave thinner hairs off both legs that have a much larger surface area. Scraping across all that leg skin can dull a blade much faster. Masculine marketing If you want to read more, here’s a USA Today article that discusses Gillette’s expansion of their Mach 3 vibrating razor technology into their Venus line for women. While there’s no proof that the blades are the same, there’s no mention of any fundamental differences in technology between the two either. But even if the razor’s aren’t very different technically, the razor companies should know how to market to men and women differently. Here’s a great post from Learned On Women about how NOT to market to women. This blog tells the truth about marketing to women the same way The Beauty Brains tells the truth about science. Check it out. The Beauty Brains bottom line The simple answer is, yes, you can use a man’s razor. There are obvious differences like color, style, feel of the grip, etc., but functionally they’ll both cut hair the same way. Have YOU ever shaved with a man’s razor? Did you notice a difference?

"The Beauty Brains","","The best way to find out if you’re allergic to a cosmetic by The Beauty Brains Corey’s curious: What’s in Mary Kay’s Timewise line that isn’t in anything else? I recently had a severe allergic reaction to it and I’ve never never had a reaction to anything else in my entire life. I’ve been using Sabon NYC`s Seaweed line , and Lush’s Ocean Salt and never has any problems. What gives? The Left Brain Responds: To start with, let’s take a look at the ingredient list for Timewise: Water, Mineral Oil, Glycerin, Isotheral, Neopentanoate, Bentonite, Cetyl Dimethicone Copolyol, Octyl Pelargonate, Neopentyl, Glycol Dioctanoate, Myristyl Myristate, PPg-26-Buteth-26, Sorbitol, Sucrose, Distearate, Peg-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Oleyl Oleate, Tocopherol, Comfrey Extract, Burdock Extract, Hops Extract, Yarrow Extract, Meadowsweet Extract, Hydrocotyl Extract, Coneflower, Extract, Camellia Sinensis Extract, Retinyl Palmitate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Triethanolamine, Sucrose Stearate, Butylene Glycol, Propylene Glycol, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Carbomer, Disodium EDTA, Diazolidinyl Urea, Carnauba Wax, Lactose, Methylparaben, Cellulose, Propylparaben, C9-15 Alkyl Phosphate, Phenoxyethanol, Lauramine Oxide, Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose, Titanium Dioxide, Ultra-marines, Chromium Hydroxide Green FD&C Red 4, D&C Red 33. It’s hard to say which of these ingredients is causing you to have a reaction. Normally, I’d say it’s the fragrance since that’s typically the ingredient that people have the most allergic reactions to. But in this case, there doesn’t appear to BE a fragrance. Most of the other ingredients are used in a lot of other products, so it’s unlikely that they’re the culprits. That narrows the list down to the few ingredients that are relatively unusual. For example, you don’t see glycol dioctanoate or octyl pelargonate used that much. Some of the extracts, like Hops, Meadowsweet, and Hydrocotyl aren’t seen all that often either. Then again, it may not be a single ingredient. You could be reacting to a combination of chemicals that are unique to this product. There’s really no way to tell. The Dermatologists’ Secret Allergen List So what’s the best way to predict which products will cause an allergic reaction? I suggest you check with your dermatologist about C.A.R.D. CARD, or Contact Allergen Replacement Database, is a list of products that are free from specific allergens. Your doctor can help you use this tool to avoid products that are likely to give you reaction. According to PubMed, this approach has proved to be an invaluable tool for both physicians and their patients in contact allergy counseling. If you’re interested in learning more, check with your dermatologist. What do you think? Do you have specific ingredients that you know you’re sensitive to?

"The Beauty Brains","","Make your own sugar scrub by The Beauty Brains Hello Beauty Brains community. Today, we have a guest post from a cosmetic chemist who started her own company. Joan Brindle, cosmetic chemist and owner of The Creative Cosmetic Company shares her recipe for a terrific sugar scrub. Make Your Own Sugar Scrub A few years ago as I was getting ready to make my annual bath and body gifts for the Holidays, I invited afriend to join me in making some sugar scrubs. My friend said “oh, I already make those and it’s really simple. I just mix cooking oil and sugar together and add some fragrance oil.” Yikes, I had seen those homemade sugar scrubs before. They were nothing but gloopy, oily messes! That year, I made sure to include a jar of my home-made sugar scrub with her gift. Since then my friend has learned that for just a few pennies more, she can create a much higher end product that stays emulsified and provides some nourishing benefits for her skin. Now, we make our scrubs together every year. The following recipe can be adjusted as you like but the end product will make a very large 16 ounce jar full of sugar scrub. I use kitchen measurements instead of weights because most people have measuring cups and spoons but not many have accurate scales to weigh quantities. Hint (use heaping tablespoons if you want your sugar scrub firmer.) Sugar Scrub recipe Directions: 3 Tablepoons emulsifying wax 4 Tablespoons Stearic acid 4 Tablespoons Palm kernel oil Melt all of the above ingredients until completely melted in the microwave. About 2 minutes. (It should not have any little white sand-like dots in it when it is done melting) Use pot holders it should be really hot! Mix in ¾ cup sweet almond oil, 2 cups sugar and approximately ½ teaspoon fragrance oil. Stir and let cool a bit. Pour into plastic jars. This will harden up over the next day and become firm but pliable. Use Instructions To use: pinch a small amount, rub all over your body with your hands, washcloth or scrubby. Because of the fragrance oil, this is not meant to be used on your face. Best if used within 2 months. This product is mild enough to use every day. As with any product, discontinue use if you develop any reaction to this product. You can get more recipes and sources to buy ingredients from Joan’s website at www.thecreativecosmeticcompany.com If you like these DIY recipes please leave a comment below and let us know. If there is enough interest, we’ll post more.","Make your own sugar scrub","3047bb63aea95068e8c04a4b19774969376d0281","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2008/12/make-your-own-sugar-scrub/"
"The Beauty Brains","None","Beauty q&a: does malibu treatment remove hard water and rust stains from hair? by The Beauty Brains The Cynical One Says: I want to know what you think about getting a “Malibu Treatment” to remove the chemical residue from well water? Does well water effect blonde hair? What does a Malibu treatment actually do? Can I do this at home? Is this even worth my time, or can I just use a claryifying shampoo from time to time? The Right Brain Responds: There are two main problems that COULD be caused by using well water. The first is hard water residue which is formed when soap comes in contact with “hard” metal ions such as calcium and magnesium. The soap interacts with the metal ions forming an insoluble “gunk” that sticks to the sides of the tub. Well water woes Is this a serious problem? We doubt it because modern shampoos use cleansers known as surfactants that don’t interact with the metal ions so you shouldn’t really be getting much water residue on your hair. In other words, a bar of soap might cause this to happen, but shampoo and body washes would not. The second problem is rust deposition which occurs when there’s a high concentation of iron in the water. Rusty well water CAN stain light colored hair an orangish-yellow color, but we doubt that this is a serious problem for most people either. If your water is that bad, you’re probably using a water softener anyway! IF you did get hard water deposits on your hair what should you do? A quick web search shows a lot of homemade remedies recommending vinegar and lemon juice, which are mildy acidic. In reality, an alkaline cleanser remove hard water deposits better, NOT an acidic one. So much for believing everything you read on the web… Kick it with a chelator But the best thing would be to use a chemical agent called a “ chelator ” that ties up the metal ions and makes the residue easier to use. It just so happens that the Malibu 2000 Well Water Action Shampoo and the Malibu 2000 Quickin Demineralizing treament DO contain an effective chelating agent known as EDTA. Without testing, we can’t be sure these products really work because the pH of the product and the concentration of EDTA are important. BUT, at least they look promising. If you do decide to try them, you’ll have to disregard all the claims Malibu makes about the hard water deposits clogging your pores and stopping hair growth. There’s no data to show that hard water causes hair loss! The Brain’s Bottom Line: Given the prevalence of soft water we think that, unlikely, but not impossible for you to experience significant problems. Hard water and iron deposits are probably more of a made up marketing need than a serious hair care problem. But, if you have experience with either problem we love to hear about it and what you did to fix it. What do YOU think? Are hard water deposits a problem for YOUR hair?

"The Beauty Brains","","Even more alternative uses for petroleum jelly by The Beauty Brains Mid Brain muses: I saw the Beauty Banter blog wrote a short piece about 5 unconventional uses for Vaseline . She includes using it as a makeup remover, an eyebrow conditioner, a shaving aid and a mixer to modify your other makeups. We’ve blogged about Vaseline before and these are some great tips. Now here are a few more you could try. Lip balm – It won’t taste good but it works. Perfume extender – A thin layer on your wrist before putting on your fragrance will make it last longer. Manicure protector – Stop your color from running by putting some on the base of your nails. Hair styler/conditioner – You can temporarily seal split ends, slick hair and even condition. Just don’t use too much. It may take a few shampooings to remove. Prevent chafing – Runners know this trick. Apply some in the susceptible areas before you go out. Cover scratches in wood – Dab some on scratches on wood floors or furniture and buff. Light scratches will be camouflaged. Shine shoes – Dab and buff. This works but they will also get duller faster than using regular shoe polish. Stop squeaks . Noisy doors, cabinets, bikes, etc. can all be silenced with a strategically placed dab of the stuff. Light bulb releaser – Just put a little around the thread of a new light bulb before screwing it in. This makes it much easier to remove when the light burns out. Incidentally, the store brand petroleum jelly is not much different from the brand name, so you can save yourself some money. And of course you could always try the opposite of petroleum jelly – “Un Petroleum Jelly…” Is there a more versatile product than petroleum jelly? Or a more vilified one?

"The Beauty Brains","2017-05-30 07:47:00","Is band-aid blister block a rip off? by The Beauty Brains Chelsea feels cheated: I just bought a tube of Band-Aid Blister Block , and while it’s working wonders with my new shoes, I’ve got a question. The ingredients listed are hydrogenated vegetable oil, cetyl alcohol, parfum. Did I just buy the most expensive, scented shortening, or is this molecularly different enough to justify the price? I’m not sure how much I’d like to rub Crisco on my feet every morning, but if it does the job just as well, I may just try it! The Right Brain restores her faith in modern chemistry: We LOVE questions like this because it shows you’re reading the label to learn about ingredients in your products. You’re already on your way to becoming a smarter shopper! Have a blister, sister? Band-Aid Blister Block is indeed composed mostly of hydrogenated vegetable oil, a Crisco-like compound made by adding hydrogen to certain kinds of vegetable oil. But the oil is not alone; it’s combined with cetyl alcohol, a waxy solid. When the cetyl alcohol and the hydrogenated oil are mixed in the right ratios, they form a stick that gives you the best of both worlds: it’s soft enough to spread easily on your skin, but hard enough to leave a protective layer that doesn’t leave a greasy mess. This protective layer helps the shoe straps slide across your skin without chafing. Ergo, no blister. (Finally, after two years we figured out how to use the term “ergo” in a post!) Would Crisco alone work just as well as the Band-Aid Blister Block ? Maybe, but it wouldn’t give the right balance of lubricity and protection. And it wouldn’t feel as elegant. (And you might have to take a spa bath to get your feet clean.) But hey, if you’re the do-it-yourself type you could give it a try. Or better yet, we can ask Sarah Bellum to do the experiment for us.

"Randy Schueller","None","What lip balm should you use? by Randy Schueller DVG declares… My lips have been chapped and dry – which causes me to do the worst thing for them: I unconsciously bite at them when they are chapped. I have tried several lip balms and is it possible that they can cause my lips to dry out more than moisturize them? I’ve tried these: Nivea Moisture and Burt’s Bee’s balm in a tin. Both drying. Can you help me find one that is truly moisturizing? Thank you! Left Brain’s Lippy Reply Lip balm is an individual thing. One type may work for one person but not for you. I personally love Carmex Lip Balm . During winter, I can’t get enough! But on to your question. Perhaps if we look at the ingredients of ones you tried, we can figure out what is going on and steer you towards another type that might give you better results. Common Lip Balm ingredients? First, you should ask yourself which ingredients are common. Maybe the effect is caused by a common ingredient. The only common ingredient between the Burt’s Bees and Nivea formulas is Beeswax, and Nivea doesn’t contain much. So, it’s not likely that a single ingredient is responsible for your dryness. More likely it is one of the oils (peppermint oil) in Burt’s Bees and something from the fragrance in the Nivea. Since a common ingredient doesn’t solve the mystery, it’s best to try different types of lip balm. Right Brain had previously written about the 6 different types of lip balm . Let’s see which kinds you tried. Lip Balm type The Nivea Moisture Lip Balm is based on Microcrystalline Wax. It contains a variety of other ingredients to make it feel nicer, spread more easily and taste better. Microcrystalline Wax, Octyldodecanol, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Cetyl Palmitate, Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Myristyl Myristate, VP/Hexadecene Copolymer, Polyglyceryl 3 Diisostearate, Cetearyl Alcohol, VP/Eicosene Copolymer, Coco Glycerides, Pentaerithrityl Tetraisostearate, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), C20 40 Alkyl Stearate, Copernicia Cerifera (Camauba) Wax, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Glycerin, Panthenol, Beeswax, Water, Fragrance Since this didn’t work for you, other Microcrystalline wax formulas may not work. If it’s the fragrance or one of the natural oils, then you might try Neutrogena lip balm. The Burt’s Bees balm contains the ingredients following ingredients Coconut Oil, Beeswax, Sweet Almond Oil, Peppermint Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate, Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Lanolin, Comfrey Root Extract, Rosemary Extract You are most likely reacting negatively to the Peppermint Oil. So, some alternative beeswax based product you can try is Aveeno Lip conditioner . But if beeswax is the problem, you might consider the following two options. 1. Petrolatum based balm One thing missing from both of the balms you tried was one of the best moisturizing ingredients on the planet, Petrolatum. To soothe your sore puckering projectors, try Vaseline Lip Therapy . 2. Petrolatum Plus If the taste or feel of Vaseline doesn’t suit you, try my favorite Carmex Lip Balm . It is based on a Petrolatum / Lanolin blend. Either of these options should help with your problem. Addicted to Lip Balm You may be interested in this post we did on lip balm addiction to see why your lips dry out when you apply lip balm. It turns out the immediate moisturizing effect sends a signal to your skin to stop producing fresh skin cells which results in drier lips once the lip balm wears off. The whole thing could actually lead to a psychological addiction. Beauty Brains bottom line Which lip balm you should use is not a question that has a single answer. Only through trial and error will you be able to tell which one works for you, doesn’t dry out your lips and tastes right. Just pick ones that have different ingredients until you find what works. I love Carmex but Sarah hates the stuff! What kind of lip balm do you like and why?

"The Beauty Brains","","Naturally nasty: the top 10 natural ingredients you need to avoid by The Beauty Brains The Left Brain’s lesson: Here at the Beauty Brains we get tons of comments and emails telling us how all-natural ingredients are the best thing you can use on your hair and skin. We’ve previously explored the topic and have explained why we believe “natural” ingredients are neither superior nor inferior to “synthetic” ones. Both sources can provide good and bad ingredients. Being a biologist at heart, I thought this list of natural ingredients to avoid was interesting. Naturally Toxic Ingredients 10. Patulin : The patulin toxin produced by fungi found on rotting apples. It’s not especially dangerous but a few studies have shown it can cause DNA mutations. Watch out if you’re making your own apple juice to put in your DIY personal care products 9. Aflatoxin : Another toxin naturally produced by our fungi friends. Aflatoxins make their way into food crops like corn and peanuts. The compound has been shown to cause liver cancer in lab animals & has been associated with live cancer in humans. Governments monitor and regulate food for acceptable amounts of aflatoxin. Be careful about contaminated corn or peanut compounds in your cosmetics 8. Ergotamine : This is an alkaloid produced naturally by a food fungus that grows on rye and wheat plants. If not properly processed grains contaminated with ergotamine can end up in your bread and cause the disease ergotism. Not a problem if you don’t mind gangrenous infections of the limbs and hallucinations. This toxin is the starting point for making the drug LSD. 7. Mistletoe Lectin : People love mistletoe at Christmas but did you know this naturally growing plant is extremely toxic to humans? Any part of the plant can poison you and if ingested can cause vomiting, hallucinations, and blurred vision. Avoid any product said to contain Mistletoe extract. Unless hallucinating & vomiting is your idea of a good time. 6. Saxitoxin : This is a toxic material naturally produced by a common algae found in oceans around the world. When conditions are right, the little microscopic organisms produce saxitoxin , or red tide. If enough of it is introduced into your body, it causes paralysis and death. On occasion, people can get exposed to the poison by eating contaminated shellfish. Apparently algae extracts aren’t always advisable. 5. Batrachotoxin : Frogs are cute except for maybe the poison dart frog that makes one of the most toxic compounds known. Batrachotoxins are naturally produced by certain species of frogs, beetles and birds. If you get some of the compound in you, expect paralysis of your breathing muscles followed by death soon afterwards. Unfortunately, there is no effective treatment to stop the nasty effects of this natural substance. 4. Ricin : With a natural sounding name like ricin it’s got to be good right? Wrong. Ricin is a protein toxin that comes from castor beans. Yeah, this is the same plant that gives us the beneficial castor oil. If you’re exposed to enough ricin, it’ll cause diarrhea and death. Thankfully, man-made, synthetic purification processes can separate the good parts of the castor bean from the toxic ones. 3. Alpha-Amanitin : This is a simple, natural, toxic peptide produced by a mushroom. If you happen to eat some alpha-amanitin laced mushrooms you’ll feel cramps & diarrhea within 24 hours. Left untreated your kidneys and liver will be damaged beyond repair and you will die. This little natural molecule is considered one of the deadliest compounds known. Synthetic chemicals have nothing on this natural killer. 2. Anthrax Toxin : This natural ingredient is one you’ve probably heard about. This toxin is a combination of three proteins produced by a bacterium ( Bacillus anthracis ). It most often kills domestic animals like sheep and cattle but it can kill humans too. And you only need to be exposed to it on your skin. Anthrax ultimately causes death by respiratory and cardiac failure. And you thought protein was always good. 1. Botulinum Toxin : No list of natural toxins would be complete on a cosmetic site without the mention of this neurotoxic protein . While deadly, this compound can be used in small doses to remove wrinkles. Botox treatments are all the rage and are one of the most popular & profitable forms of cosmetic surgery. If you ingest this toxin however, you can expect paralysis, blurred vision, vomiting, among other symptoms. Ultimately, this natural compound will lead to respiratory failure and death. But in the hands of a good cosmetic surgeon, there’s not much to worry about. Yikes! So, the next time you hear someone droning on and on about how much better natural ingredients are than synthetics just remind them of these 10 All-Natural Nasties. Natural does not = good. Synthetic does not = bad. You have to look at each compound on an individual basis to make a judgment about them. And as Botox demonstrates, there is a safe way to use “toxic” ingredients no matter where they come from. Have we missed any natural toxins?

"The Beauty Brains","","The mascara you should never wear with contact lenses by The Beauty Brains Rebecca’s contact concern: I read at Consumer Reports.org that contact lens wearers should not use lash-extending mascaras because they contain microfibers that become trapped under the lens and scratch the cornea. What qualifies as a lash-extending mascara? Do the labels “lengthening” and “lash-extending” mean the same thing? Do they mean anything? If a mascara is labeled safe for contact lens wearers is it indeed safe? The Left Brain’s cautionary contact connection: Excellent question, Rebecca. I’m a big fan of Consumer Reports so I tracked down the article you referenced along with a few other resources. It turns out that there is a real reason for concern in this case. Contact concern After reading what Consumer Reports said I found another source, The Look You Like: Medical Answers to 400 Questions on Skin and Hair Care , that describes the basic problem: lash extenders consist of tiny synthetic fibers in a liquid base. When the liquid evaporates the fibers are left behind on the lashes, making them look longer. But as these fibers become loose they can stick get in your eye and become stuck to your contacts. I found additional details in a 1985 New York Times article that quoted Dr. Oliver H. Dabezies Jr., a clinical professor of ophthalmology at Tulane Medical School. Dr. Dabezies specified that the synthetic fibers used in masacaras are actually nylon fibers. I thought it was interesting that he notes using cosmetics with soft contacts is particularly risky because those types of lenses “are like sponges that absorb everything, including mascara.” So soft lenses are prone to clouding due to absorbed bits of mascara while hard lenses can trap nylon fibers that can cause painful scratches which can lead to eye infections. Safety testing What about mascara that claims to be safe for contact-lens wearers? According to the article, “even these claims, however, do not indicate whether the products have been tested with all types of lenses. Maybelline’s mascaras, for example, though labeled ”safe with contact lenses,” were not tested with the new extended-wear lenses. Nor has Max Factor’s ”For Your Eyes Only” line.” I recognize that this article is a bit dated, but it does make me wonder if these companies have updated their testing. Which brands contain nylon? I did a quick search and found several brands that use Nylon-6 or Nylon-12. Yves Saint Laurent MASCARA VOLUME EFFET FAUX CILS Luxurious Mascara Volume.com mascara The Body Shop mascara Revlon Lash Fantasy Total Definition Primer & Mascara You can do a quick check on your own brands by looking at the ingredient list for any chemicals that contain the term “nylon.” The Beauty Brains bottom line Based on what I’ve seen, if you wear contact lenses it might be wise to avoid using mascaras that contain nylon fibers. Product names like Longer Lash, Lush Lash, and Lash Lengthener, don’t really tell you very much, so to be safe you need to look at the ingredient list for any ingredient says “nylon.” What do YOU think? Do you wear contacts? What kind of mascara do you use?

"The Beauty Brains","","Why does my zit cream stop working? by The Beauty Brains Ella inquires… I’m using Neutrogena Advanced Solutions and I was wondering if it really works because it was working for a while and now it’s just not! What’s up with that? I want clear skin!!!! Can you recommend a better product? The Right Brain responds: Without more information it’s tricky to say for sure what’s caused the product to stop working. But, we have some theories. Sal acid versus BP You didn’t tell us which Advanced Solutions product you’re using, but if it’s the Skin Polishing Acne Cleanser it contains Salycilic Acid, one of the standard acne fighting ingredients that’s approved as on over the counter drug. It could be that your skin doesn’t respond well to this acne agent. If you haven’t already tried it, you could switch to one that contains benzoyl peroxide instead. (Actually, one of the other products in the Advanced Solutions line, the Overnight Acne Control Lotion, does use BP. You may find that your blemishes respond better to Sal Acid, BP or a combination of the two.) You might also try waiting a week or two and then using your Advanced Solutions product again. It could be that you’re experiencing an acne flare up that’s not related to the medication but that’s triggered by hormones or some other environmental factor. Maybe under “normal” conditions the product will work just fine for you. Fried food face By the way, if you think that too much fried food is causing your acne to flare up, go read this list of myths about what causes acne. You’ll be surprised at what DOESN’T make acne worse! We hope these suggestions help – you may have to experiment with several products before you find the one that’s just right for you.","Why does my zit cream stop working?","a8c8e18438b42efa2e3fccf08af93fc773adf467","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2010/04/why-does-my-zit-cream-stop-working/"
"Perry Romanowski","2017-06-20 08:11:00","How to protect your hair from heat damage by Perry Romanowski Jeanelle says: I was wondering if you guys could tell me what to look for in a great heat protecting spray/serum/lotion. What are the key ingredients that protect hair from heat? (Besides the ones that promise to deliver to soft, silky protected tresses when in reality they leave you with sticky, gross hair from all of the alcohol!) The Beauty Brains respond: Jeanelle, if you’re buying heat protection sprays that contain a lot of alcohol, you should change brands! Hopefully you’ll be able to pick a better product after we explain how heat damages your hair and what kind of ingredients can help. Blow drying is bad Blow drying causes a “flash drying” effect that not only removes the surface moisture but also removes water that is bound to the hair, which is called water of hydration. The effect of this flash drying is that the cuticles become dried, rigid and brittle. When the hair flexes, the pressure causes the cuticles to crack. One study (see Reference 1 below) showed cracks occurring not only on the surface layer of cuticles, but actually two and three cuticle layers deep. Combing hair with this degree of cuticle cracking causes significant breakage. Ironing is icky Ironing hair causes two different types of damaging depending on whether the hair is ironed dry or wet. Ironing dry hair causes radial and axial cracking along the edges of the cuticles, which can lead to chipping. Ironing wet hair causes the moisture to burst out in little steam explosions. This causes a bubbling and buckling of the cuticle that appears as tiny hair blisters under magnification. Helpful heat treatments Blow dry damage can be prevented by using products containing glycerin and propylene glycol because these actives retard water evaporation. Products like Tresemme Heat Tamer Spray should be helpful in this regard. You can also look for an ingredient called “hydrolyzed wheat protein polysiloxane copolymer,” which also showed significant reduction in cracking. Interestingly, while we would expect various silicones to have a similar effect, this study showed that silicones alone did NOT reduce cuticle cracking. Iron damage can be reduced by using conditioners formulated with low molecular weight conditioners that can penetrate into the hair like cetrimonium chloride. Another study (see Reference 2) showed that exposing hair to heat in the presence of such a conditioning agent actually caused an increase in tensile strength (the force required to break a hair). This is because the heat reacts with the conditioning agents and cross links some of the protein chains inside the hair. Look for products like Sunsilk Heat Defense Cream if you want this effect.

"The Beauty Brains","2015-02-03 10:48:00","Is wen conditioner a wonder? by The Beauty Brains Aspenstar wonders… What do you think of the Wen cleansing conditioners by Chaz Dean? supposedly they are not actually a shampoo, but a treatment product? Is it more hype than fact? Right Brain says Wen: The Left Brain previously wrote about Wen Cleansing Conditioners . Essentially concluding that WEN Cleansing Conditioner is a decent product that will clean your hair that isn’t too dirty. Left also concluded that using a store brand may be a better option. In this post, we’ll tell you the main things to look for in a cleansing conditioner. Why clean hair with conditioner? The first thing you might wonder is why would anyone want to clean their hair with conditioner. There are basically three reasons. Shampoo can damage hair Shampoo can strip color Shampoo has ingredients that can be irritating. Chaz Dean also says that his products stimulate the scalp but that doesn’t mean much. Shampoo damages hair It is true that shampooing can damage hair. It is not really the ingredients that cause damage, but the “sudsing-up” process. Moving your hair around twists and turns hair fibers making them susceptible to breakage. An added problem is that the hair is wet and more vulnerable to breakage. Skipping shampoo reduces hair damage. Shampoo can strip color While this is true, water is the real culprit for color loss. Shampoos speed the process a bit, but just getting hair wet is enough to pull out your color. If you use only a conditioner, your hair gets exposed to less water and loses less color. Ingredients that irritate Shampoo ingredients can be harsh and irritating. Sulfates are particularly bad, but almost ANY detergent in a shampoo will cause irritation if left on the head too long. Ingredients in conditioners can be just as irritating (or even worse) however, other ingredients are included that mitigate this problem. Ingredients in conditioner that clean hair You might be wondering what ingredients in conditioners clean hair. The primary cleaning ingredients are also the primary conditioning ingredients. Cationic surfactants are the cleaning/conditioning ingredients in conditioners. Look for these ingredients in your conditioner for cleansing. Behentrimonium Methosulfate * Dicetyldimonium Chloride * Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine * Cetrimonium Chloride Stearyalkonium Chloride *In the WEN Cleansing Conditioner product Best cleaning conditioner options That brings us back to the original question. Are WEN Cleansing Conditioners more hype than fact? No and Yes. Wen Works WEN Cleansing Conditioners will more gently clean your hair than shampoo. There is enough cleaning compounds in this conditioner to get most of the basic dirt out of your hair. (If your hair is really dirty, you’ll need to shampoo). Wen is not a wonder Wen cleansing conditioners do have a couple of drawbacks. First, they are way too expensive for what you get. Based on the list of ingredients, they are not much different than Pantene Conditioner . You could save yourself a lot of money by using Pantene the same way you would use Wen. A Better Option Unfortunately, neither Wen nor Pantene are your best choices for this type of product. Better (and less expensive) are Suave Conditioner or VO5 Conditioner . These are superior because the can clean your hair much better than Wen or Pantene. They use either Cetrimonium Chloride or Stearalkonium Chloride which are better cleansers. They also aren’t loaded with silicones which can make hair feel dirty if not proceeded by a shampoo step. Beauty Brains bottom line Eliminating shampooing and cleaning hair with conditioner only is a dramatic change from what you are used to. For many people, you won’t like how it feels. But for some (particularly those with long, curly or colored hair) you may love the way your hair feels. It will take a week or two to get used to but you might find it’s worth it.

"The Beauty Brains","2016-05-11 02:31:00","Beauty Q&A: What’s the difference between oil and moisture? by The Beauty Brains Tabitha Asks : Is there a difference between adding oil and adding moisture to the skin? This is usually a line used by those same sales people, who explain that dry skin needs a product that will add oil, but normal skin needs a product that adds *moisture*, NOT oil. A product that adds oil is easy enough to comprehend, but how do you add moisture? Won’t the water just evaporate without something (like an oil) to ‘seal’ it in? The Right Brain Replies : We love it when the readers answer their own questions! Water and oil Tabitha is right, pure moisture (which is just WATER!) will evaporate from the surface of the skin very quickly. Dry skin needs to be occluded, which means it needs something to prevent water from evaporating from the deeper, moist layers of the skin. Oily materials are very good at sealing moisture in the skin. That’s why you see things like petrolatum, lanolin, and mineral oil in most moistuirizers. All skin types need some degree of “oily” materials. Now, having said that, if you have very oily skin you don’t want a moisturizer that has a lot of heavy oils. And similarly, if you have dry skin, you don’t want a moisturizer that doesn’t have enough heavy oils. Finding the balance or your skin type is the trick. How about humectants? Oh, there is another option: some moisturizing ingredients known as a humectants are not oils and they work by attracting mosture from the air. Glycerine is an example of this kind of ingredient. However, we’re not aware of any lotions that ONLY use glycerine because a blend of humectants and oils is usually best.

"Perry Romanowski","","Does vaseline thicken eyelashes? by Perry Romanowski Ying Yearns For Longer Lashes: Does VASELINE petroleum jelly really helps to thicken and elongate eyelashes and eyebrows? The Left Brain Responds: Vaseline petroleum jelly, or petrolatum, as it is technically known, is a multipurpose cosmetic ingredient. It is an excellent moisturizer because it creates a barrier layer on the skin that retards water loss. It is also used as a base for many hairdressing products because it’s heavy, greasy consistency can help control flyway hair. Does it thicken and elongate eyelashes? I suppose that coating your lashes with any thick, greasy substance could, in theory, make them look longer and thick. But it will NOT physically increase the diameter or length of the eyelash itself. We’re sorry to tell you the Vaseline is not a great solution to lack luster lashes. Want to know more about this miracle goop? Here are my 3 favorite facts about Vaseline petroleum jelly: 1) According to some sources, the brand name Vaseline is a combination of the German word for water, wasser (pronounced vahser), and the Greek word for oil, elaion. 2) Robert Chesebrough, the inventor of the process used to purify petrolatum, used a clever trick when hawking his product. First he`d burn his skin with acid or a flame and then he`d apply petroleum jelly to the burned area. Finally he would show the audience how his previous burn marks had healed after treatment with his miracle product. Now let`s see the Right Brain try that! 3) Despite popular misconceptions, petroleum jelly is NOT a good sexual lubricant because it is oil-based and will dissolve latex condoms. (Once again, Right Brain please take note.)","Does vaseline thicken eyelashes?","b549d4138610d97b007958694be27095b667dd1a","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2006/11/does-vaseline-thicken-eyelashes/"
"The Beauty Brains","","How do you stop nail polish from bubbling? by The Beauty Brains The Beauty Brains receive hundreds of questions each week and while we read each and every email, there’s no way we can answer them all. So, we thought we’d try something new – we posted a few of your recent questions in our Forum where we’re blessed with over 1000 helpful and knowledgeable members. Today we’re posting the best of their responses in answer to the following question… Chris’s question: I’m having a problem with nail polish bubbling, but not on every nail and some nails are worse than others. I prep the nails by wiping them down with alcohol after the hand massasge and also scrubbing them with the nail brush and soapy water, then i apply a basecoat , 2 color coats (OPI), topcoat (Out the door), it seems as the nails are drying the bubbles appear? The Beauty Brains Forum responds: Anne Are you shaking the polish? This can cause the bubbles. Instead of shaking the bottles, slowly roll them in the palm of your hand to mix the polish. Purple Rules Keep the coats as thin as possible; three thin coats is better then two thick coats. Make sure you’re not sitting in a draft when you apply your polish. Don’t “work” the polish too much; the fewer brush strokes the better. This might mean getting polish on your cuticles but you can clean that up after with NP remover and a cuticle stick wrapped in cotton but there’s nothing you can do about bubbles. If you’re only using OPI, try a different brand. The older Revlons bubble on me but the newer ones (the big three free ones) don’t. You may have better luck with a different brand. I think that the reformulated OPIs are hit or miss. You might also try a different base coat. Janis When I used to wear it, I recall that some ones would bubble no matter what, and some wouldn’t. Revlon NEVER did — by far, that’s the best nail polish I’ve ever used back in the day. I think it just goes on in nice, thin coats — the cheaper stuff was always too gloopy and thick. Nail polish seemed to fall into two categories for me — the thick, cheap ones that bubbled and peeled, and the thin, cheap ones that were brittle and chipped off. Revlon was the best one, and was right in the middle — thin enough to not bubble and dry smooth, and pliable enough not to chip if you so much as looked at it. OPI’s supposedly pretty good, though; I’ve used it on my mom’s nails with no problems … hm. A big BB thanks to Anne, Purple Rules, and Janis for their answers. What do the rest of you think?

"The Beauty Brains","","The top 10 dry shampoos – and new Tresemme fresh start by The Beauty Brains We’ve blogged before about weird ways to wash your hair , in particular the hot trend of “dry shampooing.” Well, it looks like it’s time to update our list of the Top 10 Dry Shampoos because one of the biggest brands in the category has launched another one: Tresemme now has their version called Fresh Start. Tresemme Fresh Start Science Fresh Start uses technology that is similar to other dry shampoos: it’s a powder based aerosol spray. But while most competitors use either one or two powders (usually rice starch or Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate), Tresemme’s formula contains three or four, depending on the levels they’re using. Theoretically, this blend of powders could do a better job of absorbing oil which makes sense from a hair cleansing perspective.

However, it is a bit of pain to use. It’s just much easier to use an exfoliating product like St. Ives Apricot scrub and a daily facial wash. You pretty much get the same effect. Second, it doesn’t really look good in my bathroom. You have to leave it on the charger when you’re not using it which means it’s on the counter top clashing with the fabulous decor. Third, it’s not worth the money. $195 for this? Then another $25 for replacement brushes. I don’t know. If it gave results much better than regular products maybe, but it doesn’t. That money would be better spent on a cute pair of shoes. Of course if you are curious feel free to click on this Clarisonic Brush for more information. Maybe you go for gadgets more so than most of the Beauty Brains. (Not counting Sarah of course). Clarisonic recall But this isn’t the reason for writing this post. The real reason is that Dina’s post reminded me of a letter the Beauty Brains recently received from the company that makes Clarisonic. According to them, they are recalling any unit that was made prior to July 2007 is being recalled. It turns out there is some kind of electronic problem in the handle that makes it get really hot. So hot that it might actually catch fire. If you purchased one before July 2007, be sure to contact the company to get a replacement. Have you tried the Clarisonic? Leave a comment below and give us your thoughts.","Is your clarisonic skin brush dangerous?","20be7e9ec26375ac66b3cdd31e505028f27f7260","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2008/04/is-your-clarisonic-skin-brush-dangerous/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Can fish oil supplements improve your skin? by The Beauty Brains Julie’s Fishing For An Answer… Are the levels of fish oils in supplement form high enough to noticeably improve the appearance of your skin? (i.e., softer, more supple) The Right Brain ‘s Oily Reply: While the fish oil supplement companies will tell you otherwise, we’re going with the assessment of the American Academy of Dermatologists who summarized several studies evaluating the effect of fish oil on atopic dermatitis and psoriasis (basically, different dry skin conditions.) In neither case did they find any correlation between fish oil intake and improvement in skin condition. You can read the entire 90 page report on atopic dermatitis here. We’re not saying you shouldn’t take fish oil supplements, it just doesn’t look like they have much direct effect on your skin. You’re better off using a good lotion.","Can fish oil supplements improve your skin?","00afe1e86862b998f81c37e21f2ceded3a9052b3","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2008/12/can-fish-oil-supplements-improve-your-skin/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Can potato starch straighten your hair? by The Beauty Brains Haleigh’s hair hope: Okay someone told me that if I took the juice from a potato and let it sit in my hair that it would straighten it. Does this work? The Left Brain’s stiff response: Like I said when I blogged about using coffee to color hair , I love questions like this that can be answered by conducting an experiment. And while this question might sound silly question to some people, there actually is some science behind using potatoes for hair styling. Stiff not straight First of all, you should realize that only chemical treatments like relaxers can truly, permanently “straighten” hair that is really kinky or wavy. But styling products like gels and hairsprays can coat the hair and provide a temporary straightening effect by making the fibers stiff. Starting with starch Potatoes are rich in vegetable starch, the same kind of chemical that is used in laundry to stiffen fibers. So, it stands to reason that potato juice could be used on your hair to provide a stiffening effect much like a hair gel. I illustrated this effect with a simple experiment. I took a regular potato and chopped it up on a blender with a cup of water. This released the water-soluble starches in the potato which I then I filtered off and collected. The result was a cloudy, yellow solution. I then dipped a hair tress into this starch solution and let it dry over night. Here is a picture of the hair before applying the starch… and another one after the starch has dried… As you can see, the starch has made the hair much straighter and stiffer. While this proves potato starch CAN work on your hair, it doesn’t prove that it’s very good. The feel on the hair is terrible because the starch leaves it feeling heavy and sticky. Potato juice is NOT a practical way to straighten your hair. The Beauty Brains bottom line Potato juice can straighten your hair. But it doesn’t work nearly as well as styling products that are formulated specifically for that purpose. If you want to learn more, read our post on the 7 Sure Ways To Straighten Your Hair .

"The Beauty Brains","None","Should you worry about pee in your makeup? by The Beauty Brains Meagan Muses: I love your site– it makes me feel smarter all the time. I’ve got a question about diazolidinyl urea. I see it on labels for lotions and cleansers all the time. Doesn’t urea come from urine? That seems disgusting to me. What’s the story? The Right Kidney, uh, Right Brain , Replies: You’re sort of right Meagan, but not really. What is urea Let’s start by explaining that “diazolidinyl urea” is a preservative and it’s used in many cosmetics to keep microscopic bugs from spoiling the products you bought with your hard earned money. It so happens that urea is one of the compounds used to make this ingredient. In addition, urea is also used in some creams and lotions as a moisturizer. So urea is used in cosmetics, but does urea really come from urine? What is urine Well, urine DOES contain urea. That’s because urea excretion is just one of the ways your body gets rid of the excess nitrogen waste material that it generates. Different animals process this waste in different ways: Aquatic organisms excete it in the form of ammonia. Reptiles and birds excrete it in the form of uric acid. And we humans excrete it in the form of urea. Does urea come from urine But fret not – the source of the urea used to make cosmetic ingredients is not someone’s bladder. Industrial urea is synthetically made in large chemical reactors which are rarely, if ever, peed into. As a matter of fact, urea was the FIRST organic chemical ever to be synthetically created from inorganic starting materials. Back in 1828 chemist Friedrich Woehler reacted potassium cyanate with ammonium sulfate to create urea! Ah, there`s nothing quite like a piece of chemical trivia like that to put a sparkle in my eye! So in summary, the basic message of today’s post is that we should all get down on our knees right now and thank Dr. Woehler for inventing urea so we don’t have to worry about whether or not some stranger had to pee in our Clinique lotion in order to stop bacteria from growing in it. Or something like that.","Should you worry about pee in your makeup?","3e0843a5321622a86562a1bdc1a727a8cf705236","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2006/11/should-you-worry-about-pee-in-your-makeup/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Does Clinique Liquid Soap Cause Breakouts? by The Beauty Brains Blondie beckons… I was on Allure.com and there were several users who claimed that Clinique Liquid Facial Soap worked wonders on their face. I have used Clinique moisturizer before and it worked well with my skin, but I am skeptical about using their facial soap. I have sensitive skin and Clinique is on the more expensive side; I do not want to waste my money on something that does not work or will break me out. But I would really love to clear up the acne spots on my face. The Right Brain bounces back From our research it looks like the Clinique Liquid Facial soaps are good quality, mild cleansers although they’re a bit expensive. Let’s look at the ingredient list for the three different versions: Extra Mild, Liquid, Mild, and Oily Skin Formula. Clinique cleansers The Extra Mild type is said to contain caprylic/capric triglyceride, olive oil, and sucrose stearate to gently cleanse the skin and “potent” humectants such as sodium PCA and sodium hyaluronate to moisturize. While it’s true that these cleansers are very mild, they’re also don’t clean particularly well. You may find they don’t get your face clean enough. The humectants they mention are really marketing hype ingredients because they only work when they’re not rinsed off, which in this case they are. The Mild version is based on an amino-acid derived surfactant, TEA-Cocoyl Glutamate, which is considerably better at cleansing and still very non-stripping. It is also said to contain sodium hyaluronate, aloe, and sucrose to “help bind moisture to the skin, comfort and soothe, leaving skin refreshed and conditioned.” Again, these only have benefit when not rinsed off. Finally, the Oily skin version adds cooling menthol and a lightweight conditioner Polyquaternium-7 to its cleansers. Despite it’s positioning this cleanser doesn’t contain any acne medication. The Beauty Brains bottom line All these products would probably be good for if you’re bothered by harsh detergents but there’s always the chance that the product’s fragrance could irritate you. And Clinique won’t be good if you have a sensitive bank account. Also, while they shouldn’t make your acne any worse, there’s very little they can do to make it any better either. Finally while it doesn’t look like any of these version will dry out your skin, the ingredients that they claim are moisturizing are pretty much rinsed away, so don’t expect to much in that regard.

"The Beauty Brains","","7 reasons there aren’t more preservative free cosmetics by The Beauty Brains Here at the Beauty Brains , we get asked about preservatives in cosmetics all the time. People wonder why compounds with potential safety issues like formaldehyde or parabens are used. Should they use self-preserving cosmetics ? They also ask why cosmetic companies don’t get rid of preservatives. Wouldn’t it be great if we could? Cosmetic chemists, cosmetic manufacturers and certainly cosmetic marketers would love to get rid of preservatives. Unfortunately, the disease-causing microbes would love it too. There are some companies that offer preservative free products but not many. Here are the top reasons why more companies aren’t making preservative-free cosmetics. 7 Reasons Preservative Free Cosmetics are Rare 1. Preservative free cosmetics don’t last as long . A standard cosmetic can have a shelf life of 1 or even 2 years or more. This is great for those products you have stuffed in your medicine cabinet or bathroom drawers. You can feel confident that if you open them up tomorrow you won’t get Tetanus or Gangrene . A preservative-free cosmetic won’t last more than a couple of weeks. It’ll spoil just about as fast as milk and become dangerous. 2. Because they need to be refrigerated Unless it is put in some special packaging, preservative free cosmetics need to be refrigerated to keep them safe. You wouldn’t eat fish you left out on the counter overnight so you shouldn’t use unpreserved cosmetics that haven’t been refrigerated either. This refrigeration step is a huge inconvenience for people so manufacturers just don’t think people will want to do it. Consumer research has proven them right. 3. Because they can easily get contaminated You know how there is the common, good advice that you shouldn’t share your cosmetics with anyone? Do you know why? Because each time you use cosmetics, you expose yourself to microbial contamination. Even when there are preservatives the microbes can live in small numbers. Your body is used to your bacteria but other people may not be. Preservative free cosmetics are even more prone to contamination and can pick up any sinister microbe that happens to be floating in the air. When people get sick using cosmetics, it’s bad for product’s manufacturer. 4. Because they are more expensive to make It is possible to make preservative free cosmetics. You can use special packaging or make them anhydrous (water-free). Unfortunately, both of these options can double, triple, or quadruple the cost for manufacturing. And while most people don’t mind spending $5 on a lip balm, spending $20 for the same thing that is merely preservative free is harder to get them to accept. The other problem is that these cosmetics typically don’t work as well. They are more greasy, sticky and just less appealing. 5. Because natural preservatives don’t work as well One strategy for creating preservative free cosmetics is to use natural preservatives. Technically the products aren’t preservative free but from an advertising and legal standpoint, they are. In the EU there is a list of ingredients you can use for product preservation. If you don’t use any of those ingredients, you can call yourself “preservative free”. Unfortunately, as this article points out , natural preservatives do not work as well as the standard ones. 6. Because natural preservatives aren’t approved The article also points out the second major problem with natural preservatives. They are too expensive to get approved. A natural preservative manufacturer would have to spend millions of dollars on their new ingredient and there is no guarantee it would get on the approved list of preservatives. No company wants to take that chance. Therefore, don’t look for natural preservatives anytime soon. 7. Because preserved cosmetics are safe Probably the most important reason you don’t see more preservative free cosmetics is because the preserved products work great and are perfectly safe. True, some of the compounds used to preserve products can be nasty stuff but when used at low enough levels they are harmless. Cosmetic marketers just don’t find people willing enough to spend extra money for a benefit that is imperceptible. And if people aren’t going to buy the product, cosmetic companies aren’t going to make it. Are you concerned about preservatives in your cosmetics?

"The Beauty Brains","","Will the laser comb really help hair grow? by The Beauty Brains Jim wants to know… I’ve tried products like Scalpmed and Rogaine but none of these have worked too good. Is there anything to the laser comb from Hairmax? It says it was approved by the FDA. Right Brain reflects: Wow, this question brings back memories. When we were first starting out with the Beauty Brains , we saw a press release or advertisement and wrote this post about the Laser Comb . We were a smidge skeptical (well, Left Brain was really skeptical!) but they did have a letter from the FDA. The letter didn’t say it worked. It just said it was safe to be sold. Laser Comb Claims Indeed things have changed. Modern technology can now be used to treat hair loss. An example of which is through hair restoration surgery . More work has also been done on the laser comb. More tests. More trials. They updated their website which now claims “In January 2007, the HairMax LaserComb® became the first and only medical laser device to receive FDA Clearance to market for the “Promotion of Hair Growth” in males.” Plus they say that 93% of men in their placebo controlled, randomized clinical study showed significant increase in hair growth. They conclude that “ HairMax Laser Comb is cleared for marketing by the FDA for The Promotion of Hair Growth in males…” Guys, are you ready to get one? Not So Fast Being FDA approved was a big hurdle to clear, but it does not mean Laser Comb will work for you. In fact, the FDA recently sent Lexington International (the makers of HairMax Laser Comb ) a warning letter . Apparently, they were trying to sell the product for women’s use. They also made some after market modifications without telling the FDA. In their warning, the FDA told them… The product is not approved for anyone except males with androgenetic alopecia who have Norwood Hamilton Classifications of IIa to V and Fitzpatrick Skin Types I to IV. The Premium and SE models have not been cleared for safety This means that unless you are a male with a specific hair loss condition, you should not expect this product to work. How do you know if it might work for you? You’ll have to see a dermatologist to determine what type of hair loss you are experiencing. Should you try a Laser Comb? No doubt, some controlled studies show that the Laser Comb will work for some people. Whether you try the Laser Comb or not is up to you. The company has convinced at least some people at the FDA that some consumers benefit from using the laser comb. But not everyone as Lab Rat over at Gizmodo proved. Beauty Brains bottom line: There are thousands of products that claim hair growth, but few have FDA accepted clinical studies. Even fewer have a noticeable impact on hair growth. It is easier to prove something in a clinical study than in real life. If you have a specific type of hair loss, the Laser Comb might just work for you. Or you might be out >$500. Is the money risk worth the reward? Only you can decide. Have you tried the Laser Comb? Did it work for you or the man in your life?

"The Beauty Brains","","How to kill lice and not your hair by The Beauty Brains Sandra Scratches Her Head: I’m having a lice problem, I just wanted to know what’s the most effective way to kill lice and nits and not dry or damage my hair in the process?? Thanx!! The Left Brain ‘s Louse-y Reply: Sorry to hear about your lice infestation problem, Sandra. Unfortunately, it’s a pretty common problem. There are many other parasites that I’d prefer to have! But before I talk about a cure, here’s a bit of background for those of you who may not be familiar with this problem: Head lice are tiny crawling insects about the size of a sesame seed or smaller. They have six clawed legs that they use to crawl over your hair; they cannot hop, jump, or fly. Lice lay eggs, also known as Nits, which they glue to individual hair shafts. Lice live only on humans, not pets, and (here`s the best part) they FEED ON HUMAN BLOOD! The good news is that there several Over-The-Counter drug products that are effective against lice and nits. The bad news is, these products contain isopropyl alcohol which can dry your hair. There are “natural” lice cures but there is little or no data to prove these are effective. The safest and most sure way to get rid of lice and not damage your hair is to use a lice comb, but this is a very extremely tedious process. Recently, there was a study done by researchers at the University of Utah in which they created a steam cleaning device (a cross between a vacuum cleaner and a hair dryer) to kill lice. This could prove pretty interesting. Which treatment method is best for you? Rather than recount all the pros and cons of each method here, we’ll point you to Head Lice.org for a very through question and answer page that you should find helpful. And if you do decide to use the lice-killing shampoo please make sure you follow that with a good conditioner to counteract the drying effects of the alcohol. Good luck!","How to kill lice and not your hair","f3aa27553a11bfe8f4a8a8c879eae4021c3f4e52","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2006/11/how-to-kill-lice-and-not-your-hair/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Do eye creams really work? by The Beauty Brains Lucy longingly asks… I just bought Eyecon from Benefit, but I’m not sure if it’s really doing anything. What are eye creams and is their claim of reducing under eye circles and puffiness at all valid? What ingredients should I look for in an eye cream for these things? The Right Brain strikes an optic nerve: Do eye creams really do what they say they’ll do? Well, the answer is a little bit yes, a little bit no. All skin creams (should) moisturize. But eye creams have some added responsibilities. 1. Moisturization They’ve got to moisturize without adding a lot of heaviness or greasiness. After all, it’s likely that you’ll be apply some kind of make up around your eyes and you don’t want an eye cream to interfere with your foundation, for example. 2. Mildness They need to be extra mild, since the area around the eye is particularly sensitive to irritation. Fragrance free is best. 3. Tightening Perhaps most relevant to your question, they should tighten the skin around the eyes since they claim to reduce wrinkles. While they can’t work miracles, they can do this to some extent by adding polymers that form a film on the skin as they dry. This film can make the skin look and feel a little bit tighter. The Eyecon product you cited seems designed to do just that. It contains ingredients like Ethylene/Acrylic Acid Copolymer, Butylene Glycol, Glyceryl Polymethacrylate, and Sodium Polyacrylate. These are all film forming agents that can help eyes feel less puffy and look less wrinkled. Of course the effect varies from person to person; even in best case scenarios it may not be dramatically noticible; and even if it does work it’s only a temporary fix at best. But if you notice enough difference you might want to continue using the product. Want another opinion? Paula Begoun, the Cosmetic Cop, has a much harsher opinion of eye creams . She says that they are no different from facial moisturizers and that they are “a whim of the cosmetics industry designed to evoke the sale of two products when only one is needed.” Meow! The Beauty Brains bottom line: Eye creams are essentially moisturizers that are modified for use on the thin skin around the eyes. While they don’t work miracles like they claim, they do contain ingredients that may offer some temporary benefit. We say: try it and see what you think. But as always, let the buyer beware.","Do eye creams really work?","234b3d379a89e0319e2b411d28331ac708d69738","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2010/04/do-eye-creams-really-work/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Are Sunscreens Bad for the Environment? by The Beauty Brains Sandy says: I was reading this article at National Geographic and wondered what kind of sunscreen you recommend that won’t kill the coral reefs. Can you help? And is this really a problem? Right Brain retorts: Who doesn’t love the colorful and diverse ecosystem found at coral reefs? Even a logician like Left Brain can appreciate the beauty of these sites. Unfortunately, coral reefs are dying around the world . There are a variety of reasons like coastal development, overfishing, pollution and global climate change which individuals have little ability to change. However, the article you cite says some environmental scientists think the sunscreen you use may also be killing these systems. Death by sunscreen According to a recent paper published in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives , certain sunscreen ingredients have been shown to cause destruction of the coral reefs. In their experiments, they showed that chemicals like parabens, ethylhexylmethoxycinnamate, benzophenone-3 and 4-methylbenzylidene camphor induce a viral infection of algae living in the corals which leads to bleaching. The authors go on to say that 4000 – 6000 tons of sunscreen is washed off beach goers annually and that this may be part of the problem. They recommend avoiding sunscreens that contain ingredients harmful to coral. Not all scientists are convinced While most of the media will report this as definitive news, some scientists question the conclusions made by this limited study. Specifically, they have four primary criticisms. Concentration issues . The amount of chemicals shown to have an effect is over 10x that which is likely to occur in seawater around reefs. No detection . They didn’t actually test the water near coral reefs for sunscreen chemicals. No correlations . Researchers haven’t shown a correlation between popular sunbathing/snorkeling reefs and bleaching levels. If it were a problem caused by people’s sunscreens, places with more people would have more bleaching than those with less. They don’t. Forgot pollution . They also forgot that the same chemicals are found in other personal care products that get washed down the drain and eventually end up in the ocean. Sunscreen use may be a much smaller contributor. So, your sunscreen use may not be as much of a problem as the original paper’s authors suggest. Don’t you just love science? Beauty Brains bottom line: Right now there is not enough information to tell whether sunscreens are really killing coral reefs. The effect is probably overblown in this paper. However, there is proof that some ingredients can theoretically harm them, so if you want to remove this as a concern for you, avoid sunscreens that contain the following (if you’re going anywhere near a coral reef). Butylparaben Methylparaben Ethylhexylmethoxycinnamate Benzophenone-3 4-methylbenzylidene camphor Instead, consider using products that contain zinc oxide or titanium dioxide .","Are Sunscreens Bad for the Environment?","d41722a0235d73b98ea9bc280f791fe482b37184","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2008/04/are-sunscreens-bad-for-the-environment/"
"Randy Schueller","","5 ways to reduce enlarged pores by Randy Schueller Jess Just Wants To Know: I have had large pores for as long as I remember and have some spa days coming up so I want to know what products really work to shrink facial pores? The Beauty Brains reply: Unfortunately, none. At first glance, you may think that pore control products offer to make your pores smaller, but if you read the label carefully you’ll see that in most cases they just claim to reduce the appearance of large pores. That may sound like a subtle distinction but it’s really not. There’s not much you can do to physically make your pores smaller but you can avoid making them look larger. Instead of looking for “shrinking” products, try avoiding these 5 factors that can make pores look plump: 1. Skin debris … …like dead skin cells can collect in pores making them appear bigger. Good facial cleansing is key to staying debris-free. 2. Excessive oiliness … …can keep pores filled with a layer of oil that accentuates their appearance. Consider using oil-absorbing makeup or more frequent cleansing or blotting. 3. Bacterial growth… …contribute to blackheads and make pores appear freakishly huge. Exfolliation can help. 4. Sun exposure… … can thicken the skin cells around the edge of pores making them appear larger. Using a sunscreen or limiting your sun exposure is a good idea. 5. Genetics … …determines your skin type and if you`re unlucky enough to be born with oily, thicker skin your pores will probably be more noticeable. Changing your parents could help this but is probably not a very practical solution.","5 ways to reduce enlarged pores","f41e1155659cbf276ee5ffb63dd4594cba97b710","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2006/11/5-ways-to-reduce-enlarged-pores/"

"The Beauty Brains","","Hair color hacks: tricks to color your roots by The Beauty Brains Mandy asks: Whenever I dye my hair either at home or at a salon, my roots never catch the colour. Do you have any ideas why? Left Brain says: This is an interesting question Mandy. I’m assuming you’ve considered and rejected the obvious answer that you are not putting enough coloring paste on the hair at the roots. This is understandable because you are encouraged not to get any chemicals on your scalp. But beyond this, the most likely reason your roots aren’t taking up color is that they are just too “healthy” or undamaged. Let me explain. How hair grows First, you have to know a little about hair growth. Hair grows by pushing its way out of the hair follicle onto your head. It’s a bit like one of those Play-Doh factory sets where you squeeze the putty through a small hole. So, the newest hair is closest to the scalp. When hair is exposed to things like UV, heat, combing, shampooing, wind, etc. it becomes damaged. And while damaged hair doesn’t look or feel as good as less damaged hair, it does have one significant advantage. It is easier to color. Why? Read on. Damaged hair colors easier When you color hair, part of the process involves chemically loosening the outer layer (cuticle) so the color chemicals can get inside. It turns out to be much easier to loosen damaged cuticle layers. New, undamaged hair, such as the kind found at your roots, has a much stronger outer layer and does not loosen up enough to let as many color molecules in. When the color molecules can’t get into the hair, they can’t change the hair color. **Warning: Try the following tips at your own risk. You could end up with a hair color you did not want. Tips for coloring the roots If the warning didn’t scare you, then feel free to try either of these 2 things to get more color on your roots. 1. Leave it on longer. Leave the color solution on the roots for a longer period of time before rinsing it out. So, if the time on the box says 20 minutes, leave it on your roots for 30 minutes. This will give the chemicals more time to get into the hair. 2. Color the roots twice. If the first method isn’t successful, try this. The first time you do the coloring process, just follow the directions as normal, but save a small part of the solution (don’t even mix it together) to use for later. After you’ve finished coloring, combine the remaining solution and color the roots a second time. This double process should damage the hair enough to get it to absorb enough color. Everyone’s hair is different so you’ll have to experiment with how long to leave the color on. Beauty Brains Bottom Line: Coloring your roots is harder but it is possible. You just need to do things a little different and be prepared for some unexpected results.","Hair color hacks: tricks to color your roots","a9d2f19b8bf6a40dcb0666bbf23138c17e33ef3c","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2008/04/hair-color-hacks-tricks-to-color-your-roots/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Legitimate eyelash growth enhancer coming to a store near you by The Beauty Brains Remember back when the Beauty Brains told you about a company developing a legitimate product for improving eyelash growth ? Well, that product is one step closer to reality, now that the FDA has confirmed a bimatoprost derivative appears to increase eyelash length and thickness. (You can read the entire 108 page report here ). Eyelash Growth Proof In the study cited by the FDA, 78% of people showed an improvement versus 18% of people using a placebo control. Also, only 4 subjects in the 278 person trial reported eye problems. This is the kind of evidence that was lacking with the Jan Marini Eyelash product . The fact that bimatoprost was a patented ingredient by Allergan also had something to do with Jan Marini’s troubles. When Can you get Latisse? Allergan still has some hoops to jump through, but once a panel of independent medical experts vote on the new product, it’s as good as approved. Since it is a drug, the product, called Latisse, will only be available through prescription. That should be sometime during 2009. -Mid Brain What have you used to make your eyelashes longer?

"The Beauty Brains","","Mascara isn’t the only thing on your lashes by The Beauty Brains Here’s a bit of science information from the Beauty Brains that you might find interesting on a Saturday afternoon. There are tiny little animals called demodex mites that live on your face and eyelashes. These mites are not pretty to look at but they do the excellent service of keeping the bits of dead skin cells off your lashes and face. People have thought that these creatures are responsible for causing acne but that’s a myth. Demodex mites do not cause acne or any other hair or skin conditions. If you get enough of them they can cause itching. However, this is a rare event indeed. So the next time you’re coating your lovely lashes, think about all the microscopic mites that help keep your body clean.","Mascara isn’t the only thing on your lashes","ab523af5c78c8098c8aa50c547fa3fe9ddfa887f","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2006/11/mascara-isnt-the-only-thing-on-your-lashes/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Should you keep lipstick in the refrigerator? by The Beauty Brains Veuve asks… Since I have a lot of lipstick and it seems to be one of the cosmetics that goes bad relatively quickly, I was wondering if keeping it in the refrigerator or freezer would help it last longer. Or would the moisture/cold do something nasty to the oils or pigments? The Left Brain responds: Good question, Veuve. Making your cosmetics last longer is a great way to save money. Low temp lipstick When it comes to making cosmetics last longer, lower temperature is generally better. That’s because chemical reactions occur faster at higher temperatures. (A rough rule of thumb is that the rate of any given reaction will double with every 10C increase in temperature.) Lipsticks are prone to oxidation reactions that can turn certain oils rancid and keeping your sticks in the ‘fridge can slow down that process. The only potential problem that may occur is that you may see beads of “sweat” on the stick. These are drops of oil coming out of the wax matrix and rising to the surface of the stick. This is a phenomena known as “syneresis.” If too much of this sweating occurs, the lipstick won’t spread properly on your lips. By the way, the idea of cooling cosmetics to prolong their shelf life is not a new one. In fact, one enterprising inventor has even patented a refrigerated makeup bag so you can chill on the go. It’s an airtight handbag with a pocket on the top panel where you insert frozen gel packs that keep your lipsticks and other makeup protected from heat. What do YOU think? Do you refrigerate your cosmetics to protect them?

"The Beauty Brains","","Is ren skincare really skin friendly? by The Beauty Brains Kimberly’s inquiry: A somewhat new to US product has caught my discerning eye – it is REN out of England it professes to be pure (REN is “pure” in Norwegian or something) and free of toxins like parabens, mineral oil, petrochemicals, dyes, and silicones. Please give me the lowdown, as you see it. Thank you so very much, luv your website yu ROK. The Right Brain’s REN response: Thanks for the kind words, Kimberly. I’ve always secretly considered myself the hardest rocking Beauty Brain. Here’s our take on REN. Scare tactics First of all, as regular readers of our site know, we’re not big fans of any company that tries to sell products based scare tactics. REN’s website says their products are free of skin-unfriendly ingredients and potential irritants like the ones you sited above, yet in reality, many of the ingredients they avoid have NOT been proven to cause problems. (Mineral oil is a good example.) But setting aside the ethics issue for the moment, let’s see how REN lives up to their promise of avoiding “nasty” ingredients. We’ll look at their Day Serum as an example. Revivo-Lift Day Serum ($75 for 1 ounce) Rosa Damascena Flower Water, Glycerin (Source Coconut Oil), Argania Spinosa (Argan) Kernel Extract, Sodium Cocoyl Glutamate (Source Coconut), Rosa Canina (Rosehip) Seed Oil, Palmitoyl Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Cetearyl Olivate (Source Olive Oil), Sorbitan Oilivate (Source Olive Oil), Vaccinium Vitis-Idaea (Lingonberry) Seed Oil, Ascorbyl Tetraisopalmitate (Vitamin C), Zostera marina Pectin (Source Sea Grass), Hydrolyzed Glycosaminoglycans (Source Corn), Gynostemma Pentaphyllum (Jiaogulan) Leaf Extract, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Magnesium Aspartate, Zinc Gluconate, Copper Gluconate, Phenoxyethanol (Source Aromatic Ether), Sodium Hydroxymethylglycinate (Source Amino Acids), Citrus Grandis (Grapefruit) Seed Extract, Xanthan Gum (Source Corn), Carbomer (Source Polymer), Parfum (100% natural fragrance), Linalool, Limonene, Farnesol, Faex (Yeast) Extract, Tocopherol (Vitamin E). Formula base By listing “rose water” as the first ingredient, REN is implying that there’s no added water in the product. At best, this is a stretch of the labeling laws which state that the first ingredient should be the one present at the highest concentration, which in this case is “water” not “Rose water.” Thickener/Stabilizer Carbopol is an acrylic polymer used to thicken and stabilize emulsions. It’s a perfectly fine ingredient but it’s about as far from natural as it gets in the cosmetic world. It’s a surprising choice for REN. Fragrance Here’s a fact that you might not know about fragrance: companies are now required to list any known allergens contained in the fragrances they use. And if you take a look at the bottom of the Day Serum ingredient list, you’ll see two chemicals listed after “Parfum (100% natural fragrance).” These chemicals are linalool and limonene and they’re listed because they are both known fragrance allergens. If REN was really avoiding skin unfriendly ingredients you think they would avoide fragrances with known allergens. Preservative According to REN’s website , Good Housekeeping states their products are preservative free. But that’s not true in the case of this Day Serum because it contains phenoxyethanol a common preservative in the cosmetic industry. While it’s not as effective a parabens or DMDM hydantoin, Cosmetic chemists like to use it because it provides a rose like odor that helps cover the odor the other ingredients. The Beauty Brains bottom line REN has some lovely formulations and it appears that, for the most part, they’ve gone out of their way to avoid ingredients that people THINK are bad for their skin. But their approach of charging exorbitant prices for their scare tactics doesn’t sit well with us. If you’re concerned enough to pay more money to avoid ingredients that haven’t been proven harmful, then REN products may be perfect for you. But we think you can get more value for your money elsewhere. What do YOU think? Are you queasy about chemicals? Do you pay more for brands that are “safer?” Leave a comment and share your scare with the rest of the Beauty Brains community.","Is ren skincare really skin friendly?","ab96396d9acab5fef111046961cb2c84f9293f08","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2008/04/is-ren-skincare-really-skin-friendly/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Will syn-ake venom smooth your wrinkles? by The Beauty Brains Chris queries… I’ve seen several high end beauty lines that charge a small fortune for face creams that contain this synthetic snake venom, revered as the new Botox, sans injections. they claim it works just as well, albeit a bit slower since it requires multiple applications of the cream to see results. So my questions are: does this stuff really work? if so, how does one know how much is needed for the product to actually work? meaning is there a recognized minimum concentration needed for the claims to be true. I know that with some ingredients in creams, if they are below a certain % of the product, you are wasting your money since there’s not enough in there to do what the product claims it does. Left Brain is venomous We had previously written about snake venom in skin lotion because Gwyneth Paltrow supposedly was using it . Then a cosmetic raw material sales rep passed along the attached sell sheet about Syn-Ake . (A Beauty Brains commenter was kind enough to get us the link). What is Syn-ake? Syn-ake is an anti-wrinkle material based on a synthetic tripeptide that “mimics” the effects of a peptide found in the venom of the Temple Viper snake. It was created by Pentapharm Ltd, a Swiss based chemical company. Reportedly, they are the largest snake breeders and keepers in the world too. What does Syn-ake do? According to the company literature, Syn-ake acts in a manner similar to a peptide in snake venom. It supposedly blocks some receptor and keeps muscles relaxed. This is supposed to smooth out your wrinkles. The relaxation of muscles is also how Botox is supposed to work. Does it really work? In the chemical sell sheet, data is presented from 2 studies. The first suggests that Syn-ake can reduce muscle cell contractions in a laboratory test. That’s not in people but in a cell culture of muscle cells. The second study shows that after 28 days of using a Syn-ake laced cream, you get a shrinkage of up to 52% of wrinkle. That must mean something, right? Well, maybe not. Problems with the Study The data presented as proof that Syn-ake works raises a number of questions. For example, What was the placebo that Syn-ake was compared to? Where is the proof that Syn-ake penetrates to the lower layers of the dermis where it might possibly have an effect? How does the performance compare to Botox or any other anti-wrinkle treatment? How many subjects were tested? Who did the testing and was it blinded? I could go on but there’s really no point. The data presented here is incomplete and not useful for drawing conclusions. A quick search of the medical literature revealed that there were no peer reviewed studies of this ingredient. With such thin data and such incredible claims, I remain skeptical. Then you have to add in the Marketing speak that runs throughout their press materials. Notice they don’t claim that Syn-ake is a peptide found in snake venom. It only says that it “mimics the effect” of a peptide found in snake venom. It also says Syn-ake “acts in a manner similar to that of Waglerin 1″ (the compound in snake venom shown to block the acetylcholine receptor). “Mimics” and “Similar to” are weasel words that cosmetic marketing companies use when they want to create the impression that two things are related even when they aren’t. You could say body wash mimics soap but that doesn’t mean they are the same thing. The Beauty Brains bottom line There is no credible evidence that this material works as well as Botox no matter how much you put on your wrinkles. If you want the effectiveness of Botox, save up your money for Botox. Snake venom creams just will not be as effective. And if you’re looking for an effective anti-wrinkle treatment, try out some of the products that were tested in this skin study . Chris’ question was originally posted on the Beauty Brains forum . If you’d like to ask a question, sign up for the forum today and ask the Beauty Brains.","Will syn-ake venom smooth your wrinkles?","29475293bf0adb9e1fc6e0629374839ee8133eb2","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2008/12/will-syn-ake-venom-smooth-your-wrinkles/"
"Perry Romanowski","","How to get rid of shaving bumps and ingrown hairs by Perry Romanowski Jincy Wants The Juice: I am dealing with a frequent problem of having ingrown hair after waxing my legs, arms and even my underarms. I don’t know what to do about it. I have tried using a scrubber, moisturizing cream to remove it, but this is just getting worse every time I wax. Now, my legs are looking terrible due to these skin problems, could you help? The Right Brain Responds: While we’re not doctors, we do watch a lot of medical TV shows so we feel well qualified to answer your question. Seriously, it sounds like you have a case of folliculitis – a condition in which the hair follicle becomes inflamed and irritated. This condition occurs a lot with men when they shave their face. It can also occur on other parts of the body, like the legs. If you click the link you can read more about this condition but if you do, please scroll down past the pictures of buttock folliculitis very fast. You’ll be glad you did. The best treatment is to let your leg hairs grow out to give your follicles a chance to recover. And we recommend picking up a couple of pints of Ben and Jerry’s Chunky Monkey and renting Season 1 of Grey’s Anatomy since you won’t be going out in public much. Just kidding. Really, you should get Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough. But all joking about ice cream and lack of social contact aside, you do need to give your follicles a rest. If you HAVE to do something, shave instead of waxing for a while. That’s less irritating to the follicle.","How to get rid of shaving bumps and ingrown hairs","4fd26cd6c8a64aefb6913e4fe7af23d2d094f303","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2006/11/how-to-get-rid-of-shaving-bumps-and-ingrown-hairs/"
"The Beauty Brains","","How to pick a good face wash by The Beauty Brains Slique says: Is it true that Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS) in facial cleansers is bad for your skin? I find that whenever I use a cleanser with SLS my skin will feel a lil’ bit dry. The Right Brain responds: Sodium Lauryl Sulfate and its cousin Sodium Laureth Ether Sulfate (SLES) are favorite topics here on the Beauty Brains. We’ve blogged before about how they are good cleaners, but they can dry your skin if you’re not careful. Does that make sulfate based products bad? Not necessarily, because it depends on what else is in the formula. A well formulated product that uses sulfates in combination with milder surfactants or with conditioning agents that prevent the skin from becoming too stripped, are perfectly fine for most people. So that made us curious – how many face washes DO use sulfates? A quick trip to Drugstore.com shows that none of the top ten brands used SLS, but we did notice that 7 of these 10 used other sulfates to some degree. So if you’re looking for sulfate free and you want to pick a good face wash, here’s the list of ten face washes ranked from least expensive to most expensive (based on cost per ounce) with all the cleansing agents spelled out . Skin Milk Face Wash – contains little sulfates Cost: $0.66/oz Surfactants: Stearic Acid based soap, Glycereth 26, Cocamide DEA, Sodium Laureth 13 Carboxylate, PEG 100 Stearate, Sodium Laureth Sulfate Comments: Stearic acid soaps give a whipped creamy kind of foam. Olay Foaming Face Wash for Sensitive Skin – contains little sulfates Cost: $0.75/0z Surfactants: Sodium Myristoyl Sarcosinate, PEG 120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate, Sodium Lauroamphoacetate, Disodium Lauroamphodiacetate, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Cocamide MEA Comments : A surprisingly low cost formula considering the range of mild surfactants. Seabreeze Naturals Foaming Face Wash – contains a lot of sulfates Cost: $0.75/oz Surfactants: Sodium Laureth Sulfate, PEG 120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate Comments: Basis Clean Face Wash – contains a lot of sulfates Cost: $0.92/oz Surfactants: Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Lauryl Glucoside, PEG 7 Glyceryl Cocoate, Sodium Cocoyl Glutamate, PEG 8, Glyceryl Laurate, PEG 200 Hydrogenated Glyceryl Palmate, Comments: The combination of betaine and laureth sulfate is one of the most popular mixtures for shampoos. Neutrogena Deep Clean Facial Cleanser – contains sulfonates, not sulfates Cost: $1.08/oz Surfactants: Sodium C14-16 Olefin Sulfonate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium C12-15 Pareth-15 Sulfonate Comments: This formula will certainly deep clean since it uses sulfonates, a class of surfactants as stripping, if not more stipping, than any of the sulfates. Purpose Gentle Cleansing Wash – contains moderate sulfates Cost: $1.08/oz Surfactants: PEG 80 Sorbitan Laurate, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Comments: This is essentially a baby shampoo formula. Desert Essence Thoroughly Clean Face Wash – contains no sulfates Cost: $1.15/oz Surfactants: Castile Soap Comments: No sulfates to be found but pure soap can also be drying to the skin. Nature’s Gate Deep Cleansing Foaming Face Wash – contains a lot of sulfates Cost: $1.20/oz Surfactants: Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Cocamide MIPA, Comments: Biore Pore Minimizing Foaming Face Wash – contains moderate sulfates Cost: $1.66/oz Surfactants: Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Isethionate, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Decyl Glucoside, Cocamidopropyl Betaine Comments: Isethionates are very rich foaming and mild to the skin. Kiss My Face Organics Jump Start Exfolliating Face Wash – contains no sulfates Cost: $3.25/oz Surfactants: Decyl Glucoside Comments: A mild, corn based cleanser but certainly not worth almost 3 times more than Biore, the next most expensive product.

My mother-in-law is a “beauty consultant” for BeautiControl and they seem to have a pretty extensive line of skin care products. Do you know anything about the quality of their line (I’m looking mainly at cleansers, toners, anti-aging products and moisturizers) and/or can you recommend any of their products? The Left Brain Lashes Out: I’m surprised anyone can afford Arbonne ! Just kidding. Based on what I’ve seen, the Beauticontrol products seem to be of reasonable quality. They’re also very pricey, but if you afford them, that’s your decision. What bugs me, and the reason that I would not recommend them, is the way the company hypes their products. I understand the need for creative marketing, but when a company makes statements that border on untrue, that disturbs me. I just hate being lied to and I REALLY hate being lied to under the guise of science. To me there’s at least 3 tip offs when a company is stretching the truth about their products. Let me give you some examples using Beauticontrol: Lie #1: Claims of Exclusivity What’s the lie – they tell that “only” their products can give you a certain benefit. What’s the truth – the truth is, unless they have a patent or a documented trade secret, they’re using the same technology as everyone else in the industry. What’s the example -Beauticontrol says “only BeautiControl offers comprehensive, customized skin care that addresses what your skin needs¦when it needs it.” Based on their product catalog they appear to have typical cleansers, toners, lotions, etc. that are offered by many, many other companies. Why do they say “only” Beauticontrol offers this kind of treatment? Lie #2: Implying Superior Performance without Substantiation What’s the lie – they tell you their product works better than anyone else’s. What’s the truth – if they make claims like that they’d better have some kind of proof. What’s the example – Beauticontrol says “Far beyond traditional dry, combination and oily skin care, BeautiControl takes an innovative, personal approach, to provide total skin wellness through¦” Blah, blah blah. Again, with conventional products there is no way they can convince me that their products are far beyond traditional ones. Yes, they may be applying a different marketing spin, but there is no technology muscle behind their mouth. Lie #3: “Magic” Ingredient Claims What’s the lie – they say that some sexy sounding ingredient makes the product work. What’s the truth – in reality, most of the time it’s the formula as a whole and not any single ingredient that makes the product work. What’s the example – Beauticontrol says one of their products is “formulated with the rejuvenating minerals of the Dead Sea.” Minerals don’t rejuvenate skin, moisturizing agents do. Ok, now that I’ve gotten that out of my system, maybe Beauticontrol isn’t “lying” to us (I’m going to catch hell from the Right Brain for this post!) but they certainly are overstating the uniqueness of their line. And as a scientist, that kind of hype turns me off. For more about Arbonne products see this post.","The 3 biggest lies that cosmetic companies tell you","0d2b008701b8e370251778bf153c95209c749a6a","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2006/11/the-3-biggest-lies-that-cosmetic-companies-tell-you/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Will silicones dry out hair? by The Beauty Brains Summer says about silicones… I am an esthetician and an absolute ingredient crazy beauty product junkie. My question for you is whether or not silicone in any of its forms is drying and therefore damaging to the hair. My hair stylist told me that it dries hair out, resulting in the breakage I have always experienced. As a curly haired woman living in humidity, silicones have saved me from much unnecessary frizz. Please clarify what effect silicones have on hair, and also skin if you could, as I was taught that they formed a protective layer over the skin holding in the skin’s natural moisture (as well as imparting a silky feel to the surface). The Right Brain’s silky smooth reply: Good for your Summer! You’re not blindly following the advice of your hair stylist! Savvy about silicone The truth is, silicone (the molecule pictured above) is one of the MOST effective ingredients for conditioning hair or skin. In both cases it serves as a protective barrier. In fact, in skin lotions dimethicone (a form of silicone) is so good it’s approved as an over the counter drug ingredient. In hair care products you’ll see a mixture of dimethicone and cyclomethicone typically used. Again, dimethicone is heavier and coats the hair; cyclomethicone is very thin and helps to spread the dimethicone, it also evaporates so it’s good for use in lightweight products like leave in conditioners or volumizing products. The Beauty Brains bottom line Silicones are good moisturizers for hair and skin and are commonly used in many, many products. We’ve never seen any data that shows they dry out or damage hair.","Will silicones dry out hair?","f1bf6fd10f8aaa311b26762828df5284f0068089","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2010/05/will-silicones-dry-out-hair/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Are you making this mistake when you wash your face? by The Beauty Brains Sherry’s peroxide predicament: I have extremely oily skin and have experimented over the years with several different face washes in an attempt to find one that cleanses deeply without over-drying. I have discovered that botanical based gel washes followed by a moisturizer rich in dimethicone work best in my case. I have also discovered that mixing in a little hydrogen peroxide with my face wash works even better. It completely removes any traces of excess oil and makeup without drying me out completely, and it’s completely eliminated my occasional breakouts. I’ve been using this cocktail with great results for a few years now with no problem. Is this safe for my skin? Fore Brain’s free radical reply: Sherry, it seems that most of the ingredients in your skin regimen are quite safe with possible exception of hydrogen peroxide. Although not totally conclusive, scientific evidence points to the fact that long term use of hydrogen peroxide on your face may result in skin damage. The quick answer is that if you are concerned about wrinkles and skin damage, hydrogen peroxide may not be for you. A little about hydrogen peroxide Hydrogen Peroxide (aka H2O2) is the liquid you get in a brown opaque bottle at the pharmacy, and for years has been used for all sorts of bleaching as well as an antiseptic to clean wounds. However, as of a few years ago, this practice has been discontinued since hydrogen peroxide was deemed too harsh for wound treatment. This is probably indication that it can’t be that good for your face either. The primary concern with hydrogen peroxide is its oxidative effect when it contacts other materials. The oxidation is what kills the bacteria; however, as per recent discoveries in free radicals and skin damage, it may also result in skin cell destruction and premature skin ageing. The free radical theories can get pretty complicated but I’ll try to explain it in simple terms. Free radicals are just lonely A molecule like hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is basically a water (H2O) combined with an oxygen (O) and it takes energy to hold that extra oxygen molecule onto the whole structure for several chemistry-related reasons that are too advanced for the scope of this article. The bottom line is, when the hydrogen peroxide molecule touches other materials, it gets a chance to fall apart to a more relaxed state of H2O (water) and the O (oxygen) that it nearly always takes. The problem however, is that oxygen molecules like to travel in pairs, and the newly released oxygen molecule will look for another oxygen to attach itself to. While the oxygen molecule is alone and looking for its pair, it is quite unbalanced, and can result in damage to the cells, DNA, as well as other cell components. The lone oxygen molecule looking for its partner is an example of a free radical. Unfortunately, according to this theory, when we apply hydrogen peroxide to our skin, on a very tiny molecular level, it breaks down into water and the lone oxygen molecule that causes damage to the skin cells resulting in premature aging. (This kind of damage also happens normally with time from effects of the sun or the environment.) The Beauty Brains bottom line So is an acne spot treatment of hydrogen peroxide once in a while going to ruin your skin? Probably not. However, long-term use over large areas of skin (ie. your whole face), is something I wouldn’t recommend if you want your skin to stay healthy for a long time. If you do want some tips on how to manage your oily skin without the use hydrogen peroxide, check out this site . Fun Fact: Highly concentrated hydrogen peroxide is often used in rocket fuel because of its oxygenating abilities!

I’ve noticed that a lot of them include very similar ingredients, like jojoba oil, apricot kernel oil, shea butter, and in particular sweet almond oil and lavender oil. Do these ingredients really help to moisturize and what exactly do they do? I’ve noticed a lot of body care products emphasize shea butter. I’ve also noticed them some body lotions have coconut oil in it, is this another beneficial ingredient? The Right Brain Responds: All the oils you mentioned can moisturize skin – but they’re not the BEST moisturizers. What are the best, you ask? Ah, that is the question. But first you have to sit through this quick explanation: How Oils Moisturize Moisture evaporates from your skin by slipping though tiny cracks and fissures. Oils form a barrier layer on top of the skin that prevents the water molecules from escaping. It’s all about stopping evaporation! This property is called occlusivity and it’s measured by a rating called Transepidermal Water Loss, or TEWL. (pronounced “tool.”) The TEWL value has been measured for various oils, and the ones that have the highest rating (in other words, the ones that stop the most water from escaping your skin) are as follows: 1. Petroleum jelly (in a minimum concentration of 5%, reduces TEWL by more than 98%) 2. Lanolin 3. Mineral oil 4. Dimethicone a type of silicone 5. Coconut Oil and Others including other oils (like coconut oil ), fatty alcohols, and waxes Some of the other oils you mentioned are still beneficial – they can make skin feel softer and smoother. But if really want to keep your skin moist, you need to reduce evaporation with one of these top 5.","The world’s top 5 skin moisturizing oils","0588b7f3e4f9168675d914d43d8f46c3a7395460","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2006/10/the-worlds-top-5-skin-moisturizing-oils/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Unwanted Hair? Try Licorice! by The Beauty Brains Vdot wants to know… The Epilar System claims to be a topical product that, when used in a series of 8-12 treatments spaced 5-6 weeks apart, can inhibit hair regrowth. Looking at the ingredients, I think the jury is still out on whether Trypsin (it’s an enzyme, right?) is a hair growth inhibitor. Thoughts on the ingredient combo here, and is it junk or worth a try for those of us who have to keep up with our girl ‘staches weekly? The Right Brain responds: We have an answer for you Vdot, sort of. While we haven’t had a chance to research Trypsin as a hair growth inhibitor we did just come across an article describing the discovery that licorice extract can effectively inhibit hair growth. Hair growth inhibitor According to the Dermatology Times , a study conducted at University Hospital, J. W. Goethe University in Frankfurt, Germany has shown that an active compound extracted from licorice (glycyrrhizic acid) stopping hair growth in rats. Do you girls realize what this means??? That’s right, the garbage dumps and sewers in large urban areas will soon be over run by bald rats! And then they’ll need some sort of Mouse Minoxidil to counteract their rodential smoothness. And, oh yeah, it might also mean that Vdot can stop shaving her “girl ‘stache.” All kidding aside, this discovery could be a breakthrough in controlling unwanted hair. The researchers found that after only three days of treatment the rats showed some reduction in hair growth and after a week or two their skin was almost as smooth as a baby’s butt. Better still, there was no sign of skin irritation or other side effects that hair removal/growth inhibiting products can cause. The scientists theorize that licorice extract works by causing the hair shaft to detach from the follicular wall. Only time will tell if this discovery is better than the Epilar system. In the meantime, watch out for those hairless rats! How do YOU deal with unwanted hair? Leave a comment and share your tricks and tips with the rest of the Beauty Brains community.","Unwanted Hair?

"The Beauty Brains","","How does volumizing mousse work? by The Beauty Brains Lejla must know mousse: I have fine hair and have been using the Sebastian Body Double Thickify Styler which is a volume mousse. I like the way it makes my hair feel more stiff and sturdy. But why does it say I need to blow dry my hair for it to work? Isn’t that damaging? I’ve also used the more affordable Tresemme “Volume & Lift” mousse, but I just don’t seem to get the same effect. Why not? The Right Brain replies: Lejla, good questions. Hopefully the following mousse manifesto will provide some helpful answers. History of mousse Like Champagne, mousse is an invention of the French. The fluffy foam was introduced in Europe (by L’Oreal) in the early 1980s and brought to the US a few years later by Tresemme. Over the last 20 years, mousse has grown to be one of the top styling forms along side hairspray and gel. Types of mousse There are many kinds of mousse but they all have one thing in common: foam. They may be formulated to provide hold or conditioning and they can be packaged in aerosol or nonaerosol containers. Traditionally, true mousses are aerosols while the nonaerosol type may go by other names like “foam stylers.” Mousses are used to give hair volume and they’re generally combined with some kind of finishing spray to lock the hair into place. Ingredients Solvents Water and alcohol are used to disperse the other ingredients in the formula. (Many mousses are now alcohol free.) Propellant The gaseous stuff that pushes the product out of the can. This gas is also what causes the liquid mousse to turn all foamy. Only in aerosol mousses, like the Tresemme product you asked about have propellant. The Body Double product is a non-aerosol mousse that uses a pump to create foam instead of aerosol propellant. There’s no propellant to worry about but the foam is not as rich. Hold and conditioning agents These ingredients have the most effect on your hair. They’re a combination of hairspray-like polymers, oils, and other smoothing agents that coat the hair shaft. For example, Sebastian’s Body Double uses VP/VA copolymer, cetrimonium chloride, polyquaternium-10, polyquaternium-37, and amodimethicone. On the other hand Tresemmé “Volume & Lift” uses these: acrylates copolymer, VP/VA copolymer, polyquaternium-4, peg-12 dimethicone, amodimethicone, peg-40 hydrogenated castor oil, and cetrimonium chloride. Control agents Sets the pH, helps with product stability, and preserves against microbial bugs. Fragrance Pretty much what you’d expect – smells pretty. How Mousse works Mousse is usually worked through damp hair. As it dries, the polymers and other coating agents set up a film on your hair strands. Unlike hairsprays that “glue” different hair fibers together, mousse is meant to coat each fiber to give it some stiffness. As the film dries, each hair pushes out against the hair next to it so overall your hair is left with more volume. Depending on the type of mousse, your hair can feel very conditioned or stiff and crunchy. (That’s the kind of difference you see between Sebastian and Tresemme.) Depending on the formula and the amount of hair you have, blow drying may be necessary to get the style that you like. And yes, blow drying can be damaging. It’s a sacrifice you may have to make to get your hair to look like you want it to.","How does volumizing mousse work?","99a8a9e4059f50baf17ca7a431dd2729a9aae8df","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2008/04/how-does-volumizing-mousse-work/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Does Hylexin really work on dark undereye circles? by The Beauty Brains Etienne Inquires: I love your blog because it is so informative and a great unbiased resource when trying to be a smart shopper. I have looked through your archives but I haven’t come across a post that directly addresses my problem: serious dark circles around my eyes. I have had these ever since I was a kid, so it has nothing to do with my lifestyle or the amount of sleep I get (though allergies do play a role). Do you recommend any creams or gels in particular? I have seen advertisements for expensive ones like Hylexin; I would be willing to pay the price if I knew that they were effective. Just to clarify, my problem isn’t necessarily puffiness or dryness, but primarily the dark coloration in the eye orbit (it looks like I have black eyes). Is there any product short of a good concealer that will help me out? The Right Brain Responds: Thanks for the kind works Etienne. We looked into this Hylexin product and found that their website does a pretty good job of explaining what causes those dark circles in the first place. And we quote Bremenn Labs, makers of Hylexin : Serious dark circles (the kind that make you look old, tired and exhausted) are about, of all things, the oxidation of hemoglobin (blood) in the capillary matrix of the peri-orbital eye area. What a mouthful! These capillaries actually “leak” blood that begins to oxidize (through a process called hemoglobin degradation)… creating a dark bluish-red pigmentation that looks distinctly like an ugly bruise. What does all that mean in plain English? Tiny little capillaries deposit blood around your sensitive eye area. The blood turns deep purple and you end up looking like you just went 12 hard rounds in a boxing ring. Ok, so now you know what causes your dark circles. But what will get rid of them? The American Academy Of Dermatologists says that Vitamin K has been shown to have some effect on reducing facial bruising, which is caused by a similar type of blood leakage. So a Vitamin K based product might help reduce under eye circles. But Hylexin doesn’t contain Vitamin K . Hmmm. So does this stuff work? We can’t be sure, but we did find out that Bremmen labs has been reported to the Federal Trade Commission for making unsubstantiated claims on Hylexin. While this doesn’t necessarily mean the product doesn’t work, it certainly makes us suspicious. Without more information, we’d hesitate to plunk down a hundred bucks for this stuff. The Brains Bottom Line: We wish there was an easy answer for you, but we can’t find clear evidence that any product will work for sure. A Vitamin K product, like Vita-K , may be worth a try, but don’t spend a ton of money. Are you sick of paying expensive eye cream?

"The Beauty Brains","","7 ways you waste money when buying beauty products by The Beauty Brains Did you know you are probably spending much more money on beauty products than you need to? You are if you are engaging in any of the following seven habits that drain your money without significantly improving your beauty. Buying expensive beauty products While it may be true in some industries that price equals quality, in the cosmetic industry it’s not. The amount that is charged for a beauty product has little to do with the amount of money it takes to produce the product. Price also doesn’t have any correlation with effectiveness. $10 moisturizing creams are just as good (and often better) than $300 moisturizing creams. Salon hair products are no better than grocery store brands. Tip – Price does not equal quality. Avoid the highest priced cosmetics. Buying the same product for more Did you know that sometimes manufacturers will take nearly the same formula and sell it under a different brand name for more money? Sure, they change the product color, fragrance and packaging but they don’t change the ingredients that actually make the product work. For example, Pantene and Herbalessences shampoos are essentially the same formulas. Check the ingredient lists. Tip – Brands can fool your brain. Compare ingredient lists and go with the less expensive product. Buying from multi-level marketers While you might have a friendly relationship with your door to door Arbonne sales person, don’t think that you’re getting some unique technology that will make your skin better than any other product. It won’t. The beauty products sold directly to you are more expensive and definitely not better than products you can buy in the store. Tip – Make your skin care & make-up purchases at a store. Buying beauty products from “experts” While dermatologists know how to treat skin diseases and their advice in this area need not be questioned, they don’t necessarily know the best skin care products to use. Dermatologists often sell their names to a product and don’t actually have much involvement in the development. They also stand to make money if you buy the line that they sell. Why would a dermatologist need to supplement their income by selling beauty products? Don’t they make enough money treating patients? And while stylists know how to style hair, they do not necessarily know about hair products. Be skeptical of any advice they give you about what products to use. They learn about products from the marketing department of salon brands and also make a commission on products you buy from them. When they bash products like Pantene, they do so without any real evidence to back up their claims. Tip – Don’t buy beauty products from doctor’s offices or salons. Falling for Fear Have things you read on the Internet made you afraid of products with sulfates, talc, parabens, propylene glycol, etc.? Well, you are avoiding perfectly good, safe and effective products. There is no scientific evidence that suggests beauty products sold in the United States, Canada, EU or Japan are unsafe. There is also no evidence that the purported “natural” alternatives are safer or better for you or the environment. Tip – Don’t spend extra money on products claimed to be “natural”. Buying Products that Don’t Work Many products out there promise to “solve” your beauty problems. But the truth is there are many problems for which scientists just haven’t figured out solutions. The following are the top beauty product types that are practically ineffective for solving the problem. 1. Cellulite reduction – No cream or lotion will fix this problem 2. Hair growth products – Products mostly don’t work 3. Shave minimizing lotions – They do not slow hair growth 4. Tattoo removal creams – They don’t work. 5. Most miracle wrinkle creams – Some ingredients work but most don’t. 6. Split end repair – Nothing can repair split ends except a hair cut. Tip – Don’t buy products that promise to solve problems that haven’t been solved. Beauty from within Bogus If you are spending money on health food supplements that promise to give you better hair and skin, you’re wasting your money. There is no evidence that a health food supplement is going to have any positive effect on your skin or hair. While it may sound promising and make sense, the scientific support is not there. The other problem is that at least in the US, limited governmental regulation of the food supplement industry allows them to make almost any beauty claim without requiring proof. Tip – Avoid any product that claims to beautify your skin from within. Without specialized knowledge, it’s easy to be taken in by glitzy advertising, friendly sales people, and products that sound too good to be true. If you can remember that price and performance are not related in the beauty product market, you can save yourself lots of money without negatively impacting your appearance. In fact, with the money you save on beauty products, you can go get a nice pair of cute shoes. What are you going to spend your extra money on now that you aren’t wasting it on overpriced beauty products?

"Randy Schueller","","Are LED photofacials good for your skin? by Randy Schueller Here’s a special treat for all you Beauty Brainiacs out there: our special guest-blogger for today is none other than Nicki, from Futurederm.com . If you’re a fan of the Beauty Brains , you’ll love Futurederm . Check it out! And now, on with Nicki’s post… Want Clearer Skin? See the Light. And no, I’m not talking about sunlight, sorry everyone! What I am talking about is the new Tanda Skincare System ($395.00, Amazon.com). The system emits visible wavelength (not UV) light from an LED source (414 nm blue light and 660 nm red light), to treat acne. According to a study by Tanda , the use of their light treatment was “significantly more effective” than treatment with a 5% benzoyl peroxide cream over the same period. Yet, the use of LED has been recently shown to have anti-aging effects for the skin as well. With skin-clearing and firming benefits, is an at-home LED treatment center worth the money? FutureDerm investigates… Acne-clearing benefits According to Kansas City dermatologist Dr. Audrey Kunin’s DERMADoctor site , the Tanda Skincare System is only to be used on patients with mild to moderate acne, not cystic acne. The site says that the way to know the difference is simply by counting the lesions: no more than 125 total lesions across the treatment area (100 whiteheads/blackheads, or 15-50 inflammatory lesions). According to a 107-person 12-week study by Tanda, a 63% mean reduction in inflammatory lesions and a 45% mean reduction in comedones was exhibited by those patients who completed the study. It is speculated that the reason LED is effective against acne is two-fold. One, LED light may have anti-bacterial properties, and there is a small amount of evidence that suggests that light disrupts P. acnes , the primary bacterial species found in acne cases. Two, LED light may have anti-inflammatory properties, which may calm existing lesions and prevent new lesions from forming. Collagen and Elastin Production Stimulation According to a recent study, LED phototherapy repairs sun damage and increases collagen and elastin production, although “lasers and peels have faster, more substantial results, but more side effects,” according to Seung Yoon Lee , a dermatologist at the National Medical Center in South Korea. With regards to LED therapy’s fewer side effects, Lee adds, “LED is safe for dark skin, unlike some lasers.” According to Allure magazine, in the study, the researchers treated one side of 61 subjects’ faces with a light-emitting diode machine, while 15 others received a one-sided placebo treatment. Twelve weeks later, only the LED-targeted skin had a decrease in wrinkles (26-36 percent) and an increase in elasticity (14-19 percent). LED therapy seems to increase collagen and elastin production, although less significantly than dermatologist-administered lasers and peels. Overall Thoughts and Opinions LED therapy has been proven more effective at fighting acne and promoting collagen and elastin production than other at-home procedures. However, greater effects are still available through prescription medications and treatments (lasers, peels) at your dermatologist’s office. At the present time, it is probably a better idea to spend your money on a dermatologist-administered treatment. Hopefully, however, the cost of at-home LED therapy systems like the Tanda Skincare System will decrease. At any rate, the treatment is certainly novel and exciting, and if you want the best in at-home treatments, then this is definitely worth a try!","Are LED photofacials good for your skin?","de02e16a3142646f435c4f09d0a636bf2cb22ac9","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2008/04/are-led-photofacials-good-for-your-skin/"
"The Beauty Brains","","How do teeth whitening mouthwashes work? by The Beauty Brains Emma Wants White: Hi! I love the site & am an avid reader! I am very interested in comparing ingredients between products nowadays thanks to your blog. My question is, is there a difference between using those whitening mouthwashes, and just swishing some hydrogen peroxide around your mouth? Since usually the first or second ingredient is peroxide that I can buy for less than $1.50 for a huge bottle, compared to the $6+ for these whitening mouthwashes, I was just curious. The White Brain , uh, the Right Brain, Responds: Smile Emma! We think the bigger question here is: do these mouthwashes really whiten your teeth? According to the ADA , professional toothwhitening is the way to go. Gee, what a surprise, the American Dental Association is firmly coming down on the side of paying dentists to do all your teeth whitening. But wait, perhaps we’re too cynical too soon. They also say that there are peroxide-based whitening products that you can buy over the counter and use at home! Specifically, there are two ADA approved ways to whiten your teeth: you can bleach the stains (which is what whitening strips do) or you can physically abrade them (which is what toothpaste does). There’s no mention of whitening mouthwashes – why do you think that is? Probably because mouthwashes can’t deliver a high enough concentration of the bleaching agent for a long enough period of time without damaging the tissue in the rest of your mouth. Remember, strips and toothpaste are applied directly to your teeth; mouthwash touches every where in your mouth. There doesn’t seem to by anything wrong with using a “whitening” mouthwash, it just seems unlikely that it will be very effective – at least not as effective as the other methods. And the same goes for gargling with hydrogen peroxide.","How do teeth whitening mouthwashes work?","6a579eb313f94a0a57cc9d35cd3063cc2cde54e9","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2006/10/how-do-teeth-whitening-mouthwashes-work/"
"The Beauty Brains","None","Does Simengdi Bio Gold Pearl cream really work? by The Beauty Brains Jodoll asks… My mother bought me Simengdi Bio-Gold pearl Cream from China, telling me its what everyone uses and its really popular over there. In Canadian dollars, she bought one jar for 30 bucks. That is pretty expensive for creams, especially in China! Do you know if this cream really works? The Left Brain replies: According the information I could track down on this product, Simengdi Bio-Gold is indeed very popular, in fact one source described it as “the most famous skin care brand” in China. Here’s what the website says about Bio-Gold Pearl cream. Bio-Gold: Beauty Science or BS? It effectively lightens and/or removes spots, reduces wrinkles and moisturizes skin. It is rich in BioGold (what ever that is), Pearl amino acids, and Ganoderma which has been described as the King of Herbs and the Gods Herb in the East. Today, scientists have proof that Ganoderma can provide relief for acne, fine lines, age spots and the sun damaged skin. I wouldn’t be surprised if this cream is a decent moisturizer that can moisturize skin and even help reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. But when I read the claim that scientists have “proof” that Ganoderma is good for acne, etc., I became suspicious, so I did some more digging. Ganoderma (from the Latin for “shining skin”) is actually a type of mushroom not an herb. And while it does have some interesting medicinal properties when ingested I could not find any reports on Pubmed indicating it has benefit to the skin what so ever. The closest reference I could find did prove that Ganoderma has antibacterial properties, which at first glance gave me hope that it could be effective against acne. However, according to the study , it is only against gram negative bacteria where as the bacteria that causes acne ( p. acnes ) is gram positive. The Beauty Brains bottom line Does this cream work? Sure, it looks like a good moisturizer. But I can’t find evidence that it provides any benefit that would make it worth more than a regular, much less expensive, skin cream. What do you think? Have you know anyone who’s used this product?

"Perry Romanowski","","Does benzoyl peroxide cause cancer? by Perry Romanowski Hillary’s concerned question: I’m hoping the Beauty Brains can help clear up an issue for me. I use benzoyl peroxide to help treat my acne. Recently I’ve been hearing a lot of buzz about how it might cause cancer and promote premature aging. Some of the sources of this information are suspect as they seem to be pushing products that do not contain benzoyl peroxide, however, a quick search in Pub med did turn up some studies that benzoyl peroxide combined with ultraviolet light caused cancer in Swiss mice. Is this an issue that you can help shed some light on? Thanks! The Left Brain’s acne answer: Hillary, kudos to you for looking up articles on Pub med rather than believing what you read on some company’s website. Benzoyl Peroxide and cancer We looked at the article you found and it does indeed implicate benzoyl peroxide in both papillomas and carcinomas. However, the article is a bit vague. It says benzoyl peroxide was carcinogenic only when used with an initiator, which doesn’t occur with normal use. Secondly, it said benzoyl peroxide produces an effect similar to another compound that causes tumors but there is not directly link to cancer. Finally, I noticed that this study is from 1981 so there’s been plenty of time for follow up research. The latest research F urther literature review turns up several sources that show benzoyl peroxide has been cleared in later studies. To be fair, one reference did say scientists should keep their eye on the subject, just to be safe. In addition, it is also true that in 1995, the FDA changed the status of benzoyl peroxide from Category I (safe) to Category III (more data is needed.) I have not been able to find a current update on the status of benzoyl peroxide. References “Acne and Rosacea: Third Completely Revised and Updated Edition”, 2000: Following application to the skin, benzoyl peroxide is rapidly metabolized to benzoic acid, a harmless chemical. Extensive use in human beings has failed to demonstrate absorption. The drug is eminently safe. The British Journal of Dermatology, 1990: So far no skin malignancies after the clinical use of benzoyl peroxide has been reported. A possible relationship between the use of the compound and the occurrence of malignant melanoma has been looked at in two case-control studies, both with negative results…However, since the average latent period for skin carcinogenesis is of the order of 15-25 years, this requires further follow-up…Thus, the question of carcinogenic potential of benzoyl peroxide is as yet not fully answered, but at the present time it seems likely that this compound is safe to use. Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology, 1995: Topical benzoyl peroxide has been used in the treatment of acne for over 30 years, with no reports of adverse effects that could be related to skin carcinogenesis. Two case-control epidemiological studies have found a lack of association between the specific use of benzoyl peroxide and skin cancer. In addition to these findings in humans, 23 carcinogenicity studies in rodents with benzoyl peroxide, including 16 employing topical application, have yielded negative results. An increase in skin carcinomas was reported in 1 study in which benzoyl peroxide in acetone was applied to the skin of SENCAR mice for a 1-year period; however, this study did not employ adequate control groups to fully understand the unusual findings, and the results were inconsistent with those of 6 other similar studies. The moral of this story is to never believe any single scientific study. Any one study can be flawed, you need to look at body of work of the research to be sure.","Does benzoyl peroxide cause cancer?","1261496839624d382c70f09172d40566f6f269db","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2008/04/does-benzoyl-peroxide-cause-cancer/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Purging your skin does not cause acne by The Beauty Brains Pamela Ponders Purging: Hi! I’ve read the term ‘purging’ from skincare topics. For example, I remember reading that to adjust to a certain new skincare, someone’s skin could breakout, but not because they are have reactions to it, but is getting used to the new product. Do you know if it’s common for people to breakout or have a reaction to a new product but later benefits from it after a certain trial phase? The Right Brain’s Purgatorial Reply: Pamela has accurately captured what some people believe to be true. Even Murad , a maker of acne products, preaches about purging. Murad says: Whenever you begins using a new skin care line, your skin goes through what is called a “Purging Process”. This occurs because the product is actively cleansing and bringing all the trapped oil & impurities to the surface of your skin, which can cause you to break out more. Your skin will also experience some sensitivity and tingling. Is this true? Maybe, kind of, a little bit. The part that is NOT true is that pimples are brought on by “releasing trapped oil.” Acne just doesn’t work that way. For what it’s worth, the Cosmetic Cop essentially agrees with our contention. However, she states that irritation causes pimples to erupt. That’s not entirely accurate either. There is one type of acne, acne mechanica that is caused by mechanical irritation to the skin (like your purse strap rubbing aginst your shoulder). But that generally doesn’t happen with the kind of chemical irritation you can get from cosmetic products. So what part of purging is really true? Well, it’s possible the “breakouts” that people are describing are not really acne at all but folliculitis , a condition that occurs when your follicles are irritated and inflamed. This condition can be caused by irritating cosmetics and it requires different treatment than acne. So, maybe the breakouts from this alleged “purging” are not really tiny pimple volcanoes (ahh, now you see why that picture is there…), but instead are your skin’s initial reaction to a new product. After awhile your skin builds up a bit of an immunity to the irritation and the breakouts subside. But it’s NOT because you’re purging your skin of trapped oils and impurities. At least that’s the best theory the Beauty Brains can come up with. Let us know if this makes sense compared to what you’ve experienced.","Purging your skin does not cause acne","2829f8e137db3b5f9f22c5428e59d936d262777e","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2006/10/purging-your-skin-does-not-cause-acne/"
"The Beauty Brains","2014-02-09 16:15:00","Should I put salt in my hair conditioner? by The Beauty Brains JazzyFresh just wants to know… I’m a member of a hair care forum and recently there has been talk of putting salt in your conditioner for smoother, softer hair. I always thought salt was bad for the hair. Many have said they tried it and have had great results. How exactly is this working? The Left Brain responds: Salt can be drying to hair and skin when left in contact for a long period of time but there’s really no issue with using salt in a rinse off product. In fact, salt is a common thickener used in many shampoos because it is effective (and inexpensive.) It works by screening the ionic charges between surfactant molecules which allows them to pack closer together, resulting in increased viscosity. However, salt is not frequently used in conditioners because it can destabilize the oil and water emulsion system that holds the conditioner together. Having said that, I do have a theory that could account for the effect you’ve described. Salty sensation Even thought it’s not commonly used in this context, salt can also thicken conditioner. A touch of salt gives certain conditioner formulations a richer, creamier texture. This effect is most noticeable when starting with a thin, translucent product. Because this effect is very apparent and instantly observable, it’s easy to attribute this transformation in texture to improved conditioning. If the product feels richer and feels more cushiony as it spreads through the hair it must be better for your hair, right? Wrong. Increased viscosity doesn’t necessarily correlate to improved technical conditioning, although texture provides a powerful sensory cue that can be easily misinterpreted. The Beauty Brains bottom line Salt does not provide any direct conditioning to hair although it can improve the rich creamy texture of conditioners. It’s easy to see how some women might assume that this better texture means the salt gives you better conditioning, but that’s not true. Have YOU ever added salt to a conditioner? Leave a comment and share your salty experience with the rest of the Beauty Brains community.","Should I put salt in my hair conditioner?","f66bbede9f11e83619e1e566f2f68aa19f4dcfd2","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2010/05/should-i-put-salt-in-my-hair-conditioner/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Is Botox bad for your brain? by The Beauty Brains Despite their hype, most wrinkle creams do not have a significant effect on actually reducing wrinkles. The creams are typically just good skin moisturizers with an added “special” ingredient that makes for a good story but doesn’t actually do anything. (The exceptions are ones with effective levels of retinoids ). What really removes wrinkles Of course plastic surgery really removes wrinkles. But it’s expensive and involves one or more surgical procedures. Personally, this Beauty Brain doesn’t like the idea of surgery for fixing the things time is doing to my skin. I’ve seen too many celebrity face lifts that have looked too weird (If you’re interested in seeing celebrities who’ve had cosmetic surgery, check out our favorite blog on the subject .) But if wrinkle creams are bogus and surgery’s not an option, at least there’s Botox. Right? Maybe not! Is Botox Benign? Now, scientists have found evidence that Botox may not be as safe as believed. According to this Italian study, the toxin used in Botox treatments was shown to migrate into the brains of treated rats. They say there were no observable negative effects, but it does seem a little scary. Could you exposing your brain to a known toxin while smoothing out your skin? Of course, scientists and the media who report on these types of things tend to exaggerate to make things sound more sensational. Botox treatments have been around since the early 1980′s and they were approved by the FDA in 2002 . There has been no indication that treatments are turning people into brain damaged zombies. However, science is always changing and when there is evidence of a problem, it is wise to be cautious. More research will be needed so I remain skeptical of the problem. But if you’re thinking about getting Botox this is just one more thing to add to your consideration. Do you really want to risk nerve and brain damage to get rid of wrinkles? Some people might. What do YOU think? Have you, or anyone else you know, had Botox injections? –Mid Brain","Is Botox bad for your brain?","386688e40a3962d79a383144d3fecd9084d70a0a","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2008/04/is-botox-bad-for-your-brain/"
"The Beauty Brains","2014-01-01 12:09:00","The top 3 causes of frizzy hair by The Beauty Brains Bluz Cluz Is Dizzy About Frizzy Hair Hi Beauty Brains. Love the site. My question is what causes frizzy hair and what can I do to prevent this? My hair tends to go crazy in rainy weather or if there’s a lot of humidity in the air. The Right Brain Gives Her A Scientific Spin: BC, here are the 3 main reasons your hair gets frizzy: 1) The Natural Shape of Your Hair: Hair that grows out curly tends to more frizzy than hair that grows out straight. The shape of the shaft is primarily determined by the shape of the follicles, the little tubes under your scalp that your hair grows out of. Sadly, there’s not much you can do to change the genetics of your hair, although you could chemically straighten it. 2) How You Cut and Style It: If you’ve got longer hair that’s experienced a lot of brushing and combing you’ve probably created your hair share of split ends and broken hairs. Once the hair breaks the shorter stub that remains tends to spring outward uncontrollably. That’s because the proteins in hair get “stretched” when the hair is pulled and they don’t go back to their original shape. The result: those frizzy pieces that stick out mid-way down your do. By choosing a shorter cut you can control frizz to some extent. 3) The Environment: Humidity can affect your hair two ways: it can make fine, curly hair fall flat and it can make smooth, straight hair frizz out. Why? Because the inside of your hair, also known as the Cortex, is actually made out of two kinds of protein, the Orthocortex and the Paracortex. These two regions are sandwiched together inside your hair. When it’s humid, moisture penetrates into the hair and is absorbed by these ortho and para regions. The problem is that these areas absorb water differently, so they don’t swell the same. One part may absorb a lot of moisure and swell a lot, while the other stays relatively the same. This differential swelling causes the hair shaft to bend or twist to one side or the other. So, if your hair starts out straight high humidity can make it bend and twist like a snake on a hot sidewalk. (We’ve never actually seen a snake on a hot sidewalk, but we imagine it would get pretty snakey. But we digress…) Because everyone has different amounts of ortho and para in their hair, everyone can have a different reaction to humidity. What can you do about it? Well, you can’t do anything to fight the basic genetic structure of your hair, but thankfully there are styling and treatment products that can fight that battle for you. You can’t competely overcome the effect, but a good conditioner can help block the effects of water on your hair. (Look for something with a good slug of dimethicone in it) and then use high quality styling products that are effective against humidity. By the way, this post’s picture is courtesy of Beth Robinson over at Strangedolls.net. Beth makes the most bizarre custom dolls we’ve ever seen. This one happens to have frizzy hair, hence the tie-in to today’s post. Beth’s dolls are haunting in a delightful way.

"The Beauty Brains","2013-12-22 12:47:00","How long do you have to leave conditioner in your hair? by The Beauty Brains Li longs to learn: Does it matter how long you leave in you conditioner/hair treatment/hair mask? From what I’ve read it only coats the hair anyway so is it better if you leave it on longer? The Right Brain respectfully obliges: You’ve nailed one of the minor myths of hair care, Li. Conditioners DO NOT need to be left on as long as the companies tell you they do. How conditioners work That’s because 90% of the benefit from standard conditioners come from coating the surface of the hair. That’s not a bad thing – in fact, the best thing you can do for hair is to smooth and protect the cuticle (that shingle-like layer that covers your hair.) Yes, you have to take the time to work the product through your hair to make sure it’s evenly distributed (especially if you have a lot of hair.) But once the conditioner has had a chance to spread through your hair, leaving it on longer doesn’t make it do anything better. This part is very important – YOU HAVE TO WORK THE CONDITIONER EVENLY THROUGH YOUR HAIR! That process may take you a few minutes. But once you’ve done that part well, you can rinse. Marketing madness Then why do companies tell you to leave it on? In part, to make their products seem more special (and so they can sell more of them) manufacturers started making different types of conditioners that had to be left on different lengths of time. It goes something like this: Does your hair just need “regular” conditioning? Use this product and rinse it off right away. Does your hair need deep conditioning your hair? Use a different product and leave it on for 10 minutes. Does your hair need a complete restructurizing makeover? Use this other product, leave it on while you shave your legs, get out of the shower, eat breakfast, walk the dog, drive to work, go on vacation… Well, you get the picture. Telling you to leave conditioner on longer is primarily driven by marketing claims and is not based on how well the product works. One possible exception, though, are the oil-type treatments we’ve discussed before. If you’re applying a coconut oil type product to your hair you may need to give it time to penetrate. But other than that, any rinse out conditioner can be rinsed out right away. The Beauty Brains bottom line: In reality, once you’ve got the conditioner worked through your hair it works almost instantly. Letting it “soak in” longer doesn’t improve the way it works. There’s nothing WRONG with leaving treatments in longer, but if you’re in a hurry you can save yourself some time in the shower by not waiting that extra 10 minutes for your conditioner to kick in.","How long do you have to leave conditioner in your hair?","30de6529064b84d6b70fdf0809e1e6e6f0f59efd","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2010/05/how-long-do-you-have-to-leave-conditioner-in-your-hair/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Preparation h for puffy eyes by The Beauty Brains Natalie’s puffy eye problem: I was wondering if you could tell me if it’s ok to use Preparation H for under eye puffiness on a regular basis. There is a variety that comes with hydrocortisone that I’m particularly interested in. Thanks. Forebrain gets to the butt of the problem: First of all, the Beauty Brains would never recommend using ANY medication for any purpose other than it’s intended use, especially around the eyes. Having said that, let’s take a look at causes and solutions for puffiness. Causes of puffy eyes Undereye puffiness is characterized by red swollen skin under the eyes and is usually due to one of these causes: bloating, dehydration, fatigue, allergies, hormones, or genetics. Because the roots of these causes are so varied, it is hard to say which physiological mechanism is behind the puffiness appearance, and therefore not all treatments will work equally well; however, since the redness is due to increased blood flow to the area a treatment aimed at restricting blood vessels should provide some temporary relief. The swelling however, may be for a variety reasons and the treatment for that is not as straightforward. Is Preparation H the answer? Some people believe that Preparation H is useful for treating undereye puffiness since it works by temporarily restricting the blood vessels in the area onto which it is applied. There are many different variations of Preparation H; however, they all basically perform the same function (they just use different ingredients to reduce the irritation). Preparation H with hydrocortisone contains a 1% concentration of the stuff, quite low considering that you can get hydrocortisone creams with concentrations up to 2.5% over-the-counter. In general, although it may in theory seem effective, I would not recommend anyone to use any kind Preparation H on their undereye area for one big reason. If you accidentally get some in your eye, the other ingredients can seriously damage the eye, and then unfortunately undereye puffiness will be the least of your concerns. Besides that, I wasn’t able to find any conclusive scientific evidence on Preparation H being more effective than other methods of reducing undereye puffiness, basically meaning that this treatment is more of an urban legend than actual fact. The Straight Dope came to the same conclusion in their entertaining article on this topic. What about hydrocortisone? So what about using just hydrocortisone? As I have previously mentioned, you can get hydrocortisone creams without a prescription at a pharmacy at concentrations up to 2.5%. As a topical steroid, it has anti-inflammatory effects and could in theory temporarily reduce puffiness in the undereye region. However, as with Preparation H, there is a concern regarding accidentally getting the stuff in your eyes, in fact the manufacture state that you should NOT use the product in, or near, your eyes. Also, prolonged use of topical steroids like hydrocortisone has been shown to cause skin thinning, increase skin fragility, enlarged blood vessels, and prolonged use in large doses can result in problems with your adrenal gland (the natural steroid producer in the body). So what’s a girl (or boy) to do? So what should you do to treat undereye puffiness? While there are temporary treatments like applying cool water compresses to the area, sleeping with your head slightly elevated (you can use an extra pillow), the best way to get rid of undereye puffiness is to address the underlying roots of the problem. Are you getting enough rest? Seven hours of sleep per night is the recommended minimum. Also, often undereye puffiness is due to allergies. While it may not be pollen season, you can still be allergic to anything from airborn allergens like grass to certain foods that are a part of your diet. Get an allergy test done, or try eliminating foods from your diet to see if any relief occurs. Another big reason for undereye puffiness is bloating or dehydration. This can be hormonal like before menstruation, or because of diet. The best treatment in these cases is to take a diuretic (it will help you eliminate the extra fluids), as well as to drink enough water and consume healthy amounts of salt to stay hydrated but not bloated. Finally, for some people, having puffy eyes is hereditary. In these cases, there really is not much you can do besides really invasive measures like cosmetic eyelid surgery, something I don’t personally advocate. The Beauty Brains bottom line As undereye puffiness can be a sign of a health issue like lack of sleep, allergies, or hydration problems in these cases, it is important to address the root issue and not just the symptoms. However, in cases where immediate relief is necessary my recommendation is to avoid Preparation H and hydrocortisone, and rather use a cooling compress, head elevation, and rest. (For info on puffy eyes check out this post .) Please remember to read cautions and warnings on packaging of products you are not sure about since they will usually give you a pretty good idea of where the stuff isn’t meant to go. And finally, if you’ve tried everything and the puffiness is still not going away, it might just be hereditary in which case there really isn’t much you can do besides a few make up tricks. Fun Fact: A rumour exists in the US that Preparation H is the most shoplifted supermarket product since customers are too embarrassed to bring it to the cash register.

"Perry Romanowski","None","Can the world’s deadliest poison make your eye lashes grow longer? by Perry Romanowski Several readers have asked about promoting eyelash growth. The notion of using castor oil as a growth accelerant keeps coming up… Marta Says: I have heard that castor oil does promote eyelash growth. I was talking to an old Indian lady who is an aesthetician and she said that in the old country this is what women used for eyelash growth. The Left Brain Comments: At the risk of upsetting Marta and aetheticians everywhere, I feel compelled to point out that while aestheticians are trained in skin care techniques, they are generally not chemists. This half of The Beauty Brains would prefer to see the scientific research on castor oil rather than take someone`s word for it. So what does the scientific community say? Well, the American Cancer Society looked into a bunch of false claims about castor oil and decided that there was no data to show that it did much of anything. I quote the ACS : Naturopathic practitioners and some others claim that castor oil boosts the immune system by increasing white blood cells, which help the body fight infection,and other immune cells. They also claim that castor oil helps dissolve cysts, warts, and tumors, as well as soften bunions and corns. Other claims for castor oil include treating lymphoma, bacterial and viral diseases (including HIV), arthritis, skin and hair conditions, eye irritations, diseases of the colon and gallbladder, bursitis, multiple sclerosis, and Parkinson’s disease. There is no scientific evidence to support these claims… So, until someone can do a controlled study that shows castor oil makes your eyelashes grow, color me skeptical. By the way, did you know that castor oil comes from the castor bean, the same bean that ricin, one of the world`s most deadly poisons is derived from? Only 1/5000 of a gram of ricin can kill you if you inhale, ingest, or inject it. It’s twice as deadly as cobra venom! Does that mean castor oil is dangerous? Is it it really some kind of murderous mascara? Not at all, I just thought this was an interesting science fact that would catch your attention. (he he, I warned the Right Brain that I was feeling mischievious today!) Ok, but what about other eyelash growth products that readers have asked about like Jan Marini Age Intervention and Mavala Switzerland’s Double Lash? Stay tuned for a future post on these soon! Sandy February 8, 2007 at 11:38 pm Actually, I’ve used pure castor oil from my pharmacy on my lashes and they became thicker and longer after about a month. jen March 16, 2007 at 1:22 pm I have been using castrol oil for about a month, and Havn’t seen any changes. My eyelashes are the same. This is just a myth, and i wouldn’t be recomending anyone to use it, since i have had several eye infections since using castrol oil. Left Brain March 16, 2007 at 2:12 pm Thanks for the comments Jen. Castor oil could harbor bacteria so it would make sense that you could get an eye infection. You could put a preservative in there to prevent it. dsd May 1, 2007 at 3:34 am Castor oil really does work.. my eyelashes are great because of this.. so shut up.. you dont know everything!!! thebeautybrains May 1, 2007 at 6:34 am True we don’t know everything. But we know enough to be skeptical of claims about castor oil. I’d love to believe it but there just isn’t any proof. Just because you use a material and you think you see a benefit (whether you really do or not) doesn’t mean the stuff you put on was responsible for the effect. If you treat your lashes with castor oil, 3 things can happen. 1. They get longer 2. They get shorter 3. They stay the same. The exact same things could happen if you treat your eyelashes with nothing. Now, how do you prove the castor oil did anything. Anecdotal stories about a material working for someone is not proof. tac May 5, 2007 at 7:11 am On this website: http://www.agingeye.net/otheragingeye/blepharitis.php which says its is from the university of chicago dry eye institue it says that castor oil has anti-inflammatory effects on the eye if used regularly (it even cites a journal article) and it says that 2 popular dry eye ointments contain castor oil. While this is not scientific evidence that it helps with eyelas growth it does look like ther is evidence of other eye nenefits thebeautybrains May 5, 2007 at 2:08 pm Thanks for the reference, Tac. You’re right, this doesn’t prove anything about eyelash growth but it’s interesting none the less. rob June 17, 2007 at 4:54 pm Does It Make Ur Hair Grow On ur Head? thebeautybrains June 18, 2007 at 7:02 am No. earth July 24, 2007 at 1:13 pm Refresh lubrication eye drops as well as Restasis for severe dry eye have Castor Oil in both. The most important thing is to understand how the oil or medication is formulated. L August 9, 2007 at 7:00 pm A hypothesis: Is it possible that the appearance longer lashes is just due to the castor oil killing off demodex folliculorum (which make lashes fall out easier)? It would explain why castor oil is effective in treating eye irritation and hit or miss as far as seeing lash results (you’re either have the mites or not). And probably a good alternative to those in less developed countries (like India) where such ointments aren’t readily available. Sara August 10, 2007 at 8:27 am I’ve had literarily amazing effects with CAstor oil. Just apply it like you would mascara (lightly) and then go to sleep .. do this for a week and you should see excellent results. My lower lashes are SO long.. as well as my outer ones which means i no longer wear mascara. My boyfriend started telling me just how amazing my eyes/eyelashes were when i woke up first thing int he morning. This stuff seriously does work. Obviously it will vary from person to person.. as in how much your eyelashes are already growing ot their full potential and what the full growth potential of your eyelashes is! It works. NO DOUBT WHATSOEVER aysha October 1, 2007 at 7:02 am i really tried it b4 ad it worked and later on it stopped workin..isnt this a bit weird??lol aysha October 1, 2007 at 7:04 am and btw is there any eye drops or sumthin which will help in growth of eyelashes (as in thicker,longer,and darker lashes?!) please replllyy!!! thnx heapz lizzie October 1, 2007 at 7:06 am i have the same question as wat aysha asked…….please email me or write it in here if therez any way in getting longer,thicker and darker lashes……anything for the eyebrow to get thicker and darker aswell?? PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE reply….thnx alooot Janie October 5, 2007 at 12:32 pm I share a healthy skepticism of a natural healing claims but am also open to trying some. I can tell you, for a fact, castor oil works on removing warts and skin lesions. I had a wart like skin lesion; I put castor oil on it, covered it with a bandaid, and after 10 days it peeled off smoothly. It left a red spot, but that faded within a week or so. It ou can’t even tell anything was there now. This skin lesion was the same type that was on my back that I had frozen off a year or so earlier. I don’t know about the hair growth, but it actually worked for me on the skin lesion, and we also use it for sore muscles, and it works for that also. Janie ram December 8, 2007 at 5:04 pm Hi, Will castor oil help grow hair back on my bald head?? Appreciate an answer ~ram Kishia May 7, 2008 at 3:57 pm It depresses me to see your site be so negative, it seems like no product works out there and that we are so dependent on chemicals drugs and studies , which a lot of times are purposely rigged to have the drug companies make the most money. How in the word have we survived for so long without those drugs before???? Kishia May 7, 2008 at 3:59 pm No Castor oil will not help hair growth. nasty May 11, 2008 at 4:09 pm i don’t really understand “deadly poison” …most of the people in haiti use it(and have been using it for many years) for about everything and they ingest it too and i’ve never seen anybody have any kind of reaction with it and the haitian one is unrefined…so…i dont know about that poison thing and it does make hair and lashes thicker heidi July 31, 2008 at 2:12 pm well Castor Oil is a stimulant laxative, its not a “deadly poison”. if it werea “deadly poison” people wouldnt be selling it, but im going to try it on my eyelashes see how it works for me T. Mendes August 5, 2008 at 7:47 pm Ummm…. Castor Oil grew the hair on my head out. But see, I am black and my hair is naturally curly and dry. It works wonders as a hair shine serum since you only need one drop for the whole head. My hair was cut in a bob due to a bad salon experience and I used this on my ends for protection. My hair is now past my bra after 2 1/2 years. No, it doesn’t make it grow ‘faster’ but it coats the hair shaft to make the hair stronger so that it doesn’t break and it helps lubricate the scalp to give the hair a healthy environment to grow. It doesn’t force hair to grow. It does work on my eyebrows though That and I don’t think this will work on Caucasian hair. My hair can be oiled daily after washing. For castor oil to work, you must use it often. I think this will make caucasian hair oily and limp. So if your hair already grows fast, you dont need this. If your hair is dry and breaking, rub some oil on your ends at night and wash out. This will help retain your length and grow out longer. ann August 21, 2008 at 5:38 pm My dog had a wart in his mouth. The vet said it is very common for puppies in daycare because of mouth to mouth contact with other dogs. For 3 weeks there was no change until I read on a homeopathic website about castor oil. I put it on a q-tip and put it on the wart for 2 nights….IT IS TOTALLY GONE. I’m still amazed! Kelly August 27, 2008 at 12:14 pm I have used Castor Oil on my eyelashes (which are pretty nice to begin with) for the past month. They are incredibly long and full now. My bottom lashes are longer & fuller than they have ever been. I have had no irritation. What I’ve seen so far is very impressive. Nesslee September 22, 2008 at 7:25 am Hello, I suppose the treatment of the castor oil is very important since the poison is located in the seeds. I wonder if the castor oil bought from a pharmacy is subject to any risk like that? F October 5, 2008 at 12:10 am I would like to buy ORGANIC Tea Tree 100% Pure Australian Oil (100ml+), culled from the leaves of a tree (Melaleuca alternifolia), Pharmaceutical Grade of less than 5% cineole and over 35% terpinen-4-ol which qualifies for “Pharmaceutical Grade”, as established by the Australian Tea Tree Oil Industry Association and ORGANIC TTO PRODUCTS to Contain the Natural Benefits of Tea Tree Oil (can contain other organic ingredients like Aloe Vera, etc.) but having difficulty to find it free from SLS/SLES, Parabens, phthalates and artificial fragrances etc. or it does not state: PHARMACEUTICAL GRADE and its percentage- I need at least 50% TTO in all products: facial non- soap cleanser, shower gel, shampoo, lotion, cream, deodorant, toothpaste (e.g. 50% tea tree oil with Macadamia nut oil, applied with cotton tip applicators, after one drop of tetracaine, then 20% and 10% tea tree oil ointment for dry inflamed eyelids on Demodex Folliculorum/ Brevis. TTO Products on face- mild pustular ROSACEA). Anyone there could help (UK London based, it is needed by this Sunday 12/10/2008), please? Many thanks for any suggestions kitty November 15, 2008 at 1:21 pm well i ordered some castor oil and almond oil from the pharmacy at the grocery store that i work at. i will be picking it up today and trying one or the other today. i will keep u posted. i am nervous. but i think i will try the almond oil first since it is also good for ur skin. but isnt ironic? castor beans and bitter almonds are poisonous when prepared a certain way. Tee November 28, 2008 at 8:22 pm castor oil helped me eyelashes grow, and it is good to be used on cetain types of hair specifically dry or brittle hair it helps it stay strong similar to using olive oil on the hair mary January 2, 2009 at 5:43 pm I just purchased cold pressed castor oil from the health food store. and I am going to try it on a friend of mine who is bald. we shall see. I will write back after a month. Rebekah May 15, 2009 at 9:09 am I think its great to consult natural remedies to naturally occurring problems. It has been long known that even our rights to seek such “naturally” occurring remedies hs been down played by ever growing companies that simply use them themselves to compose a solution. Even the governmental policies have scewed to target stamping out our rights to even seek natural remedies. I urge you to be aware of these falicies and exercise your rights to do just what you are doing, freely access natural remedies. dianna May 18, 2009 at 9:48 am i started using castor oil on my face nightly and eyelashes nightly. a few weeks later i noticed that i had new hair growing at my temples. also my eyelashes are definitely longer because my boyfriend asked me when i started wearing eye make-up and i wasn’t! he said my eyelashes looked longer than usual! try it – what do you have to lose? if it works for you great – if not save it for constipation. malika August 22, 2009 at 8:26 am um. i don’t mean to be rude but indian, arab and even some african women (including all the women in my family) have been using castor oil for centuries. I myself have been using it with good results. the castor BEAN oil is poisonous but only if you are a chemist who knows how to utilize it. otherwise the regular comestic grade and laxative castor oil is completely harmless. if anything its more more safe than talika and other ‘lash growth miracles’. Sandra October 5, 2009 at 12:00 am Of course the ACS will say this. They hate naturapathic practitioners because they actually have CURED people. I’m proof of that. I DO NOT trust the ACS or the FDA or western medicine. Castor oil DOES NOT contain ricin. It is extracted and left on the shell of the seeds so therefore the oil does not have ricin. I just bought some cold-pressed castor oil from Whole Foods. I plan on using it on my sparse lashes as well as on my dog who has a tumor on his side. I spent 4000 dollars to have it removed but it came back. I will not put him through the pain of surgery again. It is worth a try. This works 4 me! October 11, 2009 at 9:56 pm I have done this and it works. If there is no proof that it works why are they using it as an ingrident in eyelash growing cosmetics under it’s ingredient name (not listed as castor oil)? Why waste your time adding it? You can put water and chicken fat in a tube and sell it as an eyelash product. There is proof they just aren’t saying so. And I have proof because I do this and it works. thebeautybrains October 13, 2009 at 7:10 am They put it in there because people believe that it does something. People who believe things without proper proof are a cosmetic marketer’s dream customer. paul November 19, 2009 at 2:30 pm how do you apply the castor oil on your upper and lower lids? what happens if it gets in your eyes? should you rinse? thankss Adrian February 28, 2010 at 6:10 am These comments have solved a question that has bothered me for a long time. Many sources of information on castor oil such as Wiki mention that it is used to help eyelashes grow. But none of the sources including ones in German mention one word about applying it externally on the lashes themselves or by taking it internally. A good way to test it would be to apply it on just one eye. About using it on hair I found no effects on the hair but it certainly keeps dandruf under control. The only disadvantage I found is that the pillow cases soon get dark. Ea Ea March 21, 2010 at 6:44 pm Thanks for the good list of things for which castor oil may be useful. Obviously, it DOES work for some of them (even spectacularly at times). Sofia June 13, 2010 at 12:18 pm Bah.. science wants to debunk all the fun theories. Go ahead and trust this article, girls.. but daily castol oil applications to my lashes has done wonders. Christina August 15, 2010 at 8:36 pm I dont understand why evryone is being so negative about the castor oil applied on eye lashes since they didn’t even tried it!! I’ll tell you guys actually i use it and it really does works i swear! i use it, my mom, my sisters all of us have long, thick, and strong eye lashes it really does work i’ve been using this about a year and it really does work don’t worry you won’t get any eye infection or whatever since you apply it lightly and smoothly on your eye lashes by the mascara. Just mix Castor oil with Vitamin E pure oil (Vitamin E very good option For eye lashes volume, its great) and put them in the mascara (let it be completly clean) and apply it evry night before you sleep believe me from the first week u’ll notice GREAT results. xx Lia August 25, 2010 at 8:12 pm Hmmmmmm… Castor oil a ‘murderous mascara’? Highly doubtful. Especially considering the carcinogenic ingredients in conventional mascara. Kristine September 6, 2010 at 2:16 pm @ TheBeautyBrains There have been close to 1,800 recalls on drugs in the U.S. last year alone; castor oil has been used to thicken lashes in many different communities for ages. Now I could tell you from personal experience that castor oil has made my lashes/brows significantly thicker and longer but I doubt my opinion would hold any merit. If you want answers look it up! Scientific research does exist supporting this theory, it’s just harder to find. *Sidebar* I think it’s interesting how you got the scientific community’s opinion with citations from the American Cancer Society considering that Americans have the 9th most deaths from cancer in the world. But I digress. rodina September 28, 2010 at 2:34 pm Is vaseline could also make our eyelash grow longer and thicker. Because I don’t know where I should buy castor oil here in philippines, could somebody tell me if they know.. Thank you… Angie October 6, 2010 at 2:04 am Castor Oil (cold pressed) from a health food store (I buy the brand “Home Health” it costs $6.00 for a 8 oz. bottle) has removed wrinkles off my face, gown eyelashes and brows longer and thicker and removed sun spots off my arms. I am 60 years old and guys 1/2 my age hit on me all the time. I just simply wash my face, dry it, pat Castor Oil on my face, lashes and brows (also pat on my ears) and under my jaw line every night before I go to bed. Tip: Apply the Castor Oil then wait 5 minutes then lightly pat warm water where ever you applied the oil and the oil will drink up the water and fill your pores with moisture. Your skin will have a natural fresh youthful glow in the morning, not oily. I’ve been doing this for 3 years and my face is tight and wrinkle free! Try it girls, you’ll love the fresh feel and look. ADA November 4, 2010 at 10:37 pm Hello, This comment is directed not just to this article, but articles generally posted on this website. I am assuming that they are being posted by the same person. I think you have a very limited understanding of scientific research and it’s application to answering everyday problems or questions. The fact that research has not confirmed a notion to be true does not make it false. It simply means that it has not been proven. I wonder if you have a scientific background. You make it appear so, but i disagree with the stand you take on many of the articles I have read on this site. I am a medical researcher but I do not think that only claims that have been verified through research are worth trying. Please try to revise your approach to answering questions posed to you. I think many people regard you as a reliable source. ADA November 4, 2010 at 10:52 pm I also wanted to add. With regards to the toxic protein you mentioned in the post, RICIN is not found in castor oil, but remains in the seed mash after extraction. Thus, the oil is safe to apply to the skin and even to consume(it does however have a strong laxative effect). I can also tell you that where I come from, the whole castor seeds are eaten(after fermentation). It is called “ogiri” and used as a condiment in food. Probably, this eliminates the toxicity of ricin; the same way cassava which contains cyanide is fermented and actually used as a staple food. I know this is a bit off-point, just thought I should mention. Maya November 7, 2010 at 12:33 pm Castor Oil really works for eyelashes, hair and eyebrows. Whoever says it doesn’t probably hasn’t tried it, hasn’t been persistent enough with it or is involved in selling other, more expensive remedies. Method: Try to buy as good custor oil as you can, perhaps pharmaceutical grade or organic. Get a little dropper bottle for ease of application. I just put the tiniest amount (half a drop, maybe less) on my index finger, smear it quickly between my index finger and my thumb and stroke my eyelashes with my index finger in an upward motion, such depositing castor oil on them. If you have and old, clean mascara wand and tube, you can use that, otherwise, the clean finger method works perfectly. Do this every night after washing your faces and before going to bed. My eyelashes are stronger, longer and thicker and they never fall off any more, even when I rub my eyes. This used to be my pet peeve, not any more. When I ocassionally wear reading glasses, my eyelashes now touch the lenses of the glasses, lol, that’s how long they became. The results (thicker, longer, stronger lashes + new growth) will usually happen within 2-3 weeks of REGULAR application. I sometimes apply castor oil during the day, but, for obvious reasons, I don’t wear mascara after oil application. For hair, you must mix castor oil with the runnier oil, jojoba is good, otherwise castor oil is too thick to work with. Add a few drops of rosemary oil (experiment with quantities, start with a few drops and increase if needed). Massage this into your scalp a night before washing your hair the next day, making sure that the scalp absorbs it nicely. I guarantee that your hair will start growing thicker, longer and be healthier (this is for women only). In addition, rosemary oil will eliminate any itching, flaking and dandruff you may have and it also helps regulate the oil production – pepermint oil is good for this, too. I actually mix in a few drops of both, my scalp loves it. My hair is thicker, healthier, and I have baby hair growing in the areas where I had no hair previously, such as around my very high hairline. Hair takes a bit longer to grow than eyelashes/eyebrows, perhaps after a couple of months. However, the massage is highly relaxing and benefitial and only once/twice a week is enought to stimulate new hair growth. Perhaps if someone is to do it more often, it would happen even quicker. Do try it, it is cheap, effective and natural. And, no, I am not an oil purveyor, I just want to share my experience as I spent hundreds of pounds on some artificial, unnatural junk that doesn’t work, while these beautiful oils were available for pennies. Now I don’t use anything else and will never be without wonderful oils. P.S. Another tip While washing your hair, mix a couple of drops of rosemary oil with your shampoo and massage into the scalp. This will also stimulate the scalp and eliminate any itching and flaking you might have. But just a couple of drops, please, as it is a very potent oil and may irritate the scalp if used in large quantities. concerned November 25, 2010 at 10:44 am OMG !!

Pam December 21, 2010 at 9:38 am LMFAOOOOOO at “concerned” comment!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! jackie December 22, 2010 at 3:28 am I’ve been using castor oil on my eyelashes every evening for a month and a half now, and it DOES work! My lashes are thicker, longer, stronger, you name it. Also, the tiny wrinkles under my eyes – gone… But it’s very important to be persistent. Since I like my little evening rituals, I don’t think I’ll be forgeting to put castor oli on.","Can the world’s deadliest poison make your eye lashes grow longer?","1d8e1a008cb01692c1f58870c21d853552d72c33","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2006/10/117/"
"The Beauty Brains","2014-12-31 09:09:00","Are Bliss Spa Products Worth It? by The Beauty Brains Cindy says… I’ve been eying Bliss Spa products and was wondering if you ladies have an opinion on them? They are so expensive! Are they worth the debt? The Right Brain can barely stop laughing: Ok, as a rule we strive to maintain scientific objectivity. But when we checked out the Bliss Spa website we laughed so hard we almost spit Diet Coke all over our monitor. Bliss B.S. We don’t know about all the products in the Bliss Line, but the one that caught our attention was their Ray Of Hope Slenderizing Sunscreen. What was so funny? We quote from their website : We’ve preloaded our newest sunscreen with slender spheres™—microscopic molecules that unleash the visually slimming effect of caffeine (and carnitine and centella asiatica) when exposed to the sun. It’s a two-in-one. A tan and tone. A sun and slim. It’s so radical, it almost requalifies tanning as constructive. How’s that for seductive? Seductive? How’s that for a totally unsupportable claim??? No other reputable company is making this kind of claim. Don’t you think the massive research staffs at P&G and L’Oreal would be all over this kind of product if it really worked? Doesn’t it seem just a tad bit suspicious that this relatively obscure salon brand has technology that no one else in the Free World possesses? From our vantage point there are two possibilities. 1) Bliss has discovered alien technology that allows them to do things the rest of the beauty industry can’t do. 2) They’re making this up. Not to be judgmental, but our money is on #2. We haven’t seen any peer reviewed scientific studies that reproducibly show that caffeine products have a visible slimming effect. And on top of that, we’ve never heard of solar-activated slimming. Whew! These guys are bold, we’ll give them that much. Unfortunately, we don’t think they’ve got the technology to back up their brashness. The Beauty Brains bottom line At a glance, Bliss Spa scares us because the first product we checked out makes claims that appear to be unsupportable. We don’t want to draw conclusions about the entire line based on looking at just one product, but what we’ve seen doesn’t stack up scientifically. But hey, we’re glad to make friends. If the good people at Bliss send us their claim support data we’d be glad to reconsider our comments.

"The Beauty Brains","","How to banish chlorine from your bathing suit by The Beauty Brains BW is bikini bound: I am getting ready for a much needed vacation and pulled my swim suit out of its drawer that it had been in since summer 07. It smelled of chlorine. I was wondering is there any product out there that can rid my suit of the chlorine smell? Sarah Bellum says: I hear you girlfriend! After my cruise to Barbados my suit was chlorine-stinky for months! But don’t worry ‘cause chemistry comes to the rescue! Here are five ways you can clear out the chlorine. It’s the Beauty Brains ‘ 5 Tips for Removing Chlorine 1. Ultraswim shampoo This tip is good for your hair style as well as your swim suit. Ultraswim shampoo contains an ingredient called sodium thiosulfate that neutralizes chlorine. Try using it to wash your suit AND your hair. 2. Pet power According to Good Housekeeping, you can use chlorine remover which is available at pet stores. Add a drop to a gallon of cool water and swish your suit. 3. Vinegar soak eHow says to soak your suit in a sink of very cool water with 2 tablespoons of vinegar because it’s a good general neutralizer. 4. Chlor-out Buy a bottle of Chlor-Out and give it a try. Although it’s designed for aquariums, many swimmers swear by this stuff. 5. Splurge on Suit Saver Buy some Suit Saver , it contains an antioxidant that binds the chlorine so it doesn’t smell (and so it’s no longer able to break bonds of the elastic and deteriorate fabrics and colors.) If all five of these fail you, maybe you should invest in a swimsuit that is made to be chlorine resistant. Don’t you really just want an excuse to buy a new suit anyway?

"Perry Romanowski","None","Does petroleum jelly cause cancer by Perry Romanowski Katie’s conundrum… Hey Beauty Brains! Love your site, I’ve found it recently but I’m addicted. I have a question about the-one-and-only Vaseline. I use it for everything: lips, removing eye makeup, and as an lash conditioner. But I’ve been hearing that petroleum jelly is really bad for you, even claiming to cause breast cancer after long term use! What’s your say?I knew I could count on you! Thanks! The Beauty Brains respond: What a great question and one that many of your fellow Beauty Brainiacs wonder about too. The quick answer is this nonsense! There is no evidence that petroleum jelly causes breast cancer, skin cancer, or any other type of cancer. The people that are telling you it does are either misinformed, misguided or liars. So, here’s the bottom line on Vaseline, aka petroleum jelly, aka petrolatum. It was first discovered in the late 1850’s and was later patented and sold to the general public in 1872. These facts are just included to show that it’s been around and used for a long time. This doesn’t prove that it’s perfectly safe, but it certainly is compelling evidence. What is it? It is a by-product from the production of oil. In technical terms, it is a complex combination of hydrocarbons obtained as a semi-solid from dewaxing paraffinic residual oil. It consists predominantly of saturated crystalline and liquid hydrocarbons having carbon numbers predominately greater than C25. What is it used for? In the beauty business, it is one of the best performing occlusive moisturizing ingredients you can use on your skin. No material has been shown to be better at improving skin moisture levels. The problem with this material is that it feels greasy, so cosmetic chemists spend a lot of time and effort trying to make less greasy feeling lotions that moisturize. Is it safe? After combing through the published medical evidence over at PubMed we could find no studies that linked petroleum jelly to any cancers whatsoever. If someone is claiming such a link, it is not being done by a reputable scientific research organization. If you are curious, read this safety data that manufacturers of petroleum jelly must provide to users. In Europe (EU) the only restriction on the use of this material is that you have to have a certification from the producer of petroleum jelly that it is free of carcinogens. This is required because SOME methods of production can result in petroleum jelly mixtures that have known cancer causing ingredients in them. The Beauty Brains bottom line Petroleum jelly will not cause cancer. It is perfectly safe and is an excellent ingredient for skin and hair care products. If someone`s telling you different ask them what they are trying to sell. No doubt, some natural alternative. Nonsense. And if you’re curious, here are a host of other fun applications for petroleum jelly . { 101 comments… read them below or add one } Next Comments → Natalie March 8, 2007 at 1:16 am Beauty Brains(you have such big brains) (not) I am appalled at you!!!!!!!Frauds!!!!!!!!!I did some reaearch and found out that petroleum jelly can cause cancer!!!!!!! Nobody listen to what they say, they just want to make money off of the things they sell!!!!!! They don’t care if it causes heart disease, cancer, diabetes!!!!!!! All they care about is making money!!!!!!How could you!!!!!!!?????? Do you know how many people have died of cancer!? You’re horribe!!!!!!!! From, An 11 year old (who did her research), Natalie thebeautybrains March 9, 2007 at 7:54 am Natalie, It’s so nice of you to leave a comment. We genuinely appreciate everyone who takes the time to say what’s on their mind. So sorry that we’ve disappointed you. Although your words are a bit harsh, you do make some interesting points. Congratulations on doing extra research. You should never trust one source for your information. Always get independent confirmation of the facts from legitimate sources. And that is really the problem with what you’ve said. What kind of research did you do? Who were your sources? There are thousands of people and companies out there who want to scare you. They put up bogus reports linking petroleum jelly or other ingredients (like sulfates or propylene glycol) to cancer just to scare everyone. There is absolutely NO PROOF that the petroleum jelly used in cosmetic products causes cancer. In fact, the American Medical Association lists petroleum jelly as a drug for treating severely dry skin. The research you have done has not included all sources such as the United States FDA, the AMA, the Cosmetics & Toiletries Association, etc. The things you have read are most likely written by small natural/organic companies who want to trick you into buying their products. Please don’t fall for their ploys. Or at the very least, do a little more research and keep an open mind. You just can’t believe everything you read. If you have a specific piece of research that shows the refined Petroleum Jelly used in cosmetics causes cancer we would love to see it. Our minds can be changed by good research. We’ve just never seen any that shows petroleum jelly causes cancer. And as far as us trying to sell something, The Beauty Brains DO NOT SELL any products. We care about cancer, heart disease, & diabetes. We also care about the truth & stopping unscrupulous companies from lying to consumers about the things in their cosmetic products. Thanks again for writing. It’s great to hear from an 11 year old with passion and smarts enough to do some research on her own. Left Brain Midbrain March 16, 2007 at 10:10 pm I want to know what 11 year old Natalie is doing on the internet at 1:16 a.m. in the morning. Shame on (little??) Natalie’s Mother and Father for not keeping tabs on her internet time. Carina March 21, 2007 at 9:10 pm Vaseline, BAD. natile is in my class and i did research too!!!!! Left Brain March 21, 2007 at 10:41 pm Carina, thanks for the comments. We’d be interested to see what kind of research you are talking about. Please see the comments above. R April 11, 2007 at 10:30 pm Hello, I am R (This is a public website, I do no want to recite my full name)I, went to UCLA University, and we did experiments and did find odd bacteria, which led to causing various cancers, please, tell me the the experiments YOU did to find that it does NOT cause cancer at all. Thanks, R thebeautybrains April 24, 2007 at 5:56 am R, Since you claim to be a scientist YOU should know that no one can prove a negative. You can’t prove petrolatum doesn’t cause cancer just like you can’t prove water doesn’t cause cancer. Since there is no proof that it does cause cancer, I’m confident in saying that it doesn’t cause cancer. jenny May 21, 2007 at 9:24 am In response to R’s comment, if you were indeed a scientist at a respected university such as UCLA, or at the very least, a mediocre high school student, you would know that the bacteria of which you speak is a contamination of the petroleum jelly and not actually an ingredient in the petroleum jelly. Jeez, get a life. If you want to go ona crusade, at least be “edumacated”! Chris June 29, 2007 at 5:25 pm The state of California would argue with your assessment of petrolatum. Any product sold that contains same is required to have the following disclaimer: Warning: This product contains a chemical known to the State of California to cause cancer. Obviously the Stae of California disagrees with your findings. Good luck, Chris Jackson Crystal N. W. October 2, 2007 at 4:06 am The FDA and even the AMA have very poor track records when it comes to stuff like this. Most government organizations are run by corporations now. The in-house folks, the regular workers doing the research and work, do not have any influence at the top. The top is usually run by boards with people from various powerful companies. It really is best to look at actual research and studies if one has a medical question. Also, one must read the research VERY carefully. Things are not always as they seem. In any event, I do not believe PJ causes cancer directly. HOWEVER, there are contaminents in PJ that DO cause cancer. In some products, such as hair relaxers, roughly 98% are contaminated. You can research this at your leisure. We knew about this forever but I think just recently the WHO and parts of Europe put a limit on 1,4-dioxane. The good ol’ corrupt US has no such limit. Approximately 35% of lipsticks are contaminated. Also, this is just referring to one chemical. There are others. I dont think PJ is horrible though. There are many other worse things out there that ignorant people dont know of. It’s not there fault though. They have been mislead by money-hungry, powerful people and institutions. I will use PJ but I will not use it on my lips regularly. thebeautybrains October 2, 2007 at 8:55 pm Crystal: Thanks for your comments. And just so you know, the US FDA has looked into 1,4 dioxane. Here’s out post on the subject: http://thebeautybrains.com/2007/07/09/is-sunblock-giving-my-baby-cancer/ Dan Lewis November 26, 2007 at 11:36 am What are total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH)? Total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) is a term used to describe a large family of several hundred chemical compounds that originally come from crude oil. Crude oil is used to make petroleum products, which can contaminate the environment. Because there are so many different chemicals in crude oil and in other petroleum products, it is not practical to measure each one separately. However, it is useful to measure the total amount of TPH at a site. TPH is a mixture of chemicals, but they are all made mainly from hydrogen and carbon, called hydrocarbons. Scientists divide TPH into groups of petroleum hydrocarbons that act alike in soil or water. These groups are called petroleum hydrocarbon fractions. Each fraction contains many individual chemicals. Some chemicals that may be found in TPH are hexane, jet fuels, mineral oils, benzene, toluene, xylenes, naphthalene, and fluorene, as well as other petroleum products and gasoline components. However, it is likely that samples of TPH will contain only some, or a mixture, of these chemicals. back to top ——————————————————————————– What happens to total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) when they enter the environment? TPH may enter the environment through accidents, from industrial releases, or as byproducts from commercial or private uses. TPH may be released directly into water through spills or leaks. Some TPH fractions will float on the water and form surface films. Other TPH fractions will sink to the bottom sediments. Bacteria and microorganisms in the water may break down some of the TPH fractions. Some TPH fractions will move into the soil where they may stay for a long time. back to top ——————————————————————————– How might I be exposed to total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH)? Everyone is exposed to TPH from many sources. Breathing air at gasoline stations, using chemicals at home or work, or using certain pesticides. Drinking water contaminated with TPH. Working in occupations that use petroleum products. Living in an area near a spill or leak of petroleum products. Touching soil contaminated with TPH. back to top ——————————————————————————– How can total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) affect my health? Some of the TPH compounds can affect your central nervous system. One compound can cause headaches and dizziness at high levels in the air. Another compound can cause a nerve disorder called “peripheral neuropathy,” consisting of numbness in the feet and legs. Other TPH compounds can cause effects on the blood, immune system, lungs, skin, and eyes. Animal studies have shown effects on the lungs, central nervous system, liver, and kidney from exposure to TPH compounds. Some TPH compounds have also been shown to affect reproduction and the developing fetus in animals. back to top ——————————————————————————– How likely are total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) to cause cancer? The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has determined that one TPH compound (benzene) is carcinogenic to humans. IARC has determined that other TPH compounds (benzo[a]pyrene and gasoline) are probably and possibly carcinogenic to humans. Most of the other TPH compounds are considered not to be classifiable by IARC. back to top ——————————————————————————– Is there a medical test to show whether I’ve been exposed to total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH)? There is no medical test that shows if you have been exposed to TPH. However, there are methods to determine if you have been exposed to some TPH compounds. Exposure to kerosene can be determined by its smell on the breath or clothing. Benzene can be measured in exhaled air and a breakdown product of benzene can be measured in urine. Other TPH compounds can be measured in blood, urine, breath, and some body tissues. back to top ——————————————————————————– Has the federal government made recommendations to protect human health? There are no regulations or advisories specific to TPH. The following are recommendations for some of the TPH fractions and compounds: The EPA requires that spills or accidental releases into the environment of 10 pounds or more of benzene be reported to the EPA. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration has set an exposure limit of 500 parts of petroleum distillates per million parts of air (500 Morinne January 7, 2008 at 11:56 am hey beautybrain, In your response to Natalie, you state that you do not sell any cosmetics. True enough. But you have links all over your Web site to beauty retail sites. How much are they paying you to advertise for them? Obviously, you are not as unbiased as you so piously proclaim. Gin January 22, 2008 at 12:32 pm Hi, I’ve always loved Vaseline for my eyebrows and feet. However, last summer I put Vick’s VapoRub (sp?) on my skin ~ ankles, neck, and arms to keep gnats and mosquitoes away. Instantly I could taste it in my mouth! Really yucky. Our skin is our largest body organ, so it made sense to me that it was entering my body. For you gardeners: I used it a few more times before I thought of smearing it on a neckscarf, my shirt, pant cuffs, etc to keep the monsters away. I’d really like to know if this is harmful and whether anyone else has had a similar experience? doris February 18, 2008 at 7:50 pm electromagnetic fields all around us from power lines to electric nosepickers are a danger, makeup is a danger, most of the medicines prescribed are dangerous, most everything we eat is contaminated and dangerous. Why weren’t all these things tested BEFORE they were put out for consumption? Don’t bother answering; we all know the answer thebeautybrains February 18, 2008 at 8:00 pm We do? Please enlighten. And when you do, can you show any scientific proof of what you are saying? Christine March 5, 2008 at 8:50 pm Morinne- Just because someone has advertisers doesn’t discredit what they do and why they do it. Faulty logic. About petroleum jelly, isn’t the carcinogen problem related to the the way the petroleum is refined? See http://www.pesticideinfo.org . There is a high correlation with cancer and use of certain petrolatum, but not the kind in vaseline or cosmetic problems. Also it is SO incorrect to say petroleum jelly CAUSES cancer because unless Natalie, R, Chris and Corina have all done studies excising all other variables using a multiple baseline across people and/ or a reversal single case research design… they’d be better off saying there’s a high correlation between a full moon and crazy behavior. And the vicks thingy, google it some more but I remember reading that camphor is not such a bad thing for someone to put on their chest or back or whatever a few times a year, just don’t put spoonfulls of it in hot vapor and inhale it like they did in the blissfully ignorant ol’ days. Crystal March 29, 2008 at 6:47 pm Beautybrains I am assuming that you are a scientist, seems how the title of your website states “Real scientists answer your beauty questions”. If that is the case than as someone who is not a scientist I will not be one to argue with your findings that petroleum jelly does not cause cancer. Just like Doris so pointed out-There are so many products that have been linked to cancer. If there is something in petroleum jelly that causes cancer who am I to just make a deal about this one product. Heck I use deodorant that probably has something in it that causes cancer. I put lotion on my body everyday, and it probably has an ingrediant in it that uses cancer. I have a cell phone and use that everyday, the transmissions probably could cause cancer. I have family members who smoke- gee second hand smoke is known to cause cancer. The very cars we drive emit dangerous toxins and chemicals into the environment and guess what people they cause cancer too. So what am I getting at? There is no way to eliminate all the cancer causing chemicals from our lives. It is great to try to eliminate these so called ingrediants but give it a rest. You would have to go on a crusade to combat all the companies that produce products that contain some kind of ingrediant that is known or possibly causes cancer. Unless you are someone who does not use any kind of product or comes in contact with any man-made prodcut we all are at risk to develop cancer. Just because you are healthy does not mean you can’t get cancer. The best thing is to take a look at your self and live as healthy as possible. We must use our own discretion. We should be thankful that the life expectancy has allowed us to live longer than past generations. I know that people will always be on a mission to create an environment that is healthy and safe and I applaud those who do but come on some things are just so senseless. It is wrong to just target one company. Plus I am sure those who tried to talk crap about beauty brains and petroleum Jelly use other products that themselves cause cancer. To the 11 yr old unless you ride a bike everywhere you go maybe you should talk to your parental supervision with which I am sure drives you where you need to go. The very car that you ride in emits chemicals that are known to cause cancer. For those who also wanted to talk crap to beautybrains, I am wondering if any of you smoke, drink, or drive cars yourselves. If you do shame on you for criticizing PJ while you overlook the everyday activities that are hazardous not only to your health but to the environment and other people. How many times have you read in the paper “man or woman dies from Petroleum Jelly-ingrediant found to be cancerous” NEVER! WHY? because like I said before so many things cause cancer that doctors would not be able to just pinpoint one thing that caused the cancer. Not unless you had a man or woman that was an alcholic and died from liver cancer than generally thats when people say that alcohol was the cause of the cancer or if someone smokes a pack of cigarettes everyday and they die from lung cancer it would probably be safe to say that the cigarettes is what did it. Thank you Tracy April 2, 2008 at 10:06 am Please be aware that any product containing petroleum jelly or a derivative of it is bad for the environment because it is a byproduct of oil the same oil that makes oil and gas for your automobiles. Plus, oil refineries are one of the biggest problems with global warming. That’s the bigger issue, if it’s bad for the environment then it will be bad for you, sooner or later. Who wants to put refined oil on their lips? yuck. find an all natural one that uses fruit and vegetable oils. Burts Bees, etc. cecile April 29, 2008 at 6:08 am organic substances start rotting quickly so they do need preservatives to preserve them in order to have a shelf life TO SELL. Heather June 7, 2008 at 1:44 pm The UK has banned products made with petrolatum. Why take the chance? There are plenty of organic and natural alternatives to anything you can buy these days. Go organic. It’s the best thing you can do for your health and for the planet. thebeautybrains June 8, 2008 at 8:09 pm Can you provide evidence that the UK has banned petrolatum containing products? I know of certain brands sold in the UK that contain petrolatum (like St. Ives for example). Ray June 10, 2008 at 1:42 pm Petrolatum is listed as a probable human carcinogen in the European Union’s Dangerous Substances Directive (UNECE 2004), and its’ use in cosmetics was banned in September 2004. For further information, take a look at this website: http://www.ewg.org/reports/skindeep thebeautybrains June 10, 2008 at 2:03 pm Ray, Thanks for the comments & information. Perhaps you should review the website yourself. The EWG Skin Deep database gives Petrolatum the safest possible score on their hazard scale. They also do not list it as carcinogenic. http://www.cosmeticsdatabase.com/ingredient.php?ingred06=704786 As far as the European ban, you may be inadvertently spreading misinformation. “In Europe (EU) the only restriction on the use of this material is that you have to have a certification from the producer of petroleum jelly that it is free of carcinogens. This is required because SOME methods of production can result in petroleum jelly mixtures that have known cancer causing ingredients in them.” As long as your supplier has certified that it followed the proper manufacturing methods, there is no problem with using petrolatum in Europe. a June 29, 2008 at 2:18 pm its so hard to know what to use anymore in terms of uncarcinogenic cosmetics and lotions. regarding petroleum jelly, is it better then to use the england brands over the US brands just because they have some kind of research or certificate to prove more purity and no carcinogenic compounds in their lotion or pj. how do we know if pj containing products in the US are more pure and uncarcinogenic and safe? Marie July 3, 2008 at 11:54 am I’m sure Vaseline has been thoroughly looked over by the company and I doubt they’d sell something that might cause them trouble in the future. People have been using Vaseline for years and nothing bad has really been mentioned to it. There are so many thing’s that cause Cancer now, so even if your healthy, use natural products you still could be at risk because of the environment and world we live in. Personally I think Vaseline is great and I really don’t think it would cause Cancer, surely they would have checked it all out before they sell it, it’s not all about the money. Also if it was Cancer causing surely we’d know the whole story as they have top scientists working on thing’s like beauty products all the time. Missy July 21, 2008 at 9:11 am I have to agree with Crystal. Just about everything we do, use, eat, can, possibly, cause cancer. Kudos to Tracy for noting that Petroleum Jelly is a derrivative of petroleum aka oil. I have just recently tried to nix products containing petroleum from my shopping list, though I think it’s impossible to do completely. On a separate note, my concern with PJ is more that it just doesn’t work. I know – science says it’s a good moisturizer, because it “locks moisture in” and doesn’t clog pores. However, if it’s acting as a sealant (this is my limited understanding of “locks moisture in”), it’s not allowing your body to expel it’s natural oils across your skin to moisturize. In addition, it’s not allowing your natural oils to expel any dirt or contaminants that may be in your pores. This logic may be more applicable to mineral oil than PJ, but somehow spreading something on my skin, anywhere that seals it, doesn’t appeal to me. However, in fairness, I will say that if I have a cut or bad chap on my lips, PJ does seem to help it heal, though I try to avoid using it every day. To each their own . Natalie – I admire your passion! My hope is that by the time your generation is having children of their own, that we’ll have some better alteratives to petroleum products for everything. Leah Day August 15, 2008 at 2:07 pm I appreciate a nice debate on this issue, and it really does seem like everyone has a different opinion. I certainly agree that if you start pointing fingers at one cosmetic ingredient, you’re soon going to be overwhelmed by all the conflicting information and opinions available on the internet. However, I do take exception at BeautyBrains for your belief that only scientist can do research, only scientist can prove that something is good or bad. Because scientist can be paid off, the evidence they find can be rewritten to sound worse or better than it actually is. Research also requires money, which is usually supplied by the very companies that have a vested interest in the results. If we wait around for scientist to prove everything about the world before we’re allowed to make up our minds about it, we will be long dead before they come out with any information on cosmetic ingredients. Cosmetics and personal care products are purchased more than any other commodity, other than food. I think I can understand why the CTFA (cosmetics, Toiletries, and Fragrances Association) isn’t too keen on having any research done on these ingredients. I also disagree with the AMA that vasaline is good for dry skin. Like Missy said above, “Locking in moisture” can’t be good for your skin. I would rather heal my dry skin with Aloe – a natural healing plant that most people already have in their homes. It’s been used since 300 B.C., which according to your logic, BeautyBrains, is enough to prove that it’s safe if it’s been around a long time. Left Brain August 15, 2008 at 6:18 pm The Beauty Brains do not believe that only scientists can do research. What we do believe is research that done following the scientific method provides the most reliable information. Other forms of research are suspect. Plenty of companies that sell “mineral oil free” products are members of the CTFA (now the PCPC) so your argument that the CTFA isn’t interested in doing research is not supported by the facts. In fact, research is done on mineral oil all the time. It is the control ingredient in nearly all skin moisturization tests. That’s why we know how well it works. You can disagree with the AMA all you want. However, I don’t find your opinion compelling. Kate September 4, 2008 at 8:55 pm I was looking at Lucas’s Pawpaw ointment and instantly smelled the vaseline component. Had me wondering what was actually wrong with vaseline (PJ), since its been around so long. Natural stuff is fine but the preservatives put me off and I do like the texture of PJ. Tracy said that oil refineries were the culprits with “global warming” – but when you consider that ‘global warming’ is the vehicle for a global tax that was agreed on back in 1972 as part of the implementation of the United Nations “Agenda 21″ program (the info’s on the web. The more that I read about this, the more I think that PJ is yet another product that has been swept up in the natural is good, everything else is bad category. And if the science is settled that the world is warming, why is everyone starting to call it ‘climate change’. alice October 3, 2008 at 7:24 am Just wanted to quickly point out… a lot of the medicines/products we use as treatments/for theraputic use can be considered dangerous as well. It’s more or less the dosage and frequency of exposure that determines whether it can be considered poison/hazardous/toxic/etc or safe. Is petroleum jelly bad for the environment because it’s a byproduct of oil? I was under the impression from the discussion that the harsher components were removed hence “refined” being safe for both human use and well also environmentally friendly. (I’d love to see links as well) nellie October 17, 2008 at 3:48 pm petroleum jelly sounds much safer after you look at the ingredient on the back of “natural” lotions and makeup and shampoos ext. I don’t see a lot of truly organic cosmetics . I have to research online then order.(the cost is expensive of course) so if you want to grab something for dry patches on face ,on the go, petroleum jelly sounds GREAT !!! sara October 23, 2008 at 11:08 am thebeautybrains I pity people like you….. people are getting cancer everyday and your advertising for the chemicals that cause it. and Crystal : i’m sorry that there is so many people like you in the world, ” o everything causes cancer, so what lets just live” open your eyes , you can avoid it it’s acctually not hard at all, it might be for lazy people dont care about themselves or the planet. The same people that eat garbage food because cooking is hard for them.. thebeautybrains: what is it that you actually do?? For your information it does not mater what the FDA approves because it does so to benefit big corporations , kinda like what you do.. like aspertame … it’s approved, but is it safe?? i’m sure someone like you would say yes.. good luck in your life, and I wonder if you belive in karma even if you don’t it does come around aXisDenIEd.22 October 31, 2008 at 12:25 am So name something else oil is good for. For many other power sources, there are obvious other uses for the raw or natural form besides human manipulation for fuel. Or is crude oil the strict off limits nectar of the gods. If thats the case, people who wish to stop using crude oil should ban together to worship it. If all life comes from life, then have your “god” be the only one to drink from this fire. All the souls of the dead made this oil and all the genetic predecessors for all life to come… ok, way off track, but a large religious movement would probably be the quickest way to end it. Using good sense would never be good enough a ploy. Find something oil is better for, then demand will rise in that need and hope it is a “cleaner” use. A lot of work went into the evolution to oil’s present composition, we just might be frivolously burning up today what could make a bigger bomb if drawn tomorrow. Why not study a less primitive use. ” I make fire!” Woo hoo, you don’t have to work hard to make fire from that. Will cave man day’s never end. Humans will probably make the best oil since we engorge our life with it now. I doubt the dinosaurs were drawing with crayons, taking medicine in coated bi-products; or any other of the daily oil communion nearly all of us are guilty of in some form. People born today may be blessed with 125 years of crude marination, before their departure, to be born again in a futuristic “refined” cemetery. Save the Planet –kill yourself aXisDenIEd.22 October 31, 2008 at 12:37 am Nobody’s “research” matters. The primitive scientific method that we all learned in grade school, is hydrophobic as well. Any one test can be argued with another’s. 5 experiments show no problem, here’s five that does. One persons desires for results can manipulate them, even to a physical level of machine reading “errors”, affected by someone’s consciousness. Research is pointless, nearly every pro and con has already been said by someone sometime. Just new authors trying to get recognized for inventing the wheel. aXisDenIEd.22 October 31, 2008 at 12:49 am +++ researchers haven’t thrown humans in woodchippers to see what would happen, guess that’s safe. There ARE many published papers, you are lucky your audience is lazy or impartial to using their time to look up the many applicable dangers. Govt agencies like some people on this site mentioned, are not competent, at least to what some think, contrarily the EPA is very competent for its original intention. For example atrazine in public water systems, mix with others chemicals having more severe reactions. The EPA only tests each chemical separately, not combined. Irrational. Cassi December 11, 2008 at 12:51 am Hi everyone I was really concerned with what has been written here as I know someone who puts vaseline all over their body…but I have to say there are so many cancer causing chemicals in foods and products like make up deoderant soaps shampoos not to mention cancer causing parasites and Im not going to mention what we are ingesting them from as it would freak everybody out and it would take a major clean up to lead a perfectly cancer risk free life! ry reading the cure for all cancers, or the cure for all diseases by Hulda Regehr Clark, Ph.D.,N.D. I havent used deoderant for years and I smell way better as deoderant stops sweat glands from working it smothers too and I found I didnt have as much BO build up either after not using it for a while. Imagine spraying those chemicals right around near the breast yuck! Isopropyl alcohol aka(propyl alcohol, propanol, isopropanol and rubbing alcohol)is in most things we put ON our body and even IN our body, theres some scary stuff out there. And what about mouthwash geez it has ethanol in it! Child of God December 21, 2008 at 12:11 am hey im only 13, but heres what i think. drop it already. this is madness. dose it ready mater. god knows when youll die and when you do it means youve done all you could in life. hopefully (should you be a beliver) will go to heaven and there will be no vaseline or any other harmful things. we should just live life and that will be what god asks. however we should stop wasting preasous life here arguwing to do what god has planned for our life. your saying cancer and bactira will shorten my life, well if your here reading or just on the interent your shorting your life. wow by wasting a 5 years of my preaious life i found i can stop doing this and save five years of my life. please dont waste your guys time here. help bring his kingdom here today not argue. may the holy sprit guild you to not be desived and waste time here. dont waste time reasearching and doing expriments, that time would be better spent reading a bible. for those of you reading this and being discusted at my chistain article i pray that one day this will make seanse P.S. beatybrains has kept her mouth shut hafe way throe this. she started it. are yous still here? go and evanglise. save lives with information that way. and i dont mean bring people to my chruch, start good programs at chruch to luwer more people. etc. that is a corupeted chruch and evaglist still being desived. go now. ALOHA Kristen December 22, 2008 at 6:21 pm I would just like to say to everyone coming on this sight and criticizing that you all are NOT scientists. R, if you were a real scentist you would know that the bacteria doesn’t come from petroleum jelly itself. You can touch the PJ and have it become containated. I don’t know if PJ causes cancer or not, and that’s just the thing…NOBODY KNOWS! I don’t beleive companys and the government are “tricking us.” Companies sell cigarettes, yet the government advises us not to smoke them don’t they? There are hundreds of things that are potentially carcogenic. We eat produce treated with pesticides, processed foods with dyes and preservatives, and we drive everywhere for god gods sake! There are things that we consume a lot more of then vaseline, so maybe we should all focus on those things first. Charlotte January 19, 2009 at 12:09 pm My skin is so sensitive that I can’t wear any makeup. Even the so called “natural” cosmetics make me break out in an irritated rash. I haven’t used chap stick in years so when my lips got so chapped that they started to bleed here at work, i walked down to the dollar store and bought a tub of PJ becuase it doesnt irritate. It was $1 (economical) and I don’t think I’m putting myself at risk here by putting this stuff on my lips once in a blue moon. If you Make-up junkies claim you care so much about all the cancer in the world, and that petro products are terrible for the earth, then the next time you drive your car somewhere to unload your paycheck on useless product think about all the fossil fuel burned up in the MANUFACTURE and DISTRIBUTION of those products even if they don’t contain any petro. Then when you’re done you’ll either throw away or recycle the container(which is probably make of plastic=petro). You’ll throw it in a bin made of plastic=petro, it gets hauled either by you or the trash man via fossil fuel to either the dump or the recycling center where it will take tons of fossil fuel to get turned into something else you can spend money on. just buy less stuff people, and let me put the jelly on my lips once a year guilt free. sheesh. dianna February 6, 2009 at 6:48 pm all i have to say is if you have such a concern about ANY product that you feel compelled to ask whether or not it causes cancer then IMO it would be better to not use that product – LOL thebeautybrains February 6, 2009 at 7:45 pm What product/ingredient wouldn’t you wonder about whether it caused cancer? If you analyzed any ingredient, you could easily find traces of mercury in nearly everything. crystal February 8, 2009 at 3:56 am Each is entitled to their own opinion, there are lots of possibly harmful chemical substances out there in cosmetics. I doubt ignorant pro-vaseliners will die of cancer as the risk or correlations with cancer is not big enough to have the stuff pulled off our shelves but cosmetic product companies would never want you to know if there were harmful ingredients in their products wether small or big because they are all about the money. There is actually plausibe research out there despite your view. I will not take your word for vaseline because you sound like you have been payed off, you can argue vaseline is safe all day for all I care because the smarter half of us wont listen to you. PEACE thebeautybrains February 8, 2009 at 6:52 am Rather than disparaging our objectivity by spreading lies about us being paid off by someone (we’re not), why don’t you direct us to the research that proves petrolatum is harmful? We would be happy to change our position if there was scientific evidence. collegestudent February 8, 2009 at 11:12 pm In response to beautybrain’s response to natalie, you said that there are probably lots of companies and people out there trying to link PJ to cancer etc, whatnot, I just want to add that from a simple google search for the link between vaseline and cancer, I found so far only one source that describes a risk, but a closer look reveals that the site is one that SELLS organic products. I’m not saying case closed, that website is the culprit, I’m just saying a simple search on google isn’t real research, you hear new “studies” everyday that says fatty oils is linked to high cholestrol, but then another study might say vegetable oils has high-lip cholestrol content which is health to the heart, etc. But the biggest thign to keep in mind is that link, and risk factors does not mean CAUSATION. For example: you may see studies range from anything like “people who say f-ck alot are more likely to develop arthritis on a tuesday,” then a day later another article would say “people who develop arthritis are more likely to say f-ck alot,” question is does swearing leads to pain, or pain leads to a person venting about the pain by swearing? becky April 15, 2009 at 3:11 pm PJ is safe but the problems are impurities in it like PAH that’s proved causes cancer. In the U.S. no requirement for refinement applies for petrolatum in personal care products! Be aware! Some manufacturers likely choose refined petrolatum low in PAHs, but perhaps some do not. So when you buy a product with PJ in it you don’t know how clean it is or another word how much PAH, ethylene oxide or 1,3-butadiene is in it. http://www.health-report.co.uk/petroleum_petrolatum_health_concerns.htm Karen Seide May 7, 2009 at 9:14 am Little Natalie could not be more correct! I am a holistic doctor and Petroleum Jelly can cause cancer and I clear people of it all the time. Thank you Natalie! ~Karen Chris May 21, 2009 at 5:07 am FACT: Vaseline / Petrolatum / Petroleum Jelly is found in over 50% of cosmetic skincare creams and lotions. FACT: It is used on a daily basis with no risks whatsoever. FACT: Vaseline is a large molecule and is too big to penetrate the skin and be absorbed. When applied, it simply sits on the skin as a protective layer. The so-called scientists and doctors contributing to this discussion should be responsible and stop spreading ridiculous and scaremongering comments. How indeed can it be a carcinogen? It simply forms a protective film/layer when applied and is there until it is washed off. How can that possibly cause links with cancer? Absolute nonsense. So please tell me, when people apply vaseline to their lips (most common use of ‘neat’ vaseline), how indeed it will cause any health problems? It purely coats the lips, preventing dryness. makani June 28, 2009 at 10:21 pm The problem is not the petroleum jelly itself, it’s the contaminants that it contains, which are highly cancerous.

"The Beauty Brains","","Is skin lightening safe by The Beauty Brains Midnite Rain asks… I have dark skin, and i would love to have a much more fairer complexion. I have read that Uva Ursi (Bearberry Extract) is good for lightening African American skin, and I’ve also heard that L-Glutathione is great too. So, if i want to max my skin lightening, is it safe and more efficient to use both at the same time? The Right Brain responds: Midnite’s question prompted a good discussion in our Forum about the various options for lightening/whitening your skin. (There was even a bit of a philosophical argument about whether you SHOULD lighten your skin or not!) You should also understand what ingredients you should NOT use to lighten skin. Mercury is one good example. Mercury compounds like mercurious chloride, mercury oxide and ammoniated mercury can penetrate the skin and deactivate the enzyme involved in melanin production. These chemicals essentially turn off the switch that causes dark spots to appear. Unfortunately, long term use of these products can cause neurological and kidney damage so have banned from cosmetic use. This is a very timely discussion since it was recently discovered that many commercially available brands of skin lighteners still contain illegal levels of mercury. You can read the entire story in the Chicago Tribute .","Is skin lightening safe","ddd08d04077a3e2ef921473a3479e6b02bfa3dde","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2010/05/is-skin-lightening-safe/"

It also makes your scalp itchy and it makes your hair fall out. If you know anything about reading ingredients. You know that the first 5-10 are the main ingredients and have the most impact on your hair. Well, panthenol and panthenyl are in the first 5-10. Which both of these ingredients are pure wax.

Your touching the half to in inch of waxy coating you have developed on you’re hair.well just saying hopefully this is helpful info and im 100% sure its correct cause i asked professionals and im only 13 Sarah Bellum says: Thanks for checking in with the Beauty Brains about your science project. Lefty and Righty have answered questions about Pantene before and they say that the idea that it coats your hair with plastic is a myth started by stylists to keep you from buying salon products. (BTW, Pantene contains silicone, not plastic.) And the notion that when you touch your hair you’re really feeling Pantene is bogus. I don’t know as much about formulation chemistry as Lefty but even I know that there’s NO WAY you’re leaving half inch to an inch of product on your hair. That would be a TON of gunk left behind! No conditioner leaves that much stuff on your hair. We do get a bunch of comments from our readers about Pantene making their hair fall out, but I can’t find any evidence that shows Pantene is causing the problem. (I’m keeping an open mind on this one, however, since SO many people have complained about it. Maybe I can talk Lefty and Righty into revisiting that subject in a future post.) One last thing: if you really want to be “100%” sure” you shouldn’t only talk to professional stylists. And you shouldn’t “only” listen to the Beauty Brains either. Do your own research on the web, read Paula Begoun’s Cosmetic Cop website , contact Pantene and ask them what they say about their products, check with the Society of Cosmetic Chemists . But whatever you do, open your mind and THINK for yourself. It’s hard to be 100% sure of anything. Thanks for your email and best of luck on your project!

As we discussed in previous posts on mineral makeup , there’s a lot of misinformation about the true “mineral purity” of these products. Apparently consumers are catching on to this scam because Datamonitor says that “the increasing number of products on the market with a low mineral content may harm the credibility of this product category…” And their study showed that there were 150 new mineral make-up products launched in 2009!

"The Beauty Brains","2016-01-18 08:26:00","What makes Redken All Soft Conditioner rock? by The Beauty Brains Sarah Speaks: Nothing makes my wavy hair feel as great as using Redken’s All Soft conditioner and I want to know why. I accept that this may be my fate, but I’m not really delighted by spending that much money on conditioner when I swear by cheap shampoo. I aspire to be a beauty brain, so I looked at the ingredients of the $12, 250mL bottle and compared them to the 80-cent, 590mL bottle of White Rain regular conditioner I got at the discount store. White Rain: Water, cetyl alcohol, dicetyldimonium chloride, sorbitol, phenosyethanol, stearyl alcohol, stearamidopropyl dimethylamine, ceteareth-20, behenyl alcohol, fragrance, citric acid (Not many ingredients but they all sound familiar after reading your site for awhile.) All Soft: Active Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Behenalkonium Chloride, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Propylene Glycol Ceteth-3 Acetate, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cetyl Alcohol, PEG 100 Stearate, Glyceryl Stearate, Fragrance, Phenoxyethanol, Cetrimonium Chloride, Dimethicone, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, PPG-5 Ceteth-10, Methylparaben, Ethylparaben, Propylparaben, Disodium EDTA, Taurine, Oleth 10, Disodium Cocamidoproprionate, Lecithin, Phosphoric Acid, Wheat Amino Acids, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Avocado/Persea Gratissima, Hydroxypropyl Trimonium Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Trehalose, Arginine HCI, Orange No. 4 (CI 15510), Yellow 5 (CI 19140) So the marketing folk at Redken say: Avocado Oil = softness & moisture Proteins = help strengthen Amino Acids = deep conditioning But I say, looking at the ingredients, it’s got to be the glycerin. Avocado and proteins are pretty far down the list, and glycerin doesn`t show up in other conditioners, not even in most of Redken`s own other formulas (and nowhere near as high in the ingredient list). Glycerin is moisturizing, So my question is, a) am I right? Is it glycerin that makes my hair rock? If so, then b) what is it doing to rock so hard? And c) how likely am I to find cheaper brands that have it in the first five ingredients? The Right Brain Is Impressed: Wow, Sarah, thanks for one of the best product analysis we’ve seen from any of our Beauty Braniacs. We love it when our loyal readers catch the scientific spirit of what we’re trying to do. Now, let us help you understand even better by dissecting the ingredients in Redkin one by one. There’s a lot of chemical-speak here, so stay with us! Water – the solvent that acts as the carrier for all the other ingredients. Behenalkonium Chloride – a long chain fatty conditioning agent, good for classic conditioning and moisturization. Glycerin – not really functional in rinse off conditoners because it rinses down the drain. (So sorry, but you were wrong about that part!) Cetearyl Alcohol – a thickener/emulsifier that is really a blend of cetyl alcohol and stearyl alcohol. Propylene Glycol Ceteth-3 Acetate – an emulsifier. Cyclopentasiloxane – a type of silicone used as a light conditioner and spreading agent. Cetyl Alcohol – thickener/emulsifier. PEG 100 Stearate, Glyceryl Stearate – more emulsifiers Fragrance – mmmm, smells soft. Cetrimonium Chloride – an inexpensive traditional conditioner. Works well with the Behenalkonium chloride. Dimethicone – a type of high molecular weight silicone that gives a protective layer on hair. Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride – good, mild conditioner made from guar beans. PPG-5 Ceteth-10 – yet another emuslifier. Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Ethylparaben, Propylparaben, Disodium EDTA – preservatives Disodium Cocamidoproprionate – a surfactant that helps disperse the other stuff in the formula. Taurine, Oleth 10, Lecithin, Wheat Amino Acids, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Avocado/Persea Gratissima, Hydroxypropyl Trimonium Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Trehalose, Arginine HCI, – basically featured ingredients that don’t add much, if any, efficacy to the product. Interestingly, Trehalose is a wood fiber that supposedly can replace silicone as a conditioning agent. We’ve tried to make formulations with it and could never get it do to a damn thing! Phosphoric Acid- controls the pH. Orange No. 4 (CI 15510), Yellow 5 (CI 19140) – colorants. Alright, there you have a complete analysis of what each ingredient in the formula does. Which one makes the formula “rock,” as you so eloquently put it? Well, it’s certainly NOT the glycerine, that pretty much rinses off. It’s also not the avocado oil or other ingredients that Redken mentioned. It’s really the multiple conditioners in the formula but if we had to pick one or two we’d say it’s the combination of the Behenalkonium Chloride and the Cyclopentasiloxane.","What makes Redken All Soft Conditioner rock?","b61828f5a20b1ca46e34ecdd8f1313f7bf909dd0","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2006/10/what-makes-redken-all-soft-conditioner-rock/"
"The Beauty Brains","2017-01-15 20:44:00","Is ponds flawless white an effective skin lightener? by The Beauty Brains Begam wants to believe: Does “Pond’s Flawless White Visible Lightening Daily Lotion” really make skin fairer and is it safe to use? The Right Brain preaches about Ponds: Thanks for the question. We’ve never been asked about Ponds, but we have blogged before about products like Definity and Meladerm that use skin lightening technologies. Pond’s Lightening Lotion Ponds is made by Unilever, a major global marketer of personal care products and we have no doubt that they have tested the product to ensure its safety. But does it really work? Let’s examine the ingredients: Ingredients: Water, Isopropyl Myristate, Niacinamide 3%, Stearic acid, Dimethicone, Glyceryl Stearate, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate 1.25% Glycerin, Triethanolamine, Titanium Dioxide 0.2%, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane 0.4%, Phenoxyethanol, Propylparaben, Sodium PCA, Tocopheryl Acetate 0.1%, Sodium Hydroxide , Disodium EDTA, BHT, Cl 14700. Skin lightening technology There are two ingredients we want you to pay attention to: Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate and Niacinamide. The former is a sunscreen. Since skin spots can be triggered by sun exposure, a sun protection cream will help keep your skin fairer. The second ingredient, Niacinamide, has been shown to reduce cutaneous pigmentation (in lab tests) and improve skin lightness (in clinical test) compared with a control vehicle alone after 4 weeks of use. The Beauty Brains bottom line: Based on the research we’ve found there does appear to be evidence that products like Ponds that are based on Niacinamide are effective lighteners.

For example, sun induced melanogenisis is treatable but dark spots caused by acne scars are not.","Is ponds flawless white an effective skin lightener?","a9c925ce9cf30b228add143b25811cf60c4ba88b","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2008/04/is-ponds-flawless-white-an-effective-skin-lightener/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Which AHA is Most Effective? by The Beauty Brains Mo must know… It is very confusing with so many first cousins around of AHAs, Salicylic Acid, Glycolic Acid, Lactic Acid & Ammonium Lactate. Which one is the better one of these? I believe all of them essentially do the same job – They help with itching in KP/Eczema/Psoriasis, slough off dead skin, exfoliate, unplug pores, reduce wrinkles. The Right Brain responds: Mo, we’re sorry to tell you that the answer is none of the above: the best AHA is actually Lactobionic acid. (Ok, technically it’s a Poly Hydroxy Acid but the basic idea of how it works is the same.) Loving lactobionic acid Hopefully all our readers recognize AHA as the abbreviation for Alpha Hydroxy Acid, a class of chemical that is used to loosen dead skin cells and increase cell turnover. According to research published in the Journal of Cosmetic Dermatology , Lactobionic acid is not only more effective than glycolic acid at improving cell turn over but it’s also less irritating. An international team from London, Serbia and Slovenia tested both AHAs in a cream and a gel. 26 volunteers used the products twice a day for two weeks. The researchers found that Lactobionic acid scored better in both forms even though their data indicated the gel base worked a bit better than the cream form. What do YOU think? Do you use AHAs to smooth your skin? Which products do you like? Leave a comment and share your alpha hydroxy affinity with the rest of the Beauty Brains community.

"The Beauty Brains","","Are silicones bad for long hair? by The Beauty Brains Jessica Says: Thanks for taking the time to answer all these questions! It’s a wonderful resource. I belong to a long hair site where there are a number of fanatics who insist that, among other things, -cones (silicone, dimethicone, amodimethicone) are terrible for your hair. I know that you answered a fairly similar question already, but I’d like to be able to give a detailed response to their claims that it a) locks out moisture, b) makes it difficult to see and thus, trim split ends and c) is extremely difficult to remove from hair without stripping it totally dry. Thank you for any help you can give! The Left Brain Responds: Jessica, thanks so much for being a truth-seeker! First, just to set the record straight, “silicone” is the category which covers the ingredients you asked about. Dimethicone is one type of silicone, amodimethicone is another. Cyclomethicone is another. Because of their different chemisty, these silicones have very different properties and can be used in different types of products. So, not all silicones are created equal. Now, let’s deal with your specific questions: a) Do silicones lock out moisture? Yes they can, but they can also lock it IN. Dimethicone in particular, is good at forming a barrier film that can help waterproof your hair. That’s a good thing because you want to lock in hair’s natural moisture but you also want hair to have some resistance against humidity which is one of the major causes of frizz. So, the “myth” you asked about is true, but it’s not necessarily a bad thing. b) Do silicones make it difficult to see split ends so you can’t trim them? Yes, silicone products (espeically silicone serums like Frizz-Ease) do smooth over split ends to make them less visible. THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO! That’s the point!! If you want to trim your split ends you should do it either BEFORE you apply a silicone serum or AFTER you wash it out of your hair. Which brings us to your final question… c) Is silicone extremely hard to wash out of hair without stripping it dry? Under most circumstances silicones will wash out of your hair without much problem. But if you’ve applied multiple products containing high levels of water insoluble silicones, your might have to lather, rinse, repeat before you get it all out. In most cases, the protection you get from using silicones out-weighs the damaging effects of washing them out. The Brains Bottom Line: Despite what stylists and other non-scientists may tell you, silicones are one of the most effective conditioning ingredients you can use on your hair. Period. We defy anyone to present data to the contrary.","Are silicones bad for long hair?","7e2ee588f3a9c8f2f88d2d57915e3f9542ffefdb","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2006/10/are-silicones-bad-for-long-hair/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Henna and other natural plant hair dyes by The Beauty Brains Carrie’s curious: First, I must say your site is amazing. I’ve been looking for years for an evidence- and research-based beauty site. Brilliant. I’d like to know more about henna. You mention it very briefly in the article about “organic” hair dyes but you don’t go much further than that. Can one of “The Brains” do a feature on henna, and any other plant-derived dyes (if there are any) out there? The Right Brain’s response: Ask, Carrie, and you shall receive. We found a great resource for henna information , and it’s heavily annotated with references. We’ll paraphrase some of the key information here to answer your question, but we recommend checking out the site for more details. What is henna Henna is a shrub (Lawsonia Inermis ) whose leaves contain a tannin dye molecule known as Lawsone. Lawsone is released when the leaves are pulverized, acidified and made into a paste. This paste can be applied to hair or skin to give it a deep, reddish brown stain. What colors does henna come in? Despite what you might have heard there is no such thing as black or blonde henna. True henna ONLY comes in reddish brown. Any black or blonde hair dyes that claim to be henna are mixing henna with other materials that could be either other plant dyes or synthetic chemicals. Can I use henna instead of permanent hair colors? Using real henna creates a dark stain will provide long lasting color. However, as noted above, you’re limited to a single color pallet. Also, it won’t bleach color out of your hair. Is henna bad for my hair? No, real henna is not damaging, since it only stains the keratin protein in your hair. But some of the compounded hair dyes use oxidative and metallic compounds which can be damaging to your hair. Are there other natural hair dyes that give different colors? There are other natural dyes that can stain hair but remember these won’t lift color. (Again, they won’t bleach your hair lighter.) Here are the colors of ten natural plant hair dyes listed by hair color. Click the reference links at the bottom for a full description of each. 1. Red/Brown Henna: Lawsonia Inermis Walnut: Juglans regia Catechu: Acacia catechu 2. Blondes/Yellows Cassia obovata: also called “neutral henna” Catechu: Ourouparia gambir Saffron: Crocus sativus L. Chamomile: Anthemis nobilis Rhubarb Root: Rheum rhapoticum 3. Blacks Vashma: partially fermented indigo Karchak: castor bean 4. Blues Indigo: Indigofera tinctoria Woad: Isatis tinctoria The Beauty Brains bottom line It’s cool how many natural hair dyes there are, even though they don’t work as well as the oxidative colors.

"The Beauty Brains","2017-06-29 23:39:00","Lash lengthening lies by The Beauty Brains Scatter Brain says: Yesterday, as I was thumbing through the spring issues of fashion magazines, I came across an advertisement that literally taunted me into writing this little observation of mine. Unseemly lash boosters The ad was for L’Oreal Concentrated Lash Boosting Serum. This product is obviously an over-the-counter rival for prescription brand Latisse. Not that it’s offering the same active ingredients, just similar results at what I would imagine is a much-reduced price. For one thing, you’d skip the trip to the doctor’s office or med-spa. I have no idea if the product really works. I did a little research on-line and customer reviews were mixed from raves to “this product is complete crap.” However, that’s not what I’m here to talk about. I want to point out some VERY interesting wording in the results copy. This ad is an excellent example of how you should really pay attention to wording when reading, watching or listening to advertisements. Here is what the copy said: 71% say It seems I have more lashes 75% say My lashes seem thicker 78% say I have less lash loss during makeup removal 81% say My lashes seem to be in better condition Wow. Those are impressive numbers. So, what’s my problem? My problem is the word “seem.” I believe the technical term in the marketing world for a word like this is “a major butt-covering necessity.” “Seem” changes the whole meaning of the data. If the copy made a rock-solid statement like, “71% say I have more lashes,” I would be more inclined to believe the “fringe benefits” of this product. However, “seem” changes the whole dynamic of the data and makes everything much more tentative. Unfortunately, this was probably very intentional on the part of the writers. L’Oreal is hoping that you’ll just absorb those impressive numbers and not realize that they never actually make a definitive statement. This way, if the product doesn’t really work for some people and these angry lashless folks are sending in poison pen letters, the company can easily “cover their butt” by saying, “We didn’t say it actually did, we just said it seems to.” Still, I’m curious enough to continue to monitor customer reviews. If they skew towards positive, and the price is right, I’m just vain enough about my lashes to give this product a test-run to find out exactly what it “seems” to do for my lashes.

"The Beauty Brains","","Is Nuskin Tru Face worth it? by The Beauty Brains Bembet Is Bamboozled: I am tempted to buy Nuskin skin care. I have oily skin and I want to try their line, specifically the Tru Face Revealing Gel and their Facial Wash with Vitamin C. The brand is really expensive and I am impressed with the ingredients but then again I need you to help me decide. The Right Brain Races To The Rescue: Well Bembet, we’re not impressed with their facial wash. Vitamin C really doesn’t do much from a wash off product, so don’t wash your money down the drain. The Revealing Gel is bit more interesting. While it does seem to rely on hype, at least one of the ingredients in the product, Polyhydroxy Acids or PHAs, has at least some research that indicates its effective. We’d like to see more information before we make a definitive judgement on Nu-skin. Or, we could go with the Cosmetic Cop’s assessment of Nu Skin , who says, and we quote: I can assure you Nu Skin is not a miracle, a cure, the total answer, or even part of the answer for every woman’s skin-care needs. After all, if the products were miraculous for skin care, why did they reformulate and come out with a new line of products making the same claims only with different ingredients? Nevertheless, the people who sell this line want you to believe it can alter your life as well as your skin. Like most of the other lines I’ve reviewed, this one contains some very good products, some useless ones, and some that are simply overpriced and a waste of money. The Brains ‘ Bottom Line: We agree with Cosmetic Cops’s concern about falling for over-priced products but we also think you should keep an open mind and review the scientific data that’s available. Unfortunately, we haven’t seen clear data to prove that the PHA’s and other ingredients in Nu Skin are worth it, so it’s hard to say.","Is Nuskin Tru Face worth it?","bedfe6a8f74fa91ba63fc4c10a875d01ea0ba029","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2006/09/is-nuskin-tru-face-worth-it/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Are philosophy’s peptides actually anti-aging? by The Beauty Brains Drew’s dilemma: I love Philosophy as a brand and I have two questions about their Shelter Sunscreen For Face. First, I don’t see any sunscreens listed as ingredients, yet they claim the product has SPF 30. Is that due to the melanin in the formula? Second, they claim to contain a blend of two peptides that “act in synergy to help restore and maintain the skin’s youthful appearance.” Is there any truth to that statement? I love this site and hope to continue seeing great information here!! The Right Brain’s peptide proposal: Drew thanks for your kind words and for your question. Here’s the scoop: Gimme Shelter To answer your first question, you are correct. We can find no listing of a traditional sunscreen ingredient in this product. That seems a bit odd since they do claim to have a specific SPF value. We doubt it’d due to the melanin because that ingredient is not officially recognized in the OTC monograph. So how they claim SPF 30 without the correct ingredients is a mystery to us too! Your other question is interesting from a technical point of view and ties into one of the newest areas of research for skin care: peptides. The peptide premise As we’ve blogged before, in the generic sense a peptide is simply a small protein. And some kinds of proteins are beneficial to hair and skin because of their film-forming, moisturizing properties. But the latest research indicates that certain peptides can interact with skin to trigger biological activity. For example, there’s a recent paper in the January 2008 issue of Cosmetics and Toiletries entitled “Tetrapeptide Targets Epidermal Cohesion” by G. Pauly, et. al. of Cognis France. (Cognis is a major manufacturer of cosmetic ingredients.) Simply put, the paper states that this peptide (formally known as N-acetyl tetrapeptide-11 or Tetrapeptide-11 for short) can stimulate production of syndecan-1, another biological chemical that helps bind skin cells together. Loss of this cellular adhesion is one of the benchmarks of aging skin. So, less adhesion loss means younger looking and feeling skin. Two kinds of testing To prove their point the researchers used a combination of in vitro and in vivo testing. The in vitro testing showed that Tetrapeptide-11 had the desired effect on skin cells in the lab. And the in vivo testing showed that people showed an improvement in skin quality after using a cream with 3% Tetrapeptide-11 for about 8 weeks. And here’s the important part: the researchers did their testing versus a placebo cream that did not contain the active ingredient. So, the good news is, here’s a breakthrough cosmetic ingredient that seems to really work. The bad news is, this isn’t the blend of peptides that Philosophy uses. They use Palmitoyl Oligopeptide and Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-3 and we could not find supportive research on those ingredients. The Beauty Brains bottom line If you’re looking for a sunscreen, you should make sure the product uses proven SPF ingredients. If you’re looking for anti-aging peptides, look for products that contain 3% Tetrapeptide-11. (We haven’t found any yet, if you see any, let us know!)

"The Beauty Brains","","Is NARS makeup worth the price? by The Beauty Brains Janice asks… As a makeup addict I was wondering if there really is a difference between NARS make up, which every make up artist worships, and something less expensive but good quality like MAC or Lancome. Is NARS really worth the price? The Right Brain replies: For those of you with no NARS knowledge, here’s the quick scoop from their website : At the heart of NARS is François Nars’ mission to empower women to experiment and have fun with makeup by teaching them how to enhance their natural beauty and individual characteristics. An iconoclastic philosophy, Nars believes there are no rules when it comes to beauty; whatever makes you look and feel good is right. NARS has the ability to be many things to many people: a stylish accessory, a guilty pleasure or a makeup wardrobe staple, but it’s a certain allure imparted by François Nars that makes NARS a state of mind and a lifestyle brand for the future. NARS Knowledge All this philosophy aside, are NARS products worth more because they’re “better” formulas? Probably not but it depends on what product you’re talking about and how you define “better.” Let’s look at a couple of examples. If you’re looking at a product that is primarily functional, like the NARS bodywash, then the answer is no. As you can see from the ingredient list, NARS is selling a combination of betaine and lauryl sulfate – the same kind of basic detergent formula that many other companies sell for shampoos and body washes for much cheaper. Aqua (Water), Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Dipropylene Glycol, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Poloxamer 184, Menthol, Citric Acid, Trisodium EDTA, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Betaine, Propylene Glycol, Alcohol, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Barbadensis Extract), Macadamia Ternifolia (Macadamia Ternifolia Nut Oil), Sodium Benzoate, Ethylparaben, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Parfum (Fragrance) There’s no way that this kind of formula is worth $38.00! On the other hand, if you’re looking at a product that is more experiential, like a color cosmetic or fragrance, it may be worth more to you. These products may not be technically or functionally better but they may offer you a sense of style or a color or a packaging element that you can’t find anywhere else. And that elevated experience is worth something extra. How much is that sensory aspect worth? Only you can decide. (Still, $23.00 for a lip gloss seems a bit steep!) The Beauty Brain’s bottom line Be choosey – if you find the perfect blush from NARS that you can’t get anywhere else then maybe it is worth the cash. But don’t waste a lot of money on their other products, like the bodywash example above, because they’re really nothing special. By the way, NARS products are fomulated by Shiseido, so you might check out their products to see if you can find on that’s similar but cheaper!","Is NARS makeup worth the price?","8af73aae4ea58564d046f1692f35a0a2d93176cd","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2010/06/is-nars-makeup-worth-the-price/"

What causes it? The Right Brain’s Milia-tary Response: For those of you who don’t know, Milia is a skin condition that is characterized by small white bumps. The most common types, primary and secondary milia, are keratin filled cysts that are essentially harmless. Unless you have a REALLY bad case as pictured above. Just kidding. Milia are extremely common in infants (but adults get them too) and they believed to be caused by oil producing glands in your skin that are not fully developed. (Here’s a link with more medical details on milia .) What can you do about this problem? We wish there was a miracle cream or lotion but apparently there are no topical or systemic drugs that are proven effective against milia. However, your doctor can treat them surgically, in a process that we can only describe as … yuck: …incision with a cutting-edge needle and manual expression of the contents are effective. This can be performed without local anesthetic. Mmmmm. No anesthetic! So, we’re sad to say, that unless you consider a visit to a dermatologist involving un-anaesthetized surgery as an option, your choices for “effective and cheap” treatment are pretty limited.

"The Beauty Brains","","Hair dyes and cancer: Should you be worried? by The Beauty Brains After reading the Left Brain’s post on the link between hair dye and cancer , I felt pretty good about coloring my hair. But then I saw this article from Cosmetics Design that says a new study shows hair dyes CAN cause cancer . New data on hair dye? According to Cosmetics Design: A small but consistent risk of bladder cancer was reported in male hairdressers and barbers. While the panel was agreed that regular occupational exposure to hair dye increased cancer risk they found data on personal use inconclusive. The evidence was adjudged to be insufficient to make a definitive conclusion on the carcinogenicity of hair dye when exposure is limited to personal use. Clarification or confusion? I was anxious to find out if this study contradicted the Left’s earlier assessment, so I downloaded the full report. (You can find the hair dye report here. ) Now I’m no medical researcher, but I’m even more confused after reading this. Basically it says the panel evaluated 17 different chemicals and rated them by the following criteria: Exposure data (where/how used) Human carcinogenicity data (any proof it causes cancer in humans) Animal carcinogenicity data (any proof it causes cancer in animals) Other relevant data The study evaluates whether or not there is sufficient data to indicate the chemical poses a risk of human or animal carcinogenicity. It also provides an overall assessment that states whether the chemical can be classified as not carcinogenic, possibly carcinogenic, or probably carcinogenic. What does this all mean? Of the 17 chemical reviewed: 10 were not classifiable as to their carcinogenicity 6 where possibly carcinogenic 1 was probably carcinogenic. The one chemical that had any clear indication of human carcinogenicity was 4, 4′-Methylenebis (2-chlorobenzenamine) or MOCA for short. But based on the report, MOCA is not used in hair dyes (and in a quick web search, I couldn’t find any evidence of hair dyes that used MOCA either.) Of the six chemicals that were rated as “possibly carcinogenic” none are listed as being used in hair dyes. (One of them HC Blue 1, was banned from hair dye use in the 1980s. The rest are used in textiles, leather, or wool and one was used in manufacture of pesticides and similar compounds.) So to summarize: The report says there’s no evidence of cancer risk for consumers who color their hair. The report says there is a risk for professional hairdressers and barbers. But looking at the details in the report, I only see risks associated with chemicals that are not used in hair dyes anymore. The Beauty Brains bottom line I’m not trying to come across as a defender of dangerous chemicals, but based on this report it doesn’t seem to me that they’ve shown any link real between the dyes used in hair dyes and cancer. If anyone else has another take on this report (are there any medical research technicians reading this?) please leave a comment for the rest of the Beauty Brains community. –Mid Brain","Hair dyes and cancer: Should you be worried?","8a5572033ac1c1c1acb0ffbab77b4aa31c24a466","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2008/03/hair-dyes-and-cancer-should-you-be-worried/"

I’ve finally gotten comfortable with my bra size but now a new problem has started up. It’s really embarrassing and it sometimes is really painful, I get pimples on my breasts. But mostly I get blackheads and other problems a teenager gets on their face and back. I’ve used acne treatments on it but they never seem to work, do you have any advice, like I should see a doctor or some kind of acne medication that will work? The Right Brain responds: Based on what we’ve heard from our Forum members and seen on other blogs, this is a fairly common problem. Some women notice increased breast acne when they exercise more often. (That’s assuming, of course, that the problem is really acne and not another skin condition. SarahF in the Forum pointed out that hairs that many women get on their nipples might look like blackheads when they first appear. Acne or not, the Beauty Brains are very careful about not giving medical advice, Zombiee, so if this problem bothers you enough that you’re thinking about seeing a doctor you should go ahead and schedule an appointment with a dermatologist. Having said that our Forum members had some advice that you might find helpful: Disabling Mercury recommends exfoliating with a loofa sponge and using Neutrogena’s 3-in-1 Stress Relief gel, a topical salicylic acid treatment.

"Randy Schueller","","What is cyclopentasiloxane by Randy Schueller Kalisa’s quest: The last time I was having my hair done, I asked my stylist to help me find some product for my hair. I told him that I’d tried several different things, but I just can’t achieve the look I’m going for. I want to know how to get that slightly wet, slightly “greasy” look, without it being “crunchy,” and he said, “You need a product with silicone” and sold me something [Bumble & Bumble defrizz] with “cyclopentasiloxane” as the main ingredient. Why do you suppose he recommended silicone and what purpose does it serve in a hair product? The Beauty Brains respond: We’re glad your stylist recommended this silicone because it’s one of our mostest favorite ingredients in the whole wide world! In fact, the Left Brain has even written a short musical tribute to Cyclopenatasiloxane (or ‘Siloxane, as we like to refer to it.) I’m not really supposed to share it with you, but what the heck…. (sung to the tune of the “Troggs’ Wild Thing”) ‘Siloxane…you make my hair shine… You make everything Shiny I said ‘Siloxane… ‘Siloxane, I think I love you But I wanna know for sure Comb in, hair is bright I love you It kind of brings a tear to your eye, doesn’t it? Now, on to your answer. Why is cyclopentasiloxane used in cosmetics? Cyclopentasiloxane (or CPS for short) is one of many types of silicones. In general, silcones are known for their ability to lubricate, waterproof and provide shine. (Think “Armor All” for your head.) There are many types of silcones – some have a very heavy, sticky consistency and others are very lightweight. CPS is a water-thin so it’s very good at dispersing thicker, greasier silicones. For this reason it’s often used in combination with dimethicone. It is also volatile, which means it will evaporate. So, not only does it help spread heavier silicones but it doesn’t leave your hair feeling weighed down after it’s done. In rinse off products CPS is used to create a very lubricious, wet slippery feel. In the kinds of leave on styling products that you asked about, it can give you the wet but not crunchy look you’re seeking. Of course, the other ingredients in the formula make a difference too, but that’s why your stylist recommended something based on CPS. The Beauty Brains bottom line: CPS is one of our fave ingredients – it provides a very elegant feel on the hair, it works well with other ingredients, and it can be used in leave on and rinse off products. What more could you ask for from an ingredient?","What is cyclopentasiloxane","ccc0805de6fa0e46a828e504590dd785b4e45076","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2006/09/what-is-cyclopentasiloxane/"
"admin","None","Is baking soda an effective natural exfolliant by admin NOTE: This article contains some inaccurate information. We no longer recommend the use of baking soda on your face because the high pH can disrupt the skin’s acid mantle. Back by popular demand: here’s our newest member, Forebrain, with another reference-laden post. Enjoy! Julie’s cleansing question: I’ve read a lot about using baking soda to clean and exfoliate your face. Do you have any evidence this works either instead of a cleanser or for an acne treatment? Is there any down side? This is obviously much cheaper than all the fancy treatments out there if it works. Forebrain’s favorable response: I’m so glad you asked this question Julie, I’ve been hearing many great things about all the uses for baking soda as well, it’s use in natural skin care and especially with respect to its exfoliant and cleaning properties! The quick answer is that baking does in fact work as a great exfoliant and may be useful in treating acne. Read on for more details and how you should use it. Chemical and Physical Exfoliants Although many of you already know quite a bit about exfoliating, let’s quickly go over the process and some differences between the chemical and physical methods. The point of exfoliation is to slough off the cells from the top layer of skin and reveal the younger, healthier cells underneath. Some exfoliants contain mild acids such as Alpha Hydroxy Acid (AHA for short), which help renew the skin layer by burning off some of the skin. The effectiveness of these chemical exfoliants depends on the acid concentration, with too low being not effective enough, and too high being damaging to the skin. Physical exfoliants (like brushes or scrubs) on the other hand remove the skin cells from the top layer by physically scraping them off. With physical exfoliants, the level of irritation and potential damage to skin becomes an issue when coarser methods like hard bristled brushes are used. Baking soda (aka sodium bicarbonate) falls under the category of physical exfoliants, and what makes it especially effective is that it is a fine, yet hard powder, making it highly effective at removing the dead skin cells without causing excessive irritation. Chemically speaking, baking soda is acid neutral, and acts a mild buffer which means that it has the ability to neutralize other substances it comes in contact with that are acidic (like vinegar) or basic (like soap). Many people also believe that baking soda has cleaning properties; however, scientific evidence has shown that this is due to baking soda’s physically abrasive nature, and it is not an effective anti-microbial agent. Exfoliating with baking soda To reap the benefits of exfoliating with baking soda, add a teaspoon of the powder to your facial cleanser, mix well, and massage into skin like you would with a commercial exfoliant. Do this 2-3 times a week or as per your regular exfoliation routine. If you notice that your skin is red or irritated afterwards, try putting in less baking soda and use the treatment at night so that your skin has a chance to get back to normal while you sleep. Remember to always moisturize afterwards! Baking soda as an acne treatment While there are numerous testimonials in which people claim that baking soda cleared up their acne when nothing else helped, please remember to take these statements with a grain of salt. We don’t know what else that person had changed in their skin regimen; it’s possible that besides using baking soda they also started drinking more water, switched their cleanser or moisturizer, or maybe even changed the number of times they cleanse their skin per day. Seasonal changes and stress levels also have a very strong impact on how much and how noticeable your acne may be. However, there is some evidence that baking soda may be beneficial in treating acne since just the exfoliating properties of baking soda alone lead to an increased skin cell turnover rate making your acne look less noticeable. Plus, baking soda’s neutralizing properties maybe reduce redness of the skin also reducing the appearance of acne. If you want to try using baking soda as an acne treatment, my recommendation is to use one teaspoon of it in your cleanser at night to exfoliate your skin, as well as make a thicker paste of just baking soda and water and apply it to the acne as a mask for 5-10 minutes or overnight (beware, when it dries the mixture will crumble so you might up wake up to a messy pillow). The Beauty Brains bottom line In summary, all signs point to baking soda being an excellent and cheap physical exfoliant. It is an acid neutralizer and a fine powder, which means that it will be gentle on your skin. Baking soda may also be useful in treating acne when made into a paste and applied to the affected areas although there is not as much scientific evidence to back that up. Please comment if you try out any baking soda treatments to let us know what they were and if they worked for you. And always remember to moisturize!

"The Beauty Brains","2016-02-12 07:16:00","Is Pantene Ice Shine a gimmick? by The Beauty Brains Sophie’s Icy Inquiry: Hey Brains, thanks for answering my question on Pantene a few months ago. Now I’m hearing about their new line of ‘Ice Shine’ which claims to make hair shinier than normal shampoo. I’m suspicious about whether these claims are truly scientific or just made-up marketing gimmicks. The Left Brain’s Thaw-ful Thoughts: Is this a gimmick? You ask that like it’s a bad thing. The beauty industry THRIVES on gimmicks. It couldn’t live without out it. (So does most of capitalism for that matter, but that’s a story for another blog…) Anyway, there’s nothing wrong with a company using a “gimmick” to get your attention. But you need to be a smart shopper so you can tell when a gimmick is being used to catch your attention and when it’s being used to mislead and trick you. That’s why you need The Beauty Brains! P&G, the marketers of Pantene , are very good at coming up with clever gimmicks to catch your attention and Ice Shine is no exception. What’s the fuss all about? Here’s what Pantene tells us about these frigid formulas: (according to their UK website, where Ice Shine originated): “Light dances and sparkles across their surface to glitter and hypnotise the world around. Just think about the way that light bounces off ice on a sunny winter’s day. To truly understand great shine and how it is achieved through a hair care regime, Pantene Pro-V scientists needed to understand the properties of ice. During product development, four key characteristics of ice-like shine were identified: Smoothness The surface shine of a sheet of ice comes directly from its smoothness, any imperfections will severely diminish its sparkle. When it comes to hair, products need to almost polish the surface of the hair follicle to generate true ice-like shine. Purity On fresh, unsullied ice, light simply bounces off the surface. But just the merest finger-print can impact the depth of shine observed. When it comes to hair, products must not impede how the light bounces off. Too much dulling residue will quickly kill hopes of achieving an ice-like shine result. Regularity The aligned crystal structure of ice regulates how light interacts with it and is the key to its amazing shine qualities. Hair is no different. To give hair a strong shine the individual hair fibres should be aligned. Reflectivity This is the final secret to an ice-like shine, and is critical in achieving the appearance of a ‘glow from within’. In ice, the light passes through the surface and is then reflected from within. In the case of hair, the light which penetrates through the surface can then be reflected back by the pigment inside the hair, giving the appearance of inner glow. To do this, the surface of the hair needs to be well hydrated because a dry surface will not allow the light to penetrate through its outer layer . Through discovering distinctive attributes found in ice and spending many hours talking to consumers about what ideal shine really looks like, Pantene Pro-V have developed a complete range of products designed to allow anyone to achieve an ice-like shine, whatever the hair type or style.” What does all this mean? Not a whole lot, really. But, damn, it sounds good. Basically they’re telling you that ice is shiny (which it is) and that their products will make your hair shiny (which they will). A few science facts, a few basic product attributes and – Voila! The magic of “Ice Shine!” But what about the formulas? Surely they must have come up with some new and something different technology to justify this bold new marketing campaign, right? Let’s take a look. Here are the ingredients for the new Ice Shine conditioner and one of Pantene’s “regular” conditioners: Pantene Ice Shine Conditioner: Water, Stearyl Alcohol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Glutamic Acid, Panthenol, Panthenyl Ethyl Ether, Lysine HCL, Methyl Tyrosinate HCl, Histidine, Dimethicone, Benzyl Alcohol, Fragrance, EDTA, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone Pantene Daily Moisture Renewal Conditioner : Water, Stearyl Alcohol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Glutamic Acid, Panthenol, Panthenyl Ethyl Ether, Lysine HCL, Methyl Tyrosinate HCl, Histidine, Dimethicone, Benzyl Alcohol, Fragrance, EDTA, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone . As you can see, these two products use vastly different technologies. Wait, we’re being sarcastic – the ingredients are EXACTLY the same!! P&G doesn’t even PRETEND the products are different. At least we would have added some “icy” sounding ingredients just to make the new formula look different. But for whatever reason, P&G didn’t even think that was necessary. Oh well. The Brain’s Bottom Line: Yes, it looks like ice shine is a gimmick, but it’s kind of a cute gimmick when you see what they have to say. And it’s not like they’re telling you any outrageous lies or anything like that. So, if you like the way Pantene’s other products work give this a try, you’ll probably like it too.

"The Beauty Brains","","The colorful secret of organic hair color by The Beauty Brains Jessica’s colorful question: What makes hair color “organic” and how does it compare to regular box dye and professional haircolor? If organic color is still able to lighten natural hair color, would it need to have ammonia and/or peroxide in it? The Right Brain’s black and white response: As we’ve blogged before , right now there is no specific industry-wide definition of what makes a cosmetic “organic.” Different companies approach organic in different ways: some add organic extracts, others try to limit “harsh” chemicals. So when we saw Jessica’s question about organic hair color we were intrigued. It sounded too good to be true, so we asked her to let us know some specific brands that she had seen. Two of the names she came up were EcoColors and Organic Color Systems . Let’s take a closer look at each. EcoColors Jessica, even though you cited this brand as being organic, we can’t find anything on their website that actually states that. But they do claim their products are designed for people who are worried about the chemicals used in “regular” hair dyes. They also claim that EcoColors are based on soy-derived ingredients. The impression their website gives is that their colors don’t use the same harsh chemicals that “regular” dyes do. Is this true? Not exactly. It is true that one of the key ingredients, dihydroxyethyl soyamine dioleate, is soy-based. But the rest of the formula is a pretty standard combination of ammonium hydroxide and oxidative dyes with a hydrogen peroxide developer. So basically it looks like they’ve formulated their soy ingredient into a standard hair dye base. Organic Color Systems The name of the product says “Organic” but from what we’ve seen on their website, this brand never says that their product is organic. It does, however, contain organic extracts. Ok, so they don’t claim to be organic, but they do claim to be ammonia free. In most coloring products ammonia comes from ammonium hydroxide (even Ecocolors as noted above.) Organic Color Systems is also an oxidative hair color system but they don’t use ammonia to raise the pH, they use a lower pH base in combination with heat. While this can still be damaging to your hair, if you’re sensitive to ammonia, this could be a good option for you. The Beauty Brains bottom line: These two hair coloring lines are trying to appeal to your fear of chemicals by being “Eco” and “Organic.” They may be perfectly fine hair colors, but don’t be fooled into thinking they’re better because they’re organic. To our knowledge it’s impossible to formulate a hair dye that is truly organic. (Henna dyes are about the closest you’ll ever get and those don’t lighten color.) Do you color your hair? At home or in the salon? And what’s your favorite brand?

"The Beauty Brains","2016-02-13 07:58:00","How is baby shampoo different? by The Beauty Brains M Must Know …I’ve been using Johnson & Johnson baby shampoo lately, and my hair feels softer but a little more frizzy. (Before I had been using head and shoulders). My question is: how is J&J baby shampoo different from others? Is it just the lack of lathering agent? The Right Brain Lathers Up A Response: M, baby shampoos are different than most “regular” shampoos because they use milder foaming agents. Let’s look at the key ingredients in the two different shampoos that you mentioned: Johnson & Johnson Baby Shampoo Cleansers: PEG-80 Sorbitan Laurate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Lauroamphoglycinate, PEG 150 Distearate, Sodium Laureth 13 Carboxylate Conditioning Agents: Polyquaternium-10 Head and Shoulders: Active Ingredient for dandruff: Pyrithione Zinc Cleansers: Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Cocamide MEA, Ammonium Laureth Sulfate Conditioning Agents: Dimethicone, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride You’ll notice that the cleansers are very different. H&S and many other shampoos are based on lauryl sulfates to clean and provide lather. But these sulfates are such good detergents that they irritate the cells in your eyes, causing them to burn. Baby shampoos use milder surfactants (known as amphoteric surfactants) that clean without causing that burning sensation – that’s why baby shampoos are labeled “tear-free.” Another characteristic of amphoteric surfactants is that they don’t foam as well as sulfates and they’re not as good at cutting grease. This usually isn’t a problem for babies, but if your hair is really dirty you may have to lather, rinse, repeat. Also, your hair may feel a bit softer because you’re not stripping it as much. (Part of the different feeling comes from the dandruff active too. But H&S does have better conditioning ingredients compared to J&J. That’s probably why you’re getting a few more frizzies. If you have need any more information on detergents, read this post on sulfate-free shampoo OR feel free to to ask our newest team member, Foam Gnome and his sidekick Bubble Boy.* *That last part is not true, I just wrote it to irritate the Left Brain.","How is baby shampoo different?","85a8e4cc2fc2f0cf4ba4359bbe71a48c36107dd0","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2010/06/how-is-baby-shampoo-different/"
"The Beauty Brains","2016-05-03 09:46:00","Is talc bad for you? by The Beauty Brains Andrea Asks: Is talc bad for you? The Right Brain Replies: No Andrea, talk is not bad for you. In fact there is no research at all showing any correlation between speech and the health of your skin and hair, therefore we believe that…what? Oh, TALC, not talk. Sorry, let’s start over… Talc causes cancer. Or at least that’s what some people say. It doesn’t take much web-searching to find an article like this one that claims talc cause ovarian cancer . This article sites a scientific study and then concludes, and we quote: Researchers have found talc particles in ovarian tumors and have found that women with ovarian cancer have used talcum powder in their genital area more frequently than healthy women. That sounds pretty scary! But we looked up the journal that this article referenced and when we read it carefully it’s easy to see that that’s not exactly the conclusion of the researchers. Let’s examine it to see what the researchers REALLY did in the study and what their results were*: 1) First, how was talc applied in this study? Either by direct application to the perineal area after bathing, application to sanitary napkin, or application to a diaphram before storage. This study was NOT concerned with talc applied to the legs, arms, etc. 2) What kind of talc products were studied? There were three types of talc containing powders in this study: a) regular baby powder (which contains just talc and fragrance), b) deodorant powders (which contain talc, deodorizing ingredients, and other minerals including silica, and c) “other” talc containing powders. 3) What did their results show? The study showed that the dedorant powders had the highest correlation to ovarian cancer. Why? They theorize that perhaps it’s related to the deodorizing ingredients or to the silica which has been shown to contain mineral fibers like HAVE been linked to cancer. 5) What was the researchers’ conclusion? The authors state that more tests are necessary before drawing a final conclusion. The Beauty Brains Bottom Line: Is talc bad for you? In the researcher’s own words, the evidence that suggests it can contribute to ovarian cancer is inconclusive. So, there are two key things to learn from today’s post: 1) Testing is inconclusive, but if you’re worried about getting cancer from talc containing products, don’t apply them to your “private parts.” 2) Be very, very careful when interpreting any article that makes a scientific conculsion unless you’ve read the source article yourself and you fully understand it. It’s very easy to for someone else to misinterpret scientific studies of this type and twist the results to make their own point. *Source: Harlow BL, Cramer DW, Bell DA, Welch WR. “Perineal exposure to talc and ovarian cancer risk.” Obstetrics & Gynecology, 80: 19-26, 1992. Two final comments: At one time talc contained traces of asbestos fibers that have been linked to cancer. So any study involving talc should note if it involves the non-asbestiform talc or not. There is also concern that talc causes lung cancer but we can deal with that in a future post.","Is talc bad for you?","8412730c3fe24f329348e25b61d0d7c59bb73c9f","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2006/09/is-talc-bad-for-you/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Breast milk soap: appealing or appalling? by The Beauty Brains Here’s an idea for all you cosmetic “Do-It-Yourself-ers” out there: According to Traditionalmidwife.com , you can make your own soap using breast milk. Not having kids of my own yet it’s hard for me to decide if this idea is appealing or appalling. It could be appealing because there is something natural and wholesome about using mother’s milk. And it could be appalling because this feels kind of like a gimmick that may not necessarily be better for your skin. The science of soap The recipe from the website is for a type of lye soap, which is made by neutralizing oils and fatty acids with high pH sodium hydroxide. (Lye is another name for sodium hydroxide, it’s also sometimes called “caustic.”) Lye soaps have been used for thousand of years and while they do the job they can be very harsh in drying to your skin. For this reason they’ve largely been replaced by modern soap bars which are in, in fact, made with synthetic detergents. These are much milder on your skin. Modern soap bars use synthetic detergents that do not strip as much natural oil from your skin so they leave it better moisturized. While I give the midwife a lot of creative credit for coming up with the idea, I’m not sure it’s better for tender baby butts or not. And here are a few other concerns you should be aware of if you’re planning on making soap from breast milk. Be aware of the bio-hazards associated with using someone else’s breast milk for soap making. Use precautions when handling raw, unpasteurized human milk. You will need to pump and store your milk in the freezer until you have at least one cup or as much as 6 cups. Add a little beer to your diet, it might help production! The quality and texture of frozen milk may vary after it’s thawed. What do YOU think about the idea of breast milk soap?

"The Beauty Brains","","Is cayenne pepper good for your scalp? by The Beauty Brains JazzyFresh says… I read that cayenne pepper aids in circulation and stimulating blood flow. I’ve heard of many people adding cayenne pepper to hair oils (esp. Ayurvedic oils) and massaging it into the scalp to stimulate hair growth. I wonder if there is any science to this? The Left Brain answers: Surprisingly, there is some science linking pepper oil to hair growth, but it doesn’t work quite in the way you described. Peppery Prose According to a study entitled “Administration of capsaicin and isoflavone promotes hair growth by increasing insulin-like growth factor-I production in mice and in humans with alopecia,” researchers have hypothesized that capsaicin, the active ingredient in red pepper oil, can activate the insulin-like growth factors that help control hair growth. They tested this hypothesis by treating balding mice and humans with a mixture of capsaicin and isoflavone. The results showed that after 5 months the treatment not only boosted the correct biochemical markers (e.g., IGF-I) but also actually increased hair growth. Here’s the catch: on mice the pepper/isoflavone mixture was administered subcutaneously (injected under the skin as opposed to applied topically) and in humans it was given orally. So the best research to date shows no indication that pepper oil is good for your scalp when it’s just rubbed on your skin. Of course this is just a single study, but it does give me hope that this could really work if we could just identify a way to enhance the penetration of capsaicin (perhaps using some type of nanosome).","Is cayenne pepper good for your scalp?","deb7e4367a9a9422a24903360d4740d0d5cae63f","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2010/06/is-cayenne-pepper-good-for-your-scalp/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Is hair coloring safe? by The Beauty Brains Helen’s Hunting For An Answer: Hi – I just got my hair colored for the first time this week at age 60, and I want to know about the chemical differences between temporary and permanent hair colors and whether there are any safety issues I should know about. Brown is the particular color I’m interested in. The Right Brain Responds: Congrats on your new hair color; let us know how that works out for you! Basically the difference between temporary and permanent colors is that the temporary colors just stain the outside of your hair and the permanent colors (also known as oxidative dyes) get inside the hair. As the names imply, the temp color washes out pretty quickly and the permanent colors stay inside your hair until it grows out. That’s the good news about permanent colors. The bad news is that in order get inside the hair, the dying process swells the hair, thus damaging it’s internal protein structure. This swelling leaves your hair weaker and more brittle after you’ve colored it. As long as you don’t color too frequently, you’ll be alright. But if you start changing shades every few weeks, you’ll see a lot of hair loss due to breakage. (This is true for brown, red and blonde shades.) As far as safety is concerned, make sure you’re not allergic to any of the dyes before you use them on your hair. This is typically done by applying the product to a small, unobtrusive area of your skin. If you develop a redness or irritation, don’t use the product on your hair. (If you’re having your hair colored in a salon your stylist should take care of this for you.) Finally, there are rumors floating around the internet about hair dyes causing cancer, etc., but none of those have been shown to be true. You can read more about hair dyes and cancer here.","Is hair coloring safe?","4adf979e37d358327f26542aefe5fb341ddfcf64","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2006/09/is-hair-coloring-safe/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Is menthol lip balm bad for you? by The Beauty Brains Today’s question and answer post is brought to us by Forebrain, the newest lobe of the Beauty Brains. Please join us in welcoming Forebrain to the Beauty Brains community! Michelle’s menthol madness: I heard from a friend that the menthol in products, such as lip balm and face wash, is actually irritating, and the tingling effect that one feels is your face or lips or whatever getting chapped. I figure that menthol can irritate your skin, but is it really harmful to the skin? Forebrain’s inaugural response: Your friend is only partially right. Menthol may sometimes be irritating, but the cooling sensation that you feel when you use menthol-containing lip balm or facewash is not because your skin is getting chapped. The sensation is actually caused by the effect of the menthol on your nerve endings. How does menthol work? The menthol that is used in cosmetics is a member of the alcohol family and is either synthetically made or derived from peppermint oil. When it is applied to the skin, its chemical structure allows it to quickly penetrate the skin layers and stimulate the cold-sensing nerve endings in the skin, creating a cooling sensation. In fact, you may have noticed that menthol is usually one of the active ingredients in topical anesthetics and anti-itch creams since it reduces the burning and irritating sensations in the skin. So if menthol soothes, why does it irritate? Despite menthol’s scientifically proven anti-irritant properties, a surprising number of people report it to be highly irritating in cosmetics. There are several different reasons for this, the following three being the most common: Menthol is an alcohol, a compound family known for its drying properties in the skin. For some people menthol dehydrates the skin or lips and makes them feel chapped and irritated. The irritation may also be due to the skin’s allergic reaction to the menthol itself, in which case you should definitely stay away from products containing menthol to keep your skin happy. Finally, menthol is able to quickly penetrate the skin layers sometimes carrying other chemical compounds with it. (Some medication creams even use menthol to deliver medicine through the skin and into the body!) It is possible that the irritation you feel comes not from the menthol itself, but from one of the other ingredients that penetrated the skin along with it. Check the product label to make sure there are no other irritating ingredients present and proceed with caution. The Beauty Brains bottom line As far as I can tell, there is no scientific evidence showing that menthol is harmful to the skin or lips when used in cosmetics aside from dryness and mild irritation in some. However, since everyone’s body and metabolism are slightly different, it is not surprising that menthol may create a cooling sensation in some people, and skin irritation in others. Your best bet is to always do a patch test before you begin using any new product, especially if it has ingredients that you are unsure about. If you do find that menthol-containing products cause irritation then I would recommend staying away from camphor as well since it will likely irritate your skin or lips also. Cool fact (no pun intended): When menthol activates the cold-receptors in the skin (or lips or tongue), you perceive other cold sensations as even colder!

"The Beauty Brains","","Do Lush shampoos build up on hair? by The Beauty Brains Sue’s shampoo supposition… Do shampoos that don’t contain silicones also leave buildup in the hair over time? If so, what is it that builds up? I’m wondering specifically about LUSH solid shampoos. I’ve read reviews in which users complain of buildup — but of what? The Right Brain’s reply: In general, modern liquid shampoos don’t create a buildup problem. That’s a popular belief, but there’s very little scientific evidence to back it up. But could LUSH ‘s solid shampoos cause buildup? Theoretically, yes. Let’s take a look at the key ingredients in their Godiva shampoo that make this product a solid. LUSH ingredients Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Cocoa Butter, Cetearyl Alcohol, Glycerl Stearate & Peg – 100 Stearate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid What does this mean? Some of these ingredients like SLS, you would find in a typical liquid shampoo. But the others are waxy type ingredients that are added only to allow the shampoo to be made into a solid bar. Being waxy type materials, they are not water soluble (if they were too water soluble, the bar would fall apart in the shower the first time you used it.) Now, since these ingredients are not water soluble, they may not rinse completely from the hair, thus causing the buildup that you mentioned. Regular liquid shampoos would not have this problem since they don’t use these kinds of ingredients. Is that bad? Wouldn’t this waxy stuff also condition your hair? Maybe, but there are much more effective conditioning materials for shampoo systems. The Beauty Brains bottom line Lush Shampoo Bars are very cool products – they smell great and they’re fun to use. But if you notice build up when you use them, it’s probably because of the ingredients used to make the bars solid.","Do Lush shampoos build up on hair?","62838b9d52c618fe41d91a4ee4024eb691d47ae5","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2010/06/do-lush-shampoos-build-up-on-hair/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Is Hair Coloring Safe? by The Beauty Brains Helen’s Hunting For An Answer: Hi – I just got my hair colored for the first time this week at age 60, and I want to know about the chemical differences between temporary and permanent hair colors and whether there are any safety issues I should know about. Brown is the particular color I’m interested in. The Right Brain Responds: Congrats on your new hair color; let us know how that works out for you! Basically the difference between temporary and permanent colors is that the temporary colors just stain the outside of your hair and the permanent colors (also known as oxidative dyes) get inside the hair. As the names imply, the temp color washes out pretty quickly and the permanent colors stay inside your hair until it grows out. That’s the good news about permanent colors. The bad news is that in order get inside the hair, the dying process swells the hair, thus damaging it’s internal protein structure. This swelling leaves your hair weaker and more brittle after you’ve colored it. As long as you don’t color too frequently, you’ll be alright. But if you start changing shades every few weeks, you’ll see a lot of hair loss due to breakage. (This is true for brown, red and blonde shades.) As far as safety is concerned, make sure you’re not allergic to any of the dyes before you use them on your hair. This is typically done by applying the product to a small, unobtrusive area of your skin. If you develop a redness or irritation, don’t use the product on your hair. (If you’re having your hair colored in a salon your stylist should take care of this for you.) Finally, there are rumors floating around the internet about hair dyes causing cancer, etc., but none of those have been shown to be true. You can read more about hair dyes and cancer here.","Is Hair Coloring Safe?","d313cfb9a39c3c584ab1e63ed1d9c5dcb2d6c386","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2006/09/is-hair-coloring-safe-2/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Top Ten iPhone Beauty Apps by The Beauty Brains Forget the Climate Change Catastrophe. Forget the Gulf Oil Spill scandal. The BIG news last week was the release of the new iPhone 4! What, you ask, does that have to do with our beauty science blog? Because the iPhone offers unique ways to increase your beauty knowledge and make you a smarter shopper – and that’s what the Beauty Brains are all about. Ok, maybe these Apps won’t really make you any smarter, but they could be a lot of fun anyway. So, without further ado, we present our list of the Top Ten iPhone Beauty Apps! Top Ten iPhone Beauty Apps Cosmetifique (Free) 1. Cosmetifique is a searchable database of over 5,000 ingredients in the International Nomenclature for Cosmetic Ingredients format, the official naming convention for cosmetic ingredients. You simply type in the ingredient of choice and the search results show up as red, orange or green to indicate whether the ingredient is great, good, or bad. We love the idea, but were concerned that the information is presented with an unscientific bias toward so-called natural ingredients. 2. Beauty Calls ($0.99) Not to be confused with “Booty Calls” this App not only provides beauty tips and home recipes, but also digital coupons! You can actually MAKE money with this App. 3. Beauty Product Reviews (Free) This is a 3 Star freebie that helps you figure out which new beauty product to buy. They claim to have over a quarter of a million of reviews on almost 50,000 different products! All your fave brands like M.A.C. and Clinique are here (and heck it’s free!) so check it out. 4. Beauty Minder ($1.99) Need an easier way to track your beauty appointments? Then Beauty Minder is THE App for you. It keeps tabs of all your beauty resources like you stylist appointments, favorite nail colors, and the birthday of that guy at the mall who waxes your lip. There’s even a handy mapping function in case you forget how to get to Sephora. 5 OPI (Free) The eponymous OPI App is a straightforward, but handy, little App that helps you select nail colors. You can browse and search over 200 OPI Nail Lacquer shades right from your iPhone or iPod Touch. You can even virtually try on colors by customizing the screen to match your skin tone. The feature is supposed to more closely represent how any given nail color will look on you. This ability to customize the app to your tastes is certainly an appealing feature, but this kind of “try before you buy” approach is limited by the companies ability to accurately capture YOUR individual skin tone. 6. Are You Hot or Not? ($0.99) As the name implies, this App is designed to”rate your beauty.” Use at the risk of over (or under) inflating your self esteem. File this one under V for Vanity. 7. iPerfumer (Free) World renowned fragrance house Givaudan, has created an App that helps you find new fragrances that you love by keeping track of the kind of fragrances that you know you like. When you’re in the mood to buy a new perfume it searches a database of 4,000 fine fragrances for similar scents that fit your taste. 8. Fat Booth ($0.99) This bizarre “see-what-you’d-look-like-if-you-gain-a-bunch-of-weight App is kind of the the evil twin of “Are You Hot or Not.” This one is included for tongue-in-cheek value only – we don’t want to be responsible for inspiring any eating disorders. (Yes, Sarah Bellum, we’re talking about you!) 9. Beauty 911 ($1.99) We love the idea of an iPhone App to deal with beauty “emergencies.” We’re just not sure what constitutes a legitimate beauty 911 situation. Still, since it’s endorsed by a former Major National Pagent winner, you just KNOW it’s worth two bucks. 10. Hair Make Over ($1.99) Our list of beauty Apps wouldn’t be complete without one that let’s you try on virtual hairstyles. Hair Make Over has over 250 different hair styles that you can try on in less than a minute. (I assume that that’s a minute each, not a minute for all 250.) So whip out this bad boy next time you head over to the Hair Cuttery. (That’s where the Left Brain goes for a new “do.”) Remember, if you buy any Apps through our links you’re helping to support the Beauty Brains!","Top Ten iPhone Beauty Apps","96905ab957f18af605f12418f7200b5330728e4f","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2010/06/top-ten-iphone-beauty-apps/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Does the split ender really work? by The Beauty Brains Sandy Says: What do you think of the Split-ender? Can the machine actually differentiate healthy hair from split ends? Do the rotating blades actually cut hair properly? The Right Brain Responds: We have to admit that intitially we though the “Split-ender” was either some kind of football position or the title of a gay porn movie. But in reality, it’s a device that cuts split ends from your hair without trimming the overall length. If you haven’t seen it, check out the TV commercial for the Split-ender. The Beauty Brains are trying to get their hands on this handy device so we can test it. In the meanwhile, if anyone out there has used it, let us know what you think.","Does the split ender really work?","067633fd0856e7e3819f216d95b95deedc4bcd59","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2006/09/does-the-split-ender-really-work/"
"The Beauty Brains","","What’s the best way to slick back my hair? by The Beauty Brains Jimmy’s just curious… I’m a guy with thick, poofy wavy hair and I love the straight, slicked back look. I’ve used Pantene’s in control shaping mousse to slick my hair and it seemed to work okay, but the mousse said it was for people who had fine, limp hair that needed body. Should I continue to use this mousse or not? Second, I was watching a movie where a guy had thick wavy hair like mine and at the end he had slick straight hair. Do you have any idea what they might have used to make his hair change like that? Third, I saw this expensive gel called Phyto sculpting gel and was wondering whether it might help me acheive the slick look or whether I should buy Garnier’s Fructis wet gel, which is much cheaper. The Right Brain tries to help: Hi Jimmy, thanks for reading. We usually only answer questions about the science of cosmetic products not about how how to achieve a certain style or look. But since we don’t get too many questions from guys, we thought we’d answer yours anyway. So here you go… 1) People with fine thin hair often like to work mousse through their hair before blowdrying so they can get more volume. But there’s nothing wrong with using a mousse on thick wavy hair. So if you like the way Pantene works on your hair, use it! 2) We don’t know what movie you were watching, but we do know that the Hollywood stylists hired by the movie industry are granted access to secret government styling technology that will keep the movie star’s hair looking better than any product… Aww, we’re just yanking your chain! They probably just used a good gel. Which brings us to our next answer: 3) Yes, there is a difference in the way different gels hold hair. Some gels use a high resin level to give a very, very stiff hold while others add conditioning agents that make the hold feel softer. In either case, Phyto Gel is ridiculously overpriced. Shop around and you can find something much cheaper that you’ll like. Garnier’s Frucits is as good as place as any to start. If you find two different styling products that you like, you can even try mixing them for special effects.","What’s the best way to slick back my hair?","98166488571abd9df0660421ac452e63857090b7","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2010/07/whats-the-best-way-to-slick-back-my-hair/"

"The Beauty Brains","","When should I start using anti-wrinkle products? by The Beauty Brains Lucia longs to know… I’ve heard that you should start using antiaging products in your twenties, so you’ll get less wrinkles, is that true? If so, will using a Retinol cream at night and moisturizer with SPF 30 during the day enough? I wanted to add some brightening formulas (like Vitamin C or Glucosamine), but not sure if I should or when. I’ve been a beauty junkie since I have memory (Believe it or not I started cleansing and moisturizing twice daily at the age of 10), and I have recently found that I don’t have enough time in the day to use all the products I read you “should” use in the magazines. The Right Brain rejoices: You’ve been moisturizing since age 10? Wow, you are a beauty junkie! (Hey, that’s not a bad name for a blog – The Beauty Junkie. Hmmm.) Anyway, you’re not alone in that feeling – a survey by the Environmental Working Group found that the average woman uses 12 products per day , and that one woman in four uses at least 15 products. Junkies indeed! And you’re right about not having time in the day to use all the products you “should.” Another recent study showed that if you were to use all the beauty products recommended in the July 2006 issue of Vogue, it would require 19.5 hours of application time each day. And that’s just for the skin care!* But seriously, the single most important anti-aging precaution for your skin is to guard it from the sun. You don’t need to use a retinoic acid treatment in your twenties to prevent the wrinkles that will develop in your forties and unless you have really dry skin, you don’t need to moisturize daily. Niether do you need to rub vitamin C on your skin and there’s NO WAY you need to apply glucoasmine (that molecule is way to big to penetrate your skin and it dosn’t do anything just sitting on the surface.) What you DO need to do is protect against UV radiation which has a long term affect on the appearance and physical condition of your skin. So a daily moisturizer with SPF 30 is a good precaution. The Beauty Brains bottom line Diligent use of a a good sunscreen (perhaps combined with an appropriate antioxidant) is the best way to protect your skin from aging effects, including wrinkles.

"The Beauty Brains","None","Does Provitamin B5 (aka Panthenol) condition hair? by The Beauty Brains Kelvin Queries: Hi, I would like to know if Vitamin B5 (Panthenoic acid/Panthenol) plays a role in the hair conditioning (any theories behind) ? If so, how significant is it or is it the active ingredient? The Right Brain Bashes B5 A Bit: As our regular readers know, vitamins in hair care products do not really provide much of a benefit. They’re used to catch consumers’ attention and to support the story behind the product. Panthenol can be considered the king of all hair care vitamins because that’s where Pantene, one of the leading hair care brands in the world, gets its name. In reality, Panthenol is a provitamin, not a vitamin, because it is the product of pantothenic acid (Vitamin B5) and alcohol. When panthenol is metabolized by living cells, it releases Vitamin B5. But on hair, it stays in its Provitamin form. This ingredient has been used for years in hair care products because of its alleged ability to penetrate, strengthen, and thicken hair. However, there’s not much evidence that this provitamin really has a significant effect on hair at all. The results of studies that have been done are not very clear. Why not? Well, it’s kind of messy – some tests were conducted with high concentrations of Pathenol that are not typically used in commercial products. Other studies used more appropriate levels, but let the hair soak in the solution rather than rinsing. And finally, even when used at a high enough level, even when left on hair, there’s still conflicting data whether or not it has a significant effect on hair’s tensile properties. But back to Pantene. Surely P&G , the makers of Pantene, must have data to show how good it is on hair. You can go here to read exactly what P&G says, which is basically “it’s known for its revitalizing and conditioning effects in the hair and skin, Panthenol has humectant-like properties that promote moisture absorption…” Hmmm, we wonder, if they had solid research data would they share it publicly? The Brains ‘ Bottom Line: It’s tough to find clear evidence that pathenol is really helping your hair. As we’ve discussed before, using a good conditioner and protecting your hair from damage is the best thing you can do . Vitamins like B5 don’t significantly contribute to that process. If you want to read about what panthenol really DOES do, go check it out here at PDRhealth.","Does Provitamin B5 (aka Panthenol) condition hair?","5428dc7483387a6da0eee79f84d64ad053fb2f8f","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2006/09/does-provitamin-b5-aka-panthenol-condition-hair/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Does Mario Badescu Drying Lotion really dry up acne? by The Beauty Brains Reul Ruminates.. .What do you think about Mario Badescu Drying Lotion? Once again… an expensive product that claims to help acne. So does it really do more than OTC benzoyl peroxide? The Right Brain responds: Based on a review of the ingredients, Drying Lotion will dry your skin more than a typical OTC benzoyl peroxide lotion. Why? Let’s look at what it contains. Acne Drying Lotion Ingredients Isopropyl Alcohol – very drying to skin because it dissolves skin’s natural lipids. Deionized Water – ok, no problem there. Calamine – a drying agent used on itchy skin conditions like poison ivy. Camphor – an anti-itch agent, can also be irritating. Colloidal Sulfur – a keratolytic agent which means it can help exfolliate. Salicylic Acid – OTC approved acne fighting ingredient, but can be drying and irritating. Glycerine – humectant to bind moisture to the skin. Zinc Oxide – skin protectant. Titanium Dioxide and Talc – probably used to enhance a powdery feeling on skin. Titanium dioxide can be a sunblock if present in sufficient quantities. Ok, what the heck does all that mean? It means that this product contains multiple drying agents and can over-dry and irritate your skin. So to answer you question, yes this product is likely to dry up your zits better than a typical over the counter acne product. But that’s bad because it may leave your skin in worse condition than before! The Cosmetic Cop has even harsher things to say about ol’ Mario – read her entire blistering review here. The Beauty Brains bottom line There are certainly other acne products that will leave your skin in better condition than Mario’s.","Does Mario Badescu Drying Lotion really dry up acne?","8619a1710c9dc4532a9afa61b5a09a3fc7391e2f","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2010/07/does-mario-badescu-drying-lotion-really-dry-up-acne/"
"The Beauty Brains","","How does Differin help acne, and will it help wrinkles? by The Beauty Brains Sarah’s Story: My doctor just prescribed Differin for my acne and for acne scarring. I’m wondering how exactly it works on my skin. Also, I understand it will cause my skin cells to regenerate faster, is it at all helpful for wrinkles then? The Right Brain’s Response: According to the Galderma, the manufacturer of Differin, this drug (and we quote) “is thought to work deep inside your pores to control the cause of the buildup that leads to the formation of acne.” Wait a minute. Did they just say it is “THOUGHT” to work inside the pores??? Can’t Galaderm be a teensy bit more definitive than that? We don’t know about you, but that doesn’t inspire a lot of confidence in us! Aw, what the heck – maybe we’re too critical. Considering this is an FDA approved drug it’s probably just fine. Right? But back to the rest of their quote: The source goes on to say that the drug “normalizes the improper accumulation of skin cells that plug the pores, and effectively keeps them clear” and that it not only helps “prevent the formation of new acne lesions, it can also help get rid of the lesions that are already present.” So does it really work on acne? Judge for yourself by taking a look at the before and after pictures that we *ahem* borrowed directly from their website. The good news is that seems to effective in reducing severe acne. The bad news is, based on these pictures, it apparently causes blindness by painful scarring of the eyes. Oh well, beauty has its price. But you really want to know if Differin work on wrinkles, don’t you Sarah? Well, w e don’t see why it would. If the mode of action of this product is to clear the pores of debris, there’s no reason we can think of why that would affect wrinkles. It doesn’t appear to be an exfolliant like an AHA. (This might be interesting question to ask the folks at Wrinkle Cream Review. ) The Brains ‘ Bottom Line: Sarah, since you’ve already got a prescription, why don’t you try it on your bad self and let us know if you look less pruney. (Assuming you’ve got wrinkles in the first place.) Write back and tell us how that works out for you.","How does Differin help acne, and will it help wrinkles?","acea18b6ec30122edaf4ef6f979881bae4a4096b","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2006/09/how-does-differin-help-acne-and-will-it-help-wrinkles/"
"The Beauty Brains","","The reason armpit hair doesn’t grow down to your knees by The Beauty Brains Li longs to learn: How does hair know when to grow? When you shave your legs, it grows back but it stops growing after a certain length. If you shave it again, it will grow back to that length. What’s up with that??? The Left Brain leads her: Li, actually your question is easy to answer once you understand two things: 3 stages of hair growth The first thing to know is that hair goes through 3 different stages as it grows: Anagen, Catagen and Telogen phases. The Anagen stage (that’s Anagen, not Anakin!) is the stage where the hair grows like crazy. This stage can last a up to 4 to 6 years and can produce scalp hairs that grow to be almost 3 feet in length! (that’s 100 cm for our international readers). And if you think 3 feet is impressive, you ain’t seen nothin’! Human scalp hair longer than 5 feet has been reported! Yikes! We’d hate to see the bill from her stylist! The Catagen stage follows the Anagen stage. This is basically a transitional stage which means the follicle is slowing down production of the hair, not much happens here. The third stage is the Telogen, or resting, stage. The hair stops growing and just sits there in the follicle. When the cycle starts all over again with Anagen phase, the old hair is pushed out by the new hair. That’s one of the reasons you normally shed about 100 or so hairs each day – the old ones are getting replaced by the new ones. Two types of hairs Ok, second thing to understand is that there are two different types of hairs: Terminal and Vellus. Terminal are long hairs (the 3 footers we mentioned) and are thicker and have a longer growing cycle (growing season like flowers) 6 to 8 years. Meaning most of the time they are in Anagen phase. These are found on the scalp, mostly. Terminal hairs are the kind you have to cut because they get too long. Vellus on the other hand are short hairs (a millimeter or less) they are very fine, and they have a very short life cycle, which means they spend most of the time in the Telogen phase. That also means they’ll never grow as long as scalp hair. These very fine hairs are found on “hairless” parts of the body like arms and legs. (Ok, those areas aren’t hairless, but they kind of look hairless because the hairs are so tiny and fine.) So, to answer your question, that’s how hair knows when to grow – it’s determined by the type of hair and the stage of growth it’s in. Which of course is determined by hormones. Isn’t everything?","The reason armpit hair doesn’t grow down to your knees","afd633abf55f90f9f25991714676c14957b25fa8","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2010/07/the-reason-armpit-hair-doesnt-grow-down-to-your-knees/"
"Perry Romanowski","","Does waxing reduce hair growth by Perry Romanowski Kay’s question… I know it’s an old wives’ tale that shaving makes your hair grow in faster and thicker but I’m beginning to think that waxing is the new wives’ tale. I have been waxing my legs for years and have yet to see hair grow in thinner or take longer to grow back in. Is there any relationship between waxing and less hair growth? The Beauty Brains respond: I wish we could give you a definitive answer here but there seems to be a bit of scientific controversy in Wax-land. While everyone agrees that waxing is an effective method of epilation, they disagree on whether it makes the regrowth better or worse! Some sources, like Onlinesurgery.com say that waxing causes repeated damage to the hair follicles that may result in permanent reduction of unwanted hair. But other research, like this article from the Symposium of Adolescent Gynecology and Endocrinology discusses the possibility that waxing actually has the reverse affect: that it can trigger hair to change from the vellus type (fine thin hair) to the terminal type (scalp and beard hair). The only consistent data appears to be that the results vary depending on the person and the location of the body hair. Leg hair may become more fine with time while lip and eyebrow hair may grow thicker. Everyone has their opinion but apparently there’s no definitive answer in the scientific community.

"The Beauty Brains","","How to cure itchy scalp by The Beauty Brains Taya’s trouble… Dear Beauty Brains, I just read up on your article about smelly scalps and wanted to know if there are any causes or solutions to itchy scalps. My sister started developing an itchy scalp several months back and it would sometimes get so itchy she would have to shower twice a day and she would also itch her hair/head in her sleep! One time she was so desperate that she put socks on her hands to stop her from itching. The weather doesn’t seem to affect it and she doesn’t produce a lot of dandruff and her hair looks normal in every way just the itching. We have checked for lice and there are none. She also had two spots on her head before this. My conclusion maybe, that we have a faulty shower – which can get really hot – and my sister and mother are the only two who for some reason can deal with hot water. Which seems to be the most plausible explanation. At first I thought that buying her some deep-cleanse shampoo would do the trick but it didn’t really work. We don’t think it’s that much of a deal unless she actually makes her scalp bleed (which thank goodness has not happened), also worried if it might weaken her hair follicles? I told her if she keeps scratching she’ll become bald. The Left Brain responds: Taya’s question prompted an interesting discussion in our Forum where Lindygirl and SarahF, and Vanyel pointed out that itchy scalp can have multiple causes. Itchy scalp: causes and cures Frequent washing with hot water can strip oils from your skin which could be contributing to the dryness. Dandruff is another common cause of itching. And of course there could be other medical conditions like psoriasis. My first suggestion is to try an anti-dandruff shampoo like Head & Shoulders, Selsun Blue, or Nizoral. The active ingredients in these products will reduce itchiness if indeed dandruff is the cause. She should specifically avoid using deep cleansing shampoos like you described – these are likely to only make the problem worse because they are “stronger” cleansers and can strip additional oils from the scalp. Reducing shampoo frequency may also be helpful. She might benefit using a dry shampoo on the days that she skips washing. (And if that doesn’t work she can always try rubbing whipping cream in her hair, as the Curly Girl Handbook suggests…) If these steps don’t help, she should probably check with a dermatologist to rule out other skin conditions.","How to cure itchy scalp","c6d6fd2e3954f3c3ee19cc5fb9946685970cd234","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2010/07/how-to-cure-itchy-scalp/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Why does wearing polish turn my nails yellow? by The Beauty Brains Sue Says: I was wondering why does wearing nail polish turn your nails yellow? Also, is there anything we can do to prevent that? The Right Brain Polishes Off This Response: Nail polish can turn your nails yellow. Why? There are a couple of reasons: Color reaction Some of the darker colored polishes can stain nails due to a chemical reaction between the colorant and the nail plate. This reaction is hard to predict because it doesn’t happen for everybody for every dark color. It can also take a few days to a few weeks to occur. Formaldehyde It’s also possible that formaldehyde (one of the ingredients in many nail polishes) is causing the problem. This chemical can react with the keratin protein in your nails and make it brittle and yellow. Medical issues Finally, if your nails are really yellowed and disfigured, you may have a nail infection or a more serious medical condition known as Yellow Nail Syndrome . So what can you do about it? Read on! Tips for non-yellowing nails: Don’t try to scrape off the stained area because it will damage and weaken the nail. Stay away from dark colors (which will greatly reduce your fashion options) Wear a base coat to protect your nails from staining (this makes sense to us) Look for nail polishes that don’t have formaldehyde on the ingredient list. (There’s no guartentee that this will work but hey, it beats this next tip we found from one of the nail polish companies from which is… Wear gloves (now there’s a practical idea!) Stop wearing polish and wait for your nails to grow out. (Also not too practical, this could take 4 to 6 months.) Soak your nails in 1/2 cup of water and juice of one lemon for up to 15 minutes, once a week, according to Sally Hanson. (We’re skeptical if this works but you can always add some sugar and just drink it as lemonade.) Buy only yellow shades of polish so you can’t tell if your nails are stained or not. (Sorry, just kidding on that one.) The Beauty Brains bottom Line: Nail polish can stain your nails yellow but by choosing the right shades, using a protective base coat, and drinking a lot of lemonade while wearing gloves, you should be able to control the problem.","Why does wearing polish turn my nails yellow?","ef1f47b8b00576c9945cf74b61b0c77fc6dee528","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2006/08/why-does-wearing-polish-turn-my-nails-yellow/"

And as everyone around you is getting more and more plastic/perfect every day, it’s hard not to start to hate your body. If you aren’t that into laying on the table as someone cuts into your face, try a Nose Up Beauty Clip – according to InventorSpot , they cause little pain but a bit of discomfort. They use pressure to raise and shape your nose, and you can wear them anywhere. In addition, there’s the Nose Up Bridge Straightener, which straightens the bridge of your nose.

"The Beauty Brains","","Do home microdermabrasion kits work? by The Beauty Brains Liz’s abrasive question: Tell me about those drug store microdermabrasion kits, such as the the Neutrogena Advanced Solutions At Home MicroDermabrasion System. Do they really work? Are they effective for reducing the appearance of small, minor scars from acne and the texture of skin overall? How is microdermbrasion different from regular exfoliating? The Right Brain’s Micro-Reply: The American Academy of Plastic Surgeons define microdermabrasion thusly: Microdermabrasion is a skin-freshening technique that helps repair facial skin that takes a beating from the sun and the effects of aging. The plastic surgeon uses a device like a fine sandblaster to spray tiny crystals across the face, mixing gentle abrasion with suction to remove the dead, outer layer of skin. As with other skin rejuvenation techniques, more than one treatment may be needed to reduce or remove fine wrinkles and unwanted pigmentation. (You can go here if you want to read more about “real” microdermabrasion ) So what does all this mean? Well, basically, there are no hard and fast legal or scientific definitions to work with here. So, any product or process that exfolliates the skin with tiny particles can really call itself microdermabrasion. (micro = tiny, derm = skin and abrasion = scraping the heck out of the upper layers of the skin to increase cell turnover and expose fresher layers beneath.) Even a spa bath can exfolliate. If you’re serious about the abrasion part of the equation, then we’d recommend hooking up with a dermatologist and get the real thing. Here’s an excellent article that indicates that when done properly, microdermabrasion can reduce fine lines and wrinkles and superficial scars. But if all you want is a quick beauty-in-a-bottle fix, there’s nothing wrong with trying the over the counter stuff. Products like Neutrogena At Home Microdermabrasion use aluminum oxide crystals, the same type of abrasive particles used in professional treatments and will exfoliate your skin. Of course so will a tube of St. Ives Apricot Scrub . The former will cost you about $35.00 and the latter is only $3.00. The Brains Bottom Line: Do the home microdermabrasion kits work? Well, they’ll certainly exfolliate and there’s no harm in giving them a shot. But if you’re serious about stripping away significant layers of your skin, you’d be better of considering professional treatment. Besides, if do it yourself and you screw up, you don’t have anyone to sue!","Do home microdermabrasion kits work?","ba80a6766e604f133da33a08d0d2f880087b9739","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2006/08/do-home-microdermabrasion-kits-work/"

"The Beauty Brains","","Dabur parachute and how do I oil my hair? by The Beauty Brains Nancy Needs To Know: You guys helped me so much with your Ojon review . I had recently purchased the Discovery Kit, which I liked, but not as much as I like the coconut oil ! I bought 2 bottles by Parachute, one plain coconut oil, and one named Sampoorna, which also contains almonds and hibiscus. I also bought a shampoo called Vatika Henna Creme Conditioning Shampoo by Dabur, which I would swear is Herbel Essence from the 70′s. I like them all, and was wondering if you could tell me what you thought of them and if you know the proper way to ‘oil’ my hair. I’m hoping this will keep more of my hair on my head! The Right Brain Responds To Another Loyal Beauty Brainiac: Thanks for the follow up question, Nancy. Parachute Sampoorna is an Indian product made by Marico Industries. As we discussed before, coconut oil has been scientifically proven to penetrate hair and therefore it can protect from the inside out. Almond oil and Hibiscus have not been shown to have this penetration ability, but it’s likely the almond oil could provide some surface conditioning, especially if the product is left in the hair and not rinsed out. We had a hard time finding out much more about Sampoorna, but if you copy the ingredient list for us or direct us to any website references you have (we couldn’t find much) we’ll get back to you. Dabur Vatika Henna Cream Shampoo appears to be a decent conditioning shampoo (it contains a quaternized quar and polyquat-7, both pretty good ingredients for delivering conditioning from a shampoo) but don’t get fooled by it’s hype. Here’s what it says: A unique double action formula enriched with natural conditioners to nourish, condition and clean your hair gently. Henna prevents the growth of micro-organisms, gives body and also a superb shine to your hair. Green Almonds nourish hair from the roots while bringing new life. Soap Fruit (Shikakai) is a mild natural cleanser with low pH balance that’s just right for your hair. Does this shampoo use natural ingredients that are better than “regular” shampoos. Nope. If you read their entire website, Dabur tells you that the formula also contains Sodium lauryl ether sulfate which is a very standard cleansing/foaming agent. So the reference to to “Soap Fruit” is really just a bunch of bull-shikakai. Furthermore, if you need henna in your shampoo to get rid of “micro-organisms” you’ve got significant hygiene issues – go buy a lice shampoo!

"The Beauty Brains","","Pale is the new tan by The Beauty Brains Being pale has long been a curse in the US, in the age of tanning beds, fake tans, and California babes. We look at redheads with pity; freckles are terrible bothers; skin whiter than it is dark is shameful; and tan lines should be nonexistent, or else. Once summer ends, you look around and find people whose tans have yet to fade, and somehow, they bring back that beautiful whiff of summer – reminders of the crickets chirping late at night, the long, warm, lazy afternoons by the pool, and that fantastic vacation you went on in July. But somehow, you never seem to tan – you always turn red as a ripe tomato and start to peel. Well, according to ScienceDaily , that will change. Tans are caused by a pigment called melanin in your skin, which protects you from UV rays. New research has come out saying that, while scientists once thought that the reason some people burn is because they have no melanin, this has now been proven false. When isolated, melanin from pale skin was able to make as much of, if not more than, the pigment than that of olive skin. The only problem was that fair skin also seemed to make more of the chemical that causes sunburn. The article says that there must be something else blocking pale-skinned people from getting tan, and that further research will attempt to make this clear. Next time you stare at your freckles in disgust, think that one day, your face may be tan as the rest of America’s. And in the mean time, always protect yourself from skin cancer – maybe pale skin will come back into fashion!","Pale is the new tan","ccf1bacbf65d99f39d3d06e8a5f901528d9a6d3d","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2010/08/pale-is-the-new-tan/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Does silicone dry out your hair? by The Beauty Brains Summer Says About Silicones: What a treat your blog is! I can’t get enough. I am an esthetician and an absolute ingredient crazy beauty product junkie. My question for you is whether or not silicone in any of its forms is drying and therefore damaging to the hair. My hair stylist told me that it dries hair out, resulting in the breakage I have always experienced. As a curly haired woman living in humidity, silicones have saved me from much unneccessary frizz. Please clarify what effect silicones have on hair, and also skin if you could, as I was taught that they formed a protective layer over the skin holding in the skin’s natural moisture (as well as imparting a silky feel to the surface). THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR SERVICE! The Right Brain’s Silky Smooth Reply: Good for your Summer! You’re not blindly following the advice of your hair stylist! The truth is, silicone (the molecule pictured above) is one of the MOST effective ingredients for conditioning hair or skin. In both cases it serves as a protective barrier. In fact, in skin lotions dimethicone (a form of silicone) is so good it’s approved as an over the counter drug ingredient. In hair care products you’ll see a mixture of dimethicone and cyclomethicone typically used. Again, dimethicone is heavier and coats the hair; cyclomethicone is very thin and helps to spread the dimethicone, it also evaporates so it’s good for use in lightweight products like leave in conditioners or volumizing products. The Brains ‘ Bottom Line: Silicones are good moisturizers for hair and skin and are commonly used in many, many products. We’ve never seen any data that shows they dry out or damage hair.","Does silicone dry out your hair?","6b61d2845d6cd05b2a648b4986afac697310be44","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2006/08/does-silicone-dry-out-your-hair/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Does Beauty Depend on Where You Live? by The Beauty Brains Attractiveness has long been an important part of society. The general feeling is, if you’re beautiful, you have a higher ability to be happy. But according to ScienceDaily and researchers from the University of Georgia and the University of Kansas, being attractive matters more depending on your geographical location. If you live in an urban area, the study suggests, you have a higher pressure to be attractive. In fact, women in these areas generally think that attractive people are more psychologically well than those who are unattractive. Beauty matters in socially mobile places more because you have your pick of friends and social activities, and associating with beautiful people is usually the choice made. However, in rural areas, there isn’t so much variety. You’re going to socialize with people in the community if you live in a place where there aren’t a lot of people, and you aren’t going to be choosy. Perhaps more importantly, beauty will not ensure happiness. Even pretty urban women are at risk for psychological unrest. So rather than worrying about your looks go out and have a good time with your friends, wherever you live.","Does Beauty Depend on Where You Live?","7add5be3878d225d16c58a086c7c46e430f82108","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2010/08/does-beauty-depend-on-where-you-live/"
"The Beauty Brains","","How does intimate shaving work? (sensitive content alert) by The Beauty Brains N asks: I’ve always wanted to experiment with intimate shaving but I’m a bit nervous. I don’t really trust the info from some of the “naughtier” websites, so I thought I’d ask your scientific perspective: Is there any safe and easy way to style pubic hair? The Right Brain’s Response: Don’t worry, N, with The Beauty Brains discretion is always assured. There are really two parts to our answer. First, we’ll talk about the right shaving products; then we’ll tell you how to get the stylish look you want. 1) Shaving Products : This is actually the easy part. While there are a number of speciality shave products for initmate areas, there’s nothing wrong with using the brand that you typically use on your legs. If you find that your skin is generally sensitive to fragrance you might want to buy a fragrance free cream or lotion. Or, if you want to splurge and try something new, you might try shopping at Tabutoys.com where there’s a wide array of sexy products to choose from. And if you’re worried about irritation after shaving you might check out their “ Coochy After Shave Protection Mist .” What about the razor? A regular blade razor is fine for most women but if you’re prone to razor bumps you can buy razors specially designed for sensitive areas. The Bodworx Shaver and The CleanCu t are a couple of examples you might check out. 2) The Style: Here’s where it gets tricky. A little sexy snipping can be a good thing but the task can be a bit daunting if you’ve never attempted it before. We found a good article an Erotic University that gives some very helpful tips. The article has some very explicit pictures, so we’re copying the text here so you can read what they have to say without being offended. Here are some key points from the article: There are a number of methods you can use to remove hair. Waxing and sugaring are both applied to strips that are yanked off. I’ll pass, thank you. Depilatories work well for some, but can be irritating to sensitive skin, and skin does not get a lot more sensitive than in the genital region. For most, old fashioned shaving is the best bet. Razors are not all alike, though. You’ll want to use a good one rather than one of the cheap throwaway models. One commonly recommended is the Gillette GII, as it is reported that they stay sharp much longer. You can use any kind of shaving foam, but different brands can contain various chemicals and deodorants that can and often do cause skin rashes and itchiness. That is why we recommend a shaving lubricant designed specifically for shaving the nether regions. The first step is to trim as much hair as you can with a pair of scissors or clippers, as this will prevent the razor clogging up too much. Then take a hot bath or shower for ten minutes to expand your pores and follicles and soften the hair. Apply plenty of shaving lubricant and leave it on for a few minutes. This will allow the hairs to soften further. Begin shaving upwards, towards your torso. Hair normally grows downwards, and shaving against the grain will give you a smoother finish. Make sure that there is shaving lubricant on each section of skin that you shave, as shaving bare skin will irritate it. Keep rinsing the shaver every couples of swipes or so, so that it does not get clogged. The labia is a little more complicated to shave. Stretch the skin out flat, and shave towards your inner thigh. Take your time with this. For men’s testicles, stretch the skin out and shave towards the inner thigh. When all the hair has been removed wash the area gently with cool water. Hot water can cause irritation. Gently pat dry, and then apply some skin moisturizer or baby lotion. If you want to read the entire article you can click on this link but be aware it does contain some explicit (NSFW) images! So please use caution if you choose to view it. When you’ve mastered the basics of trimming and you’re ready to try for a “special” look – check this out. It’s the pubic hair styling equivalent of training wheels: the Sazzi Shaper. This handy little device helps you shave exactly the pattern you want . You put on the Sazzi Shaper just like you would wear a thong. Then you wax, wet shave or dry shave around it, using the Shaper as a template. When you’re done, you’ve got perfectly pictured pubes. You can see some of the pubic hair style design templates here. They only have a few designs now, but with a little imagination, the sky’s the limit on a product like this. Oh, one more thing. If you prefer to do your trimming old school style, here’s a tongue-in -cheek description of various pubic hair styles.

According to ScientificAmerican.com some natural concoctions really do work while others are not only unsuccessful, but actually potentially harmful.

But there are some less likely ones – lemons, for example, are filled with acids that help with wrinkles and acne. Also, eating foods rich in oil (omega-3) will help your skin.

"The Beauty Brains","None","What’s the difference between rinse-out and leave-in conditioner? by The Beauty Brains Mari Murmers: Hi Beauty Brains, Thanks for all the info, its really fantastic! What the difference is between regular conditioner and leave-in conditioner? I’ve been putting a little bit of conditioner on after I’ve toweled off my hair and all (except Pantene) seem to work better that way for my curly hair. The Right’s Really Righteous Reply: If you’re asking if it’s ok to use little bit of rinse out conditioner and leave it in your hair, the answer is yes as long as it leaves your hair looking and feeling the way you want. Rinse out conditioners are typically made with heavier ingredients (and they generally conditioner better) because they contain a combination of “fatty” chemicals and high molecular weight silicones. You don’t usually find these ingredients in leave in conditioners because they weigh the hair down too much. Now, if you have hair that’s really thirsty for conditioning, all bets are off. And while most leave ins don’t make very good rinse out products (because they’re not designed to stay on the hair after rinsing), many rinse outs could work well as a leave in. Two things to watch out for: 1) Make sure you only apply to the ends of your hair and don’t use too much or your hair will get greasy. 2) If you have sensitive skin, the ingredients and fragrance used in the rinse out product MAY cause irritation if left on too long. If you experience irritation, stop using the product entirely! The Brain ‘s Bottom Line: Rinse out and Leave in products are formulated to have different functionality, but they can overlap. If it makes your hair happy, feel free to leave in a rinse out.","What’s the difference between rinse-out and leave-in conditioner?","101f9ef28638f941f1872e23db2bc6a46a210aa8","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2006/08/whats-the-difference-between-rinse-out-and-leave-in-conditioner/"
"The Beauty Brains","","5 ways to reduce enlarged pores by The Beauty Brains Jess just wants to know… I have had large pores for as long as I remember. What products really work to shrink facial pores? The Right Brain’s reply: Unfortunately, none. At first glance, you may think that pore control products offer to make your pores smaller, but if you read the label carefully you’ll see that in most cases they just claim to reduce the appearance of large pores. That may sound like a subtle distinction but it’s really not. There’s not much you can do to physically make your pores smaller but you can avoid making them look larger. Instead of looking for “shrinking” products, try avoiding these 5 factors that can make pores look plump: 1. Skin debris … …like dead skin cells can collect in pores making them appear bigger. Good facial cleansing is key to staying debris-free. 2. Excessive oiliness … …can keep pores filled with a layer of oil that accentuates their appearance. Consider using oil-absorbing makeup or more frequent cleansing or blotting. 3. Bacterial growth… …contribute to blackheads and make pores appear freakishly huge. Exfolliation can help. 4. Sun exposure… … can thicken the skin cells around the edge of pores making them appear larger. Using a sunscreen or limiting your sun exposure is a good idea. 5. Genetics … …determines your skin type and if you’re unlucky enough to be born with oily, thicker skin your pores will probably be more noticeable.

For everyone else to see, here’s how Sarah laid out the problem: Sarah’s Suppositions White Rain ingredients Water, cetyl alcohol, dicetyldimonium chloride, sorbitol, phenosyethanol, stearyl alcohol, stearamidopropyl dimethylamine, ceteareth-20, behenyl alcohol, fragrance, citric acid (Not many ingredients but they all sound familiar after reading your site for awhile.) All Soft ingredients Water (Aqua), Behenalkonium Chloride, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Propylene Glycol Ceteth-3 Acetate, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cetyl Alcohol, PEG 100 Stearate, Glyceryl Stearate, Fragrance, Phenoxyethanol, Cetrimonium Chloride, Dimethicone, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, PPG-5 Ceteth-10, Methylparaben, Ethylparaben, Propylparaben, Disodium EDTA, Taurine, Oleth 10, Disodium Cocamidoproprionate, Lecithin, Phosphoric Acid, Wheat Amino Acids, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Avocado/Persea Gratissima, Hydroxypropyl Trimonium Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Trehalose, Arginine HCI, Orange No. 4 (CI 15510), Yellow 5 (CI 19140) So the marketing folk at Redken say that Avocado Oil = softness & moisture; Proteins = help strengthen; and Amino Acids = deep conditioning. But I say, looking at the ingredients, it’s got to be the glycerin. Avocado and proteins are pretty far down the list, and glycerin doesn’t show up in other conditioners, not even in most of Redken’s own other formulas (and nowhere near as high in the ingredient list). Glycerin is moisturizing, So my question is, a) am I right? Is it glycerin that makes my hair rock? If so, then b) what is it doing to rock so hard? And c) how likely am I to find cheaper brands that have it in the first five ingredients? The real deal Now, let us help you understand even better by dissecting the ingredients in Redken one by one. Water – the solvent that acts as the carrier for all the other ingredients. Behenalkonium Chloride – a long chain fatty conditioning agent, good for classic conditioning and moisturization. Glycerin – not really functional in rinse off conditoners because it rinses down the drain. (So sorry, but you were wrong about that part!) Cetearyl Alcohol – a thickener/emulsifier that is really a blend of cetyl alcohol and stearyl alcohol. Propylene Glycol Ceteth-3 Acetate – an emulsifier. Cyclopentasiloxane – a type of silicone used as a light conditioner and spreading agent. Cetyl Alcohol – thickener/emulsifier. PEG 100 Stearate, Glyceryl Stearate – more emulsifiers Fragrance – mmmm, smells soft. Cetrimonium Chloride – an inexpensive traditional conditioner. Works well with the Behenalkonium chloride. Dimethicone – a type of high molecular weight silicone that gives a protective layer on hair. Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride – good, mild conditioner made from guar beans. PPG-5 Ceteth-10 – yet another emuslifier. Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Ethylparaben, Propylparaben, Disodium EDTA – preservatives Disodium Cocamidoproprionate – a surfactant that helps disperse the other stuff in the formula. Taurine, Oleth 10, Lecithin, Wheat Amino Acids, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Avocado/Persea Gratissima, Hydroxypropyl Trimonium Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Trehalose, Arginine HCI, – basically featured ingredients that don’t add much, if any, efficacy to the product. Interestingly, Trehalose is a wood fiber that supposedly can replace silicone as a conditioning agent. We’ve tried to make formulations with it and could never get it do to a damn thing! Phosphoric Acid- controls the pH. Orange No. 4 (CI 15510), Yellow 5 (CI 19140) – colorants. Alright, there you have a complete analysis of what each ingredient in the formula does. Rock and/or roll Which one makes the formula “rock,” as you so eloquently put it? Well, it’s certainly NOT the glycerin, that pretty much rinses off. It’s also not the avocado oil or other ingredients that Redken mentioned. It’s really the multiple conditioners in the formula, but if we had to pick one or two, we’d say it’s the combination of the Behenalkonium Chloride and the Cyclopentasiloxane. Would anyone else like to try to dissect one of your favorite products? Give it a shot and send your thoughts to the Beauty Brains and we’ll review it for you.","What Makes Redken All Soft Conditioner Rock?","5873a9ba728f0a8694b9ae58c8ca51931e3f7359","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2010/10/what-makes-redken-all-soft-conditioner-rock-2/"
"The Beauty Brains","2016-01-20 05:00:00","Beauty Q&A: what’s the best way to remove facial hair? by The Beauty Brains Sad Says: Hi.. A few months ago I noticed some stray hairs on my chin and upper lip.. I impulsively shaved them off!!! *BAD ME, I know* Now I find that I need to *ahem* shave every 2-3 days sometimes.. I try to let it go as long as I can so I don’t shave too much.. My real question is, what is the BEST way to remove facial hair on SENSITIVE skin? I’ve used depilatory creams.. And they were no help.. Thank you! (I am a female by the way ha ha.) The Right Brain’s Hairy Reply: Sad, let’s clear start by clearing up a popular myth: shaving hair does not make it grow more. So you didn’t make matters worse by shaving to get rid of those stray hairs. But now that you’ve got them, what can you do? Believe it or not, a trip to your doctor’s office might be your best solution. There’s a new prescription medication that’s been clinically proven to reduce unwanted facial hair, or UFH as they refer to it. (God, we LOVE scientific acronyms!) It’s called Vaniqua and it’s designed to slow the growth of facial hair on women. It doesn’t get rid of hair, you still have to shave or whatever, but Vaniqua reduces the time you have to spend on hair removal. Go read the drug’s FAQs if you’re interested. We here at The Beauty Brains are intrigued by the idea of an Anti-Shave Drug – what will they think of next?? Can they make it work on other parts of the body? Can they make a version for men so they can stop shaving? The mind reels at the possibilities. Once again, better living through chemistry. Of course, if drug treatment isn’t for you – there are still the old school methods of hair removal : tweezing, depilatories, etc. You’ll have to experiment and find out which one is best for your sensitive skin.","Beauty Q&A: what’s the best way to remove facial hair?","a0984c24668b9464a8fb3dbbf0b6d1c797a23933","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2006/07/beauty-qa-whats-the-best-way-to-remove-facial-hair/"
"The Beauty Brains","","5 ways to reduce enlarged pores by The Beauty Brains Jess just wants to know… I have had large pores for as long as I remember. What products really work to shrink facial pores? The Right Brain’s reply: Unfortunately, none. At first glance, you may think that pore control products offer to make your pores smaller, but if you read the label carefully you’ll see that in most cases they just claim to reduce the appearance of large pores. That may sound like a subtle distinction but it’s really not. There’s not much you can do to physically make your pores smaller but you can avoid making them look larger. Instead of looking for “shrinking” products, try avoiding these 5 factors that can make pores look plump: 1. Skin debris … …like dead skin cells can collect in pores making them appear bigger. Good facial cleansing is key to staying debris-free. 2. Excessive oiliness … …can keep pores filled with a layer of oil that accentuates their appearance. Consider using oil-absorbing makeup or more frequent cleansing or blotting. 3. Bacterial growth… …contribute to blackheads and make pores appear freakishly huge. Exfolliation can help. 4. Sun exposure… … can thicken the skin cells around the edge of pores making them appear larger. Using a sunscreen or limiting your sun exposure is a good idea. 5. Genetics … …determines your skin type and if you`re unlucky enough to be born with oily, thicker skin your pores will probably be more noticeable. Changing your parents could help this but is probably not a very practical solution.","5 ways to reduce enlarged pores","5c957ce731753b894d2bd275c78592342f5e92f8","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2010/11/5-ways-to-reduce-enlarged-pores-2/"
"Perry Romanowski","","Are Arbonne products the best skin care you can buy by Perry Romanowski Wenditha wonders: So I’m wondering about a beauty company called Arbonne? Could you tell me what the Beauty Brains think? They’re supposed to be the end-all, be-all, but I remain cautious. However, I’ve used some samples of their anti-aging skin line and found it to be very nice. The Beauty Brains respond: Thanks for the question. We looked into the Arbonne products and have this to say. The Arbonne Company First, Arbonne is one of these multi-level marketing companies like Amway in which you are encouraged to become a salesperson, have parties and recruit other people to become salespeople. I’ve always been skeptical of these kinds of schemes but here’s a guy who has an interesting perspective on Arbonne on becoming an Arbonne salesperson. Personally, I wonder why the products aren’t sold in the normal way through department or grocery stores. This would certainly make it easy to ignore the truth in advertising rules that other companies who sell through stores need to follow. The Arbonne Marketing Story Based on the information on their website, Arbonne products are claimed to be premium skin care products are formulated in Switzerland at the Arbonne Institute of Research and Development (AIRD) and made in the U.S.A. They follow the standard all-natural marketing story that you find from every other natural company, although they imply some kind of advanced science as if there was any. All the usual claims about how great their products are here. We’ve previously discussed cosmetic claims and what they really mean. Here is a sampling of their claims. Botanically based: based on botanical and herbal principles. This doesn’t really mean anything. What are botanical & herbal principles? pH correct. Big deal. So is every other skin care product. Dermatologist tested. Just like everyone else`s product. Formulated without dyes, animal products, fragrances, mineral oil. Again, more stuff that everyone else says. The thing that’s different about these products than a mass market brand like Aveeno is the price. Arbonne is a whopping $19.50 for 8 ounces! Aveeno is $9.99 for 18 ounces. Functionally, there will likely be no noticeable difference. The Arbonne Products The problem with these products is that they don’t live up to their natural claims. While we here at The Beauty Brains think stories about the trouble with chemicals like SLS and parabens are overblown, the natural crowd does not feel similarly. Arbonne formulas fail in this regard because they contain all kinds of chemicals that those people are afraid of. This review of Arbonne products spells it all out from their perspective. Of course, this fact has no bearing on whether the products are good or not, but it certainly suggests their marketing is suspect. So, what about the products? Are they worth the extra money? Scientifically speaking, they’re probably not. It was difficult to find the ingredient lists because they are not on their main website. However, here is one we found related to their skin lotion. Arbonne Skin Moisturizing Lotion Ingredients: Water, Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG-100 Stearate, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Glycerin, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter) Fruit, Althaea Officinalis Root Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Extract, Taraxacum Officinale (Dandelion) Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Salvia Officinalis (Sage) Leaf Extract, Retinyl Palmitate, Ergocalciferol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Panthenol, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Zea Mays (Corn) Oil, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil, Rosa Damascena Flower Oil, Stearic Acid, Cetyl Alcohol, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Polysorbate 60, Carbomer, Disodium EDTA, Dimethicone, Quaternium-15, Triethanolamine This is a standard lotion complete with water, fatty alcohols, oils, emulsifiers, thickeners and preservatives. All of the natural sounding ingredients are most likely in there at such low levels they don’t really do anything. And even if they were in there at higher levels there is no proof that they would have any special effect anyway. The Beauty Brains bottom line Arbonne is not the end-all be all of skin care or any other personal care product. They are good formulas, but pretty standard and will not perform noticeably better than the products you can buy at your local grocery store. Buy them if you like (they’ll work fine) but don’t kid yourself into thinking they are anything special, they’re not. And if you’re looking to start your own business, forget multi-level marketing schemes.","Are Arbonne products the best skin care you can buy","d77c2499c8c7d71523b1a44d06fd07e47b3eb4bf","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2006/07/are-arbonne-products-the-best-skin-care-you-can-buy/"
"The Beauty Brains","","How to Get Rid of Razor Bumps and Ingrown Hairs by The Beauty Brains Jincy wants the juice… I am dealing with a frequent problem of having ingrown hair after waxing my legs, arms and even my underarms. I don’t know what to do about it. I have tried using a scrubber, moisturizing cream to remove it, but this is just getting worse every time I wax. Now, my legs are looking terrible due to these skin problems, could you help? The Right Brain Responds: While we’re not doctors, we do watch a lot of medical TV shows so we feel well qualified to answer your question. Follicle folly Seriously, it sounds like you have a case of folliculitis – a condition in which the hair follicle becomes inflamed and irritated. This condition occurs a lot with men when they shave their face. It can also occur on other parts of the body, like the legs. If you click the link you can read more about this condition but if you do, please scroll down past the pictures of buttock folliculitis very fast. You’ll be glad you did. The best treatment is to let your leg hairs grow out to give your follicles a chance to recover. And we recommend picking up a couple of pints of Ben and Jerry’s Chunky Monkey and renting Season 1 of Grey’s Anatomy since you won’t be going out in public much. Just kidding. Really, you should get Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough. But all joking about ice cream and lack of social contact aside, you do need to give your follicles a rest. If you HAVE to do something, shave instead of waxing for a while. That’s less irritating to the follicle. Do YOU have any problems with ingrown hairs and irritated follicles?

"The Beauty Brains","","Beauty q&a: is oil good for your hair? by The Beauty Brains Anon E. Moose Asks: I’ve heard that applying oils like jojoba oil, almond oil and coconut oil is good for your hair. I’ve been thinking about using it, so I want to know, is it true that almond oil is good for your hair? The Right Brain’s Oily Reply : The answer to your question depends on which oil you’re talking about. In a previous post we discussed a research study that showed some natural oils not only penetrate hair but actually help restore hair’s strength and flexibility. Coconut oil as found in Ojon treatments was shown to be the best, followed by sunflower oil. None of the other oils did very much because they did not penetrate hair. The Beauty Brain’s Bottom Line If you do decide to treat your hair to an oil treatment, coconut oil is the best choice scientifically speaking. Just make sure you’re using pure coconut oil and not a watered down product.","Beauty q&a: is oil good for your hair?","e9e383077e5b7014c42cdc2340f6a71943922cf8","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2006/07/beauty-qa-is-oil-good-for-your-hair/"
"The Beauty Brains","","What’s the best foundation for acne-prone skin? by The Beauty Brains Jessica is acne prone… I want to buy a foundation primer, and the ones that I find are silicone based. Is silicone bad for acne prone/oily skin? The Right Brain Is Answer Prone: There are four basic types of foundation formulations: Oil-based for dry skin; water-based products for all skin types; oil-free for oily skin; and anhydrous for extremely long wearing. Foundation fundamentals According to one of our favorite dermatologists , Dr. Zoe Draelos, silicone foundations are preferred for oily skin. That’s because silicone is non-comedogenic which means it won’t clog your pores. So go for it! Interesting Bonus Fact: Unlike animal, vegetable or mineral oils, silicones are not based on carbon.

"The Beauty Brains","2014-12-10 17:53:00","Beauty Buzz: The Great Eyeliner Hunt – How Does Eyeliner Work? by The Beauty Brains The authors of some of the other beauty blogs have asked us to explain how eyeliner works. So here’s how ‘liners make you lovely! Types of Eyeliners Eyeliners are formulated into two basic types: pencils and liquids. While the details vary, both types use these same basic ingredients. Basic Ingredients The Base is the backbone of the formula. In the case of pencils, its the waxy/greasy matrix that forms the core of the pencil; in the liquids its the water/oil emulsion in which the rest of the ingredients are suspended. Typical base ingredients include waxes and oils, emollients (spreading agents) and in the case of liquid type, water and emulsifiers. Colors Colorants used in eyeliners (and other cosmetics used around the eye) must be approved by the FDA (in the United States). Colorants that can be used in products for other parts of the body aren’t necessarily safe enough to be used around your eyes. Typical colorants include iron oxides and ultramarine pigments. Carmine is another colorant you see from time to time. It’s a red color made from crushed insect bodies. Mmmmm! Control agents These are added to eyeliner formulations to make sure the product meets specifications when it’s manufactured and that it maintains high quality afer manufacture. These include chemicals that control the pH, or acid/base balance of the product, and that keep the product free of bacteria and mold. In some oil based formulas, an antioxidant may be added to keep the waxes and oils from going rancid. Typical control agents include tocopherol (also known as vitamin E) used for its antioxidant properties as well as Citric Acid, Methylparaben, and Propylparaben. Featured ingredients Several things can be added to eyeliners to make them more appealing to consumers. These ingredients don’t change the way the product works or the way it looks, but marketers add them because women think they are helpful. For some reason aloe vera is a very typical featured ingredient. Now you know, what next? There are two ways that understanding eyeliner ingredients could be helpful. Let’s say your favorite eyeliner is being discontinued. If you know what kind of base ingredients to look for, you might be able to pick a replacement without having to try so many new products. On the flip side, if you’re getting irritation or an allergic reaction to your eyeliner, you might be able to figure out what ingredients to stay away from when you shop for a new one. Now, if you’re really into this, you can practice reading ingredient lists with the following examples of popular brands. Or you just scroll to the end: Maybelline Line Stylist Eyeliner (Automatic pencil type) Base: Isododecane, Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone, Cera Alba/Beeswax, Carnauba/Carnabua Wax, Trimethylsiloxysilicate, Hydrogenated Palm Kernel Glycerides, Isoeicosane, Hydrogenated Palm Glycerides, Isopropyl Palmitate Silica, Calcium Aluminum Borosilicate, Colorants: Titanium Dioxide, Chromium Oxide Greens, Manganese Violet, Bismuth Oxychloride, Chromium Hydroxide Green, Ferric Ferrocyanide, and Carmine Control agents (pH, preservatives): Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Ethylparaben, Tocopherol Featured ingredients: Retinyl Palmitate, Aloe Barbadensis Extract, Revlon Colorstay Eyeliner (Pencil type) Base: Cyclomethicone, Trimethysiloxysilicate, Ozokerite, Polyethylene, Phenyl Trimethicone, Euphorbia Cerifera Wax (Candelilla), Lecithin, Colorants: Iron Oxides, Titanium Dioxide, Mica, Ultramarines, Chromium Oxide Greens, Ferric Ferrocyanide, Bronze Powder, Carmine, Chromium Hydroxide Green, Copper Powder, Manganese Violet, Ferric Ammonium Ferrocyanide Control agents (pH, preservatives): Sorbic Acid, Citric Acid, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Tocopherol Featured ingredients: Ascorbyl Palmitate Maxfactor Linemaker waterproof eyeliner (brush applied liquid) Base: Water, Butylene Glycol, Alcohol, Oleic Acid, Dioctyl Sodium Sulfosuccinate, Oleth 20, Bentonite Colorants: Iron Oxides, Carmine Control agents (pH, preservatives): Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Ethylparaben, Propylparaben, Butylparaben, BHA, Quaternium-15, , Sodium Bicarbonate, Featured ingredients: None Burts’ Bees Two in One Eye Brow and Eyeliner Pencil (Pencil type) Base: Sunflower Oil, Coconut Oil, Japan Wax (vegetable wax), Carnauba Wax, Zinc Oxide, Beeswax, Colorants: May Contain: Titanium Dioxide, Iron Oxide, Mica Control agents (pH, preservatives): Tocopheryl Acetate Featured ingredients: None.

"The Beauty Brains","2015-09-14 07:21:00","The 3 biggest lies cosmetic companies tell you by The Beauty Brains Kris’ question… I’m testing out Arbonne right now, but am thinking I can’t afford it. My mother-in-law is a “beauty consultant” for BeautiControl and they seem to have a pretty extensive line of skin care products. Do you know anything about the quality of their line (I’m looking mainly at cleansers, toners, anti-aging products and moisturizers) and/or can you recommend any of their products? The Left Brain Lashes Out: I’m surprised anyone can afford Arbonne ! Just kidding. Based on what I’ve seen, the Beauticontrol products seem to be of reasonable quality. They’re also very pricey, but if you afford them, that’s your decision. What bugs me, and the reason that I would not recommend them, is the way the company hypes their products. I understand the need for creative marketing, but when a company makes statements that border on untrue, that disturbs me. I just hate being lied to and I REALLY hate being lied to under the guise of science. To me there’s at least 3 tip offs when a company is stretching the truth about their products. Let me give you some examples using Beauticontrol: Lie #1: Claims of Exclusivity What’s the lie – they tell that “only” their products can give you a certain benefit. What’s the truth – the truth is, unless they have a patent or a documented trade secret, they’re using the same technology as everyone else in the industry. What’s the example -Beauticontrol says “only BeautiControl offers comprehensive, customized skin care that addresses what your skin needs¦when it needs it.” Based on their product catalog they appear to have typical cleansers, toners, lotions, etc. that are offered by many, many other companies. Why do they say “only” Beauticontrol offers this kind of treatment? Lie #2: Implying Superior Performance without Substantiation What’s the lie – they tell you their product works better than anyone else’s. What’s the truth – if they make claims like that they’d better have some kind of proof. What’s the example – Beauticontrol says “Far beyond traditional dry, combination and oily skin care, BeautiControl takes an innovative, personal approach, to provide total skin wellness through.” Blah, blah blah. Again, with conventional products there is no way they can convince me that their products are far beyond traditional ones. Yes, they may be applying a different marketing spin, but there is no technology muscle behind their mouth. Lie #3: “Magic” Ingredient Claims What’s the lie – they say that some sexy sounding ingredient makes the product work. What’s the truth – in reality, most of the time it’s the formula as a whole and not any single ingredient that makes the product work. What’s the example – Beauticontrol says one of their products is “formulated with the rejuvenating minerals of the Dead Sea.” Minerals don’t rejuvenate skin, moisturizing agents do. Ok, now that I’ve gotten that out of my system, maybe Beauticontrol isn’t “lying” to us (I’m going to catch hell from the Right Brain for this post!) but they certainly are overstating the uniqueness of their line. And as a scientist, that kind of hype turns me off. For more about Arbonne products see this post.","The 3 biggest lies cosmetic companies tell you","c77a173a3d53116382443b3c09384edd43c79ddb","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2010/12/the-3-biggest-lies-cosmetic-companies-tell-you/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Does hair grow faster in the summer? by The Beauty Brains Hoconnor asks… I’ve always heard that hair grows faster in the summer. Is this true? Why? And if so, is there a way to recreate the summer benefit in the winter (such as with the addition of humidifiers, heat lamps, diet changes?) The Right Brain responds: We’ve said this before and we mean it: the members of the Beauty Brains Forum are awesome! After Hoconnor posted this question, SarahF and Lelaleia did some research and found several interesting references. Even though Left Brain admitted to being stumped on this one, these additional resources made us think. That’s the beauty of true science – we’re always glad to reconsider our positions when new data comes in. You can read the entire discussion in the original Forum post , but we’ll recap the highlights here. Summer time tresses 1. Seasonal Changes in Human Hair Growth “… The rate of growth of the beard was lowest in January and February and increased steadily from March to July to reach a peak about 60% above the winter level. The rate of growth of thigh hair showed a similar pattern though with less pronounced differences.” 2. Seasonal Variation in Trichogram in Chilean Subjects “During summer the percentage of telogen increases and the percentage of anagen decreases. This study confirms the presence of seasonal variations in normal trichogram.” 3. Seasonality of Hair Shedding in Healthy Women “These results confirm the findings of former authors who have indicated seasonal changes in human hair growth, though this is the first study performed systematically in a representative number of women.” It looks like there is reasonable evidence that hair grows faster in the summer. What an interesting and surprising finding! Isn’t science wonderful?","Does hair grow faster in the summer?","0f798a05e84784d842a843e2af535588e2c5a82e","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2010/12/does-hair-grow-faster-in-the-summer/"
"The Beauty Brains","","How To Tell if You Need a Facial by The Beauty Brains Cheong’s facing a facial… Do I really need to get a facial to get a perfect complexion or is just cleansing and moisturizing at home enough? If I do need facials, how often should I get them? The Right Brain replies: The first question is: why should you get a facial in the first place? What good does it really do? The answer depends on what kind of facial you get and who does it. Facial facts According to the American Academy of Dermatologists, facial rejuvenation can effectively reduce wrinkles, treat sun spots, tighten loose skin, improve skin tone and color, remove blotchiness, and eliminate damaged blood vessels. They discuss 9 types of facial treatments including the use of Topical Products; Fillers and Botox ; Chemical Peels; Dermabrasion and Microdermabrasion; Laser Resurfacing; Radiofrequency Technologies; Photodynamic Therapy; Surgical Excision; and Liposuction. If your complexion is really messed up, you may need one or more of these procedures to get it back in shape. Most of these procedures must be performed by a doctor but a beautician or aesthetician can help you with topical products, chemical peels, and dermabrasion. Depending on the condition of your skin, these treatments may need to be repeated for best results. There’s no way to know how many treatments you’ll need or how often you’ll need them without actually examining your skin. Beauty basics If your complexion just needs a touch up then you really only need basic facial care like cleansing, exfoliation, massage, and extraction of blackheads. If that’s all your skin needs, The Beauty Brains say that there’s no reason you can’t do that yourself at home.

"The Beauty Brains","","What you should know about treating ingrown hairs by The Beauty Brains Lydia’s got ingrown hair issues… After I wax my legs and hands, there is a relapse of ingrown hair on my waxed skin. It looks terrible and I have tried treating ,but nothing is working out. Does scrubbing help ? Or is there any remedy to cure this skin problem? The Right Brain recommends an anti-inflammatory: It sounds like you might have a case of folliculitis, a condition in which your hair follicle becomes inflamed. Waxing can irritate the hair follicle which causes dead cells to build up at the site of the irritation and form small pus containing pockets. This blockage can trap the hair as it tries to grow out of the follicle and poof! you’ve got an ingrown hair. Scrubbing will only make things worse so DON’T! In fact, you need to give your follicles a rest for a while until the inflammation dies down. While we’ve never tested them, we have heard good things about the Tendskin product and Paula’s Choice Skin Relief. They both use aspirin, an proven anti-inflammatory, to soothe your skin. If you have to remove more hair, shave instead of waxing because that’s less irritating to the follicle. (By the way, you can go here to see our original post on this subject and click through to see some really disturbing pictures of Follicles Gone Wild. But don’t say we didn’t warn you!)","What you should know about treating ingrown hairs","7fe33322274870d017a32810d1986ad4b5c466b8","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2011/02/what-you-should-know-about-treating-ingrown-hairs-2/"
"The Beauty Brains","None","Wrinkle Creams: How to tell which ones really work by The Beauty Brains Beautie15 asks… What is your go-to anti-aging/wrinkle product? I do some work with StriVectin and I love to hear feedback from anyone who has tried it or are thinking about trying it to help reduce the appearance of lines on your face. I’ve been trying the new StriVectin-SD for about 5 weeks now and my face feels softer and looks healthier. They say it takes about 8 weeks to see full results, so I’ll let you know how it goes! The Right Brain responds: To be honest, Beautie, we haven’t heard great things about StiVectin (see this discussion thread in our Forum for details.) But, we are big fans of testing products for yourself rather than just accepting the marketing hype. Case in point: Autumn Whitefield-Madrano (who runs a terrific blog called “The Beheld”) has done a “split-face” experiment using Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair. While this kind of study doesn’t take the place of a controlled clinical study, it does demonstrate the kind of critical thinking that the Beauty Brains champion. So, Autumn has graciously agreed to share her experimental results with our readers. Enjoy! Wrinkle Cream Assessment (by Autumn Whitefield-Madrano) At age 34, I’m only just now tiptoeing into the world of anti-aging creams. My inborn skepticism has always led me to believe that most creams are snake oil—but when I started seeing fine lines creep up on my face, even snake oil viscerally seemed like it just might be worth a shot. The best way to test its efficacy–not in some company’s lab, but on me? Applying anti-aging cream to half my face for a month. The results Well, the cream (Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair, for the curious) lived up to its eponymous claim: It did rapidly “repair” my wrinkles, to a degree. I could tell a difference in the length and depth of the fine lines that crinkle up beneath my eyes when I smile, and so could 59% of people who examined close-up photos of my face. (Only 15% of people guessed flat-out wrong; the rest couldn’t tell a difference.) Visualizing with Visia I went in for a Visia skin analysis, which confirmed what I’d detected: There were fewer wrinkles on the treated side of my face. But when the spa director at Sensitive Touch in New York looked more carefully at the other results of my Visia scan, she advised me to stop using the cream altogether. Visia showed that I had more spots and irritation on the treated side of my face. The difference between the halves of my face wasn’t dramatic—about as dramatic as the “wrinkle repair”—but it begged the question: At what point is the tradeoff of mild skin damage for mild wrinkle improvement no longer worth it? The cream’s packaging clearly instructs users to discontinue use if signs of irritation or rash appear. But as anyone who’s used even a mild retinol knows, skin irritation isn’t some kooky, infrequent side effect, like, say, the weird dreams that accompany anti-smoking drug Chantix. We expect that irritation—when half my face started seriously flaking a week into the experiment, I took it as par for the course. But that was just the visible side effect: Had I not had a high-tech skin analysis done, I might not have realized that my skin was continually being irritated, even after it had adjusted as seen by the naked eye. (I’ll admit that the peculiarities of my experiment prevent me from getting too up in arms about it: A half-face of flaky, peeling skin is even weirder-looking than a full face of the same.) Plus, the cornucopia of sunscreen agents in this particular ensures better broad-spectrum protection…but one of those agents, homosalate, is known for drying and tightening the skin. Pros and cons The series of tradeoffs—broad spectrum protection for heightened chance of irritation; mild retinol benefits for mild retinol damage—might be worth it for some. Frankly, I’m not sure it’s worth it for me—but I’m not sure it’s not worth it, either. I think my reluctance indicates that scientific proof of a treatment’s efficacy isn’t really what I’m after when I spend that meditative moment applying cream every night. I’m more after the idea that I’m doing something brief but concrete to help myself age gracefully. The cream I used has a nice feel (love that dimethicone!), making me feel like every night I was indulging myself (well, half of myself) in a feminine ritual. I know that sunscreen, yoga, and getting my five-a-day are the true routes to aging gracefully—but despite its underwhelming visible effects, I just may keep this cream as a companion along the way.

"The Beauty Brains","2016-12-02 08:32:00","Hair Hot Iron Damage: Which products really work? by The Beauty Brains Heat styling is the most popular way to straighten and shape your hair. Unfortunately, it can also be very bad for you. This article explains why high temperature styling is bad for hair and tells you where to buy products with the best ingredients to protect your hair from heat. Why heat is bad for hair? Heat exposure causes three types of hair damage: 1) decomposition of hair pigment (melanin) which cause changes in hair coloration; 2) damage to the fiber surface which makes the hair feel rough and look dull, and 3) weakening of internal hair proteins which can result in increased breakage. These effects are greatest when hair is exposed to temperatures above 130C. Blow dryers, curling, and flat irons are all capable of inflicting significant heat damage. How do heat protection products work? No one knows for sure, but here are three possible theories to explain how heat protection products work: Uniform heat distribution Products that leave a “buffering” layer on hair can prevent direct contact between the heating appliance and the hair surface. This protective layer can help minimize local overheating effects. Reduced heat conduction Almost any product that makes the hair more slippery can claim heat protection because if the flat iron or curling iron slides through the hair more quickly there is less likelihood of damage. This effect can reduce heat conduction and therefore decrease damage. Oxidation-prevention At least one study suggests that the thermal decomposition of hair protein is caused by an oxidation reaction. Since oxidation and reduction are opposite chemical reactions, a reducing chemical like sodium bisulfite or ascorbic acid may stop the damaging reaction. How is heat protection measured? Heat protection can be measured using a variety of experimental techniques. Three common methods are: 1) Combing analysis to measure increases or decreases in hair surface roughness, 2) Fluorescence spectroscopy to analyze the breakdown of hair protein (usually tryptophan), and 3) Texture analysis to show changes in the mechanical properties of hair tresses. (Reference: J. Cosmet. Sci., 49, 245-256 (July/August 1998) Thermal degradation of hair. II. Effect of selected polymers and surfactants R. McMULLEN and J. JACHOWICZ, InternationalSpecialty Products,Wayne, NJ 07470.) Which ingredients really work? There are dozens (hundreds? thousands?) of products that claim to protect hair from heat damage. Do they really work? The scientific literature shows only a few chemical compounds that have been studied and shown to provide a real, measurable benefit. For best results, look for leave-in treatment products that have these ingredients in listed toward the top of the ingredient list (in the first 5 ingredients, or so): PVP/DMAPA acrylates copolymer Hydrolyzed wheat protein Quaternium 70 (This doesn’t mean these are the ONLY ingredients in the universe that really work, but these are the only ones that have published data. Strong reducing ingredients that work by the oxidation-prevention mechanism described above are not recommended because they may cause other types of hair damage.) What about “heat activated?” One final note: be careful not to confuse “heat protection” with “heat activation.” Activation simply means the product undergoes some kind of change when heat is applied. Typically this refers to setting agents (in technical jargon, thermoplastic resins) which melt at the temperature of blow dryers or irons, and therefore form tighter bonds with the hair.

"The Beauty Brains","2017-09-15 08:39:00","Can cosmetics really change color to match your skin? by The Beauty Brains Products like Smashbox O-Glow Blush and Jemma Kidd Lip Gloss claim to to change color to match your skin tone or even match your mood. Is that really possible? Can cosmetics somehow detect your natural skin tone or even your emotional state and then adjust their color to match? The answer is no: This beauty myth is quite popular but it’s simply not true. This article explains how color changing products REALLY work. 3 types of color-changing chemistry 1. Ingredients that change color with pH/solubility Most of the products that we see that make these claims use this approach. The main ingredient that provides the effect is a colorant known as “Red 27,” a red dye which is colorless when dissolved in a waterless base. When it comes in contact with moisture, the change in solubility and pH causes the dye to turn bright pink. The product appears to change with your personal chemistry because the color changes when it comes in contact with moisture can come from your skin, or even just the humidity in the air. Red 27 can be used in powdered cosmetics, waxy sticks, and gels. Example products that use Red 27: Stila Custom Color Blush Smashbox O-Glow Blush DuWop Personal Color Changing Lipstick 2. Encapsulated colors Some products use colorants that are coated with waxy or gel-like ingredients and suspended in an uncolored base. When the product is rubbed into your skin the friction breaks open the dye capsules releasing the color. The product appears to change with your personal chemistry because the more your rub in the color, the more is released. Encapsulated colors work best in cream and powder based products. Example product that uses encapsulated colors: Intuitive Blend Shade Adjusting Foundation by Wet n’ Wild 3. Skin protein reaction Products that provide a “natural tan glow” work by using an ingredient called “dihydroxyacetone” or DHA. This chemical reacts with the keratin protein in the upper layers of your skin, staining them a light orangish-brown color. The product appears to change with your personal chemistry because it uses low levels of DHA that provides a very gradual change in skin color. The more you use, the more pronounced the “glow” effect is. Example product that uses a skin protein reaction: Jergen’s Natural Glow Does age, skin color, or other factors affect how they work? As described above, the chemistry involved in the color change has little to do with the a woman’s individual skin chemistry. However, the color of her skin will have a significant effect on the appearance of the cosmetic color. As your skin color changes (either with age or sun exposure) the color of these cosmetics could look different. This is not an issue for lip products since the skin on your lips doesn’t lip color doesn’t change with age or sun exposure. Contraindications: Who should not use them? None of the chemistries we’ve seen used in these product have any special contraindications. Of course, as with any cosmetic, if you may be sensitive to specific ingredients that could cause an allergic reaction. If this occurs you should discontinue using the product as soon as you notice any warning signs such as redness or irritation.

"The Beauty Brains","","Is Octocrylene a safe sunscreen? by The Beauty Brains LisePunch asks.. .Why is Octocrylene being targeted as being dangerous? I am hearing all kinds of conflicting info about chemical sunblocks. The Left Brain responds: After this question on Octocrylene came up in our Forum I decided to dig a little deeper to find out if this controversy is really fact or just another beauty myth. Here’s what I found… Crying over Octocrylene To begin, it’s helpful to understand why we need Octocrylene in the first place. Does it do anything different from all the other sunscreens we have? The answer is yes: it provides improved sun protection. Although by itself Octocrylene isn’t a very good sunscreen, it can protect other UV absorbers from breaking down and it can even boost their performance. It also helps them coat the skin better. So Octocrylene is a great tool for boosting sunscreen efficacy. As with all sunscreens it has been thoroughly tested before it was approved. In the US, Octocrylene has been evaluated by the FDA and is considered safe for use up to 10% in the formula. Similarly, the EU allows its use up to 10% in a formula while Health Canada allows a maximum use level of 12%. With three independent approvals this looks pretty safe, so why the controversy? There are two reasons. Potential irritant There are a number of reports in the literature about Octocrylene causing irritation. Octocrylene had 2 reported cases of irritation in 2003 but according to an article published in the Contact Dermatitis journal , reports of positive patch testing have been increasing. Here’s some additional information from Medscape about sunscreen allergies . The Archives of Dermatology and the Dermatology Journal Online also discuss allergic responses Octocrylene. One theory is that Octocrylene appears to be a strong allergen leading to contact dermatitis in children and mostly photoallergic contact dermatitis in adults with an often-associated history of photoallergy from ketoprofen (a pain reliever). Patients with photoallergy from ketoprofen frequently have positive photopatch test reactions to octocrylene. These patients need to be informed of sunscreen products not containing octocrylene, benzophenone-3, or fragrances. DNA damage? The second part of the controversy is more serious because it involves potential DNA damage. Octocrylene is one of those ingredients that can be absorbed into the skin and some studies have shown that it may promote generation of potentially harmful free radicals when exposed to light. Since free radicals can damage DNA, there is concern that this ingredient might have contributed to an increased incidence of melanoma in sunscreen-users compared to non-users. Researchers say further studies are warranted to determine the true health impact of this ingredient. (References: Smartskincare.com ; ScienceDirect ) The Beauty Brains bottom line This beauty myth does have a kernel of truth to it. It seems like there is some legitimate concern regarding irritation for and children & some adults (still a minority of the population) will want to avoid it. And further research is warranted into the free radical damage that this ingredient could potentially cause. If you’re concerned about this ingredient, you may get some peace of mind by using an Octocrylene free sunscreen which you can buy here.

"The Beauty Brains","","How does chinaglaze crackle nail polish work? by The Beauty Brains The latest trend in nail polish products are “crackle glazes” that give your nails an artsy shattered look. Both OPI and China Glaze are featuring these new glazes in their Spring collections. Today we talk about how these new polishes create this cool new look. How does ChinaGlaze crackle polish work? Crackling is a 3 step process. In the first step you apply a traditional base coat and let it dry completely. The second step is where the magic occurs: you apply the crackle layer over the base coat. In as little as 3 to 5 minutes the fissures form. Use a thin layer for a finely fractured pattern and a thick layer for a more chunky look. In the third step you apply a gloss coat that smooths the surface and adds shine. What’s the magic in crackle glaze? They’ve added a solvent (ethanol) to the polish that makes the film dry quickly and unevenly. This effect is the exact opposite of how nail polishes should normally behave – you want, slow even drying to ensure the smoothest finish. But by adding this alcohol to the formula they’ve created an imperfect film that shrinks as it dries, resulting in the cracks and crevices that show off the base coat. What should have been a formulation failure is now a new fabulous fashion trend. How clever!

"The Beauty Brains","","How to find the best beauty blogs by The Beauty Brains Whether you’re an avid beauty fan or a fellow beauty blogger who just wants to check out the “competition”, this resource will be helpful. Here are our top 10 favorite places to find the best beauty blogs. Professional Tracking Services Konector is a professional service that tracks blogs. They list the top 299 beauty blogs which is very thorough (although I’m not sure why they couldn’t just make it an even 300!) They even offer a service where you can send an email to all the bloggers at once, which could be very valuable if you have a press release or an important blog post you want to pass on. However, you have to pay to join their service if you want detailed info on their top 300 (I mean, 299). The only free information you’ll get is whether or not the blog has a Twitter stream or an RSS feed. Blogrank is our favorite service because they provide MUCH more detail. They rank blogs using an algorithm based on nine individual factors: Feedburner membership, Google Page Rank, unique monthly visitors, Yahoo and Google indexed pages, number of incoming links and ratio of links to pages, Alexa rank and Compete rank. It’s quite a thorough compilation! They update very frequently and the only downside is that they only list 50 blogs. I’d love to see their version of the top 100. Google Blog Search This approach won’t give you ranking of the best beauty blogs but it certainly generates a lot of possibilities. Just go to Google Blog Search , type in “beauty” and click “Homepages” on the left side bar. You’ll be presented with a list of over 1,000,000 blog homepages with beauty in the title. Technorati Technorati is a free blog tracking service with powerful search capabilities. Just type in “beauty” and you’ll find over 6,000 blogs on the topic along with their “authority” and Technorati rank. Popular magazine blog rolls Most of the beauty magazines either rank beauty blogs or at least have a blog roll you can peruse. Our favorite is Allure.com Daily Beauty Reporter’s “Sites We Love” sidebar (left-hand side, half way down the page.) Other Beauty Blogs Of course many beauty blogs compile their own list of faves. For example, here’s one from Makeup Moxie . About.com and other information sites About.com is a great source of information on just about any topic, so of course they have their own best beauty blog list. (BTW, The Beauty Brains was number 1 in their 2011 Readers Choice Poll!) Skincare-news.com’s list is a bit dated (from 2009) but it features well written summaries for each blog. Then again, maybe I’m just biased because they described us as “a group of hip and witty cosmetic scientists answers your questions about beauty, skin care and hair by going beyond hype and enticing labels to explain the science behind it all.” Link baiters Some sites create a list of favorite blog and then ask the “winners” to link back to them so their site gets more Google juice. This is not necessarily a bad thing (there’s not such thing as bad publicity, just look at Charlie Sheen!) but if you’re using one of these sites as a reference just remember that the blogs they list may not be chosen for their objective quality as much as for the writer’s desire to get a link back. Regardless of their motivation, it’s still kind of flattering when it happens. Here’s one example: Spa Beauty School . Where do YOU find your favorite beauty blogs?

"The Beauty Brains","","Do Temporary Hair Straighteners Work? by The Beauty Brains Vjrad asks.. .One of your posts discusses dangerous permanent straightening options such as Brazilian keratin treatments. What about temporary inexpensive drugstore straighteners that are supposed to last till your next shampoo, such as the ones by Garnier and John Frieda? Are they safe? The Garnier one smells HORRIBLE!! The Right Brain replies: We’ve written before about 7 Sure Ways To Straighten Your Hair . The two products you asked about are kind of a combination of these. John Frieda 3 Day Straight Frieda’s 3 Day Straight works by using silicone to coat your hair (#1 on our list of 7 straighteners). By coating each hair and then treating it with a flat iron (which is #3 on the list) you can get your hair reasonably straight and it will last pretty well as long as you don’t shampoo it. (Frieda’s 3 day claim is based on not washing your hair, as you can tell from reading the package: “Transforms curly, frizzy hair into a straight, smooth style that lasts up to 3 days.* *or until your next shampoo if less than 3 days.”) So, this product is very safe but you may find that it doesn’t work all that well either, depending on how hard it is for you to keep your hair straight. Garnier Blow Dry Perfector Garnier’s product works entirely differently. It’s a two part system consisting of a smoothing serum and a conditioning cream. The serum contains a mixture of chemicals (Cysteine and Ethanolamine) that react with the protein structure of your hair. (Similar to #5 on our list, but without the formaldehyde). This process is safer than the classic Brazilian Straighteners but it also doesn’t straighten as well. And, because it chemically reacts with protein, it can damage and weaken your hair. Read Garnier Blow Dry Perfector Ingredients The Beauty Brains bottom line Both of these products are good alternatives to treatments that use dangerous levels of formaldehyde, but neither are perfect solutions. Frieda is safe and non-damaging but doesn’t provide intensive straightening. Garnier provides a more potent straightening effect but it can chemically damage your hair.

"Perry Romanowski","","Is organix brazilian keratin therapy a safe way to straighten hair? by Perry Romanowski CurlyB asks… A couple of months ago, Organix came out with its own formaldehyde-free BKT, the “Organix Brazilian Keratin Therapy 30-Day Smoothing Treatment”. I was thrilled to find a grocery store product at a reasonable price that contains no formaldehyde or other -hyde ingredients. I bought it, tried it, and loved the product. It did a very good job of decreasing frizz and relaxing my kinky hair into smooth loose curls. However, I’m reluctant to try it again because I can’t find out much about one of the first ingredients, oxoacetamide. The instructions contain some strong wording about ventilating the area where the treatment is performed, which adds to my concern that there is some pretty harmful stuff in there. Is this product safe for regular use? Or should I limit or discontinue these treatments? The Right Brain responds: Organix Brazilian Keratin Therapy contains similar chemistry as the Fructis Blow Dry Perfector Kit which we discussed in our previous article on temporary hair straighteners . Fructis uses cysteine and ethanolamine to rearrange the bonds in your hair where Organix uses oxoacetamide and carbocysteine. These products are safer than their formaldehyde-containing cousins but they do cause some degree of damage to your hair by the nature of the chemical reaction they use to change the hair structure. How does Organix work? The best description we’ve seen actually comes from yet another product that uses the same technology: BIOKERATINE BY JJC PARIS . Here’s how Biokeratine explains how their product works: “Hair is basically composed by the alpha-keratin protein which is responsible for 80-90% by weight of the mass of hair. The major amino acid present in the keratin is the cysteine, responsible for the cysteine links. The Cystine can interact with another cysteine in the same polypeptide chain and form a covalent bond. These bonds are responsible for “waves” that appear on our hair. It’s a revolutionary new system to make a global smoothing, promoting straightening, the relaxation of curls and still has actives that are repairing the damage caused by chemical processes, all in a single step. It enables the interconversion of the oxidized form of cysteine in a reduced form, thus modeling the hair becomes possible and easy.” Basically, here’s what this means: The bonds in your hair that help hold its shape contain an amino acid called cysteine. When you use a product that adds more cysteine to your hair (under the right conditions of pH and temperature) you can rearrange some of the cysteine bridges and force your hair into a straighter shape.

"The Beauty Brains","","What beauty companies don’t want you to know about foundation by The Beauty Brains Emily asks… I’ve read in so many magazines that have said tinted moisturizers are better than foundation on the skin. What exactly is the difference between tinted moisturizers and liquid foundation apart from the fact that tinted moisturizers is lighter? I’ve also heard from some friends that tinted moisturizers are bad for your skin. So are tinted moisturizers good or bad? The Right Brain responds : Elizabeth Arden makes both kinds of products so let’s look at the ingredients in their Sheer Lights Illuminating Tinted Moisturizer and Bare Perfection Flawless Finish Foundation as an example. We won’t reprint all of the ingredients here but you can find them on Drugstore.com. Both products contain sunscreens as active ingredients. They both use water as a solvent and they both contain mixtures of humectants (chemicals that bind water to skin) and emollients (oily chemicals that smooth skin and create a moisture barrier). Since these are emulsion-type products they both use surfactants that keep the water and oil soluble ingredients mixed together in a creamy base. Of course they both contain preservatives and ingredients to control the thickness and pH. And, since both are designed to give your skin a bit of color, they contain pigments. Specifically they both use iron oxides and titanium dioxide. They sound pretty similar, don’t they? They are similar, but not identical. How are they different? Well, the amount of color they contain will vary and so will the consistency of the products. And the moisturizer version appears to have more humectants so we’d guess it will bind water to your skin better. But overall, they both are basically delivery vehicles for skin tinting pigments. Given the similarities, it’s hard to imagine why one product would be “bad” for you and the other wouldn’t. Now, if you have very dry skin, you may prefer the moisturizing version. And likewise if your skin is oily, you might want to use the lighter version. But this isn’t a case of “good” versus “bad.” It’s more about finding what you like. (This reminds me of the question we had about the religious implications of using make up .) The Beauty Brains Bottom Line: Tinted moisturizers and foundations may look and feel different, but ultimately they function the same way. In case you didn’t realize, the beauty industry often takes similar products and makes them sound very different. There’s nothing wrong with that, as long as they’re honest about the products’ benefits. You’ll have to experiment with different products to cut through all this hype and and find the one that’s right for you.","What beauty companies don’t want you to know about foundation","d35f09b83d76f1d53a4cf3c1fd68a7d22bef3a6f","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2011/07/what-beauty-companies-dont-want-you-to-know-about-foundation/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Are You Using the Wrong Shampoo? by The Beauty Brains Karlaxox’s question… My daughter has blonde hair and her hair is quite fine too,and for shampoo she uses Pantene Aqua Light and Johnson’s Baby Shampoo. Are these the shampoos she should be using or are they the wrong shampoos she should be using? The Left Brain responds: We’re often asked questions like this. Unfortunately, the idea that you need to avoid using the “wrong” shampoo is often times more of a Marketing issue than a scientific one. You didn’t tell us if your daughter likes these products or not. If she likes the way they make her hair look and feel, then there’s absolutely no reason they’re “wrong” for her hair type. On the other hand, if she’s dissatisfied with some aspects of their performance, she should consider changing. Here are some of the common issues she might have with her hair and our assessment of how these products probably perform. Reasons to try a different shampoo Crappy cleansing It’s unlikely her issue is “this shampoo doesn’t get my hair clean enough” because all shampoos clean hair pretty well. We’ve only seen this become a problem in the case of heavy styling product users and then our advice is to switch to a stronger cleansing system (something with Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, for example.) Vanishing volume If your daughter has fine hair, maintaining body and volume could be a key concern. Fortunately, neither of the shampoos you mentioned are intended to provide a lot of conditioning that can weigh your hair down so they should be generally suitable for use on fine hair. Shoddy shine This one could be tricky because you have to walk a fine line to get the shine that you want. Too little conditioning can leave hair rough and dry which will cause the cuticles (the outer protective layer of your hair) to scatter light, instead of smoothly reflecting it. This will give you less shine. On the other hand, too much conditioning (especially with certain types of silicones and polymers) can leave a film on hair that makes it look dull. Aqua Light and J&J’s Baby Shampoo provide a low level of conditioning so they may not be providing enough shine. Horrible hair color Unless the shampoo is a color-deposting product (which neither of these are) it won’t dramatically affect her hair color. Again, some shampoos can leave too much of a conditioning layer on the hair which can make blonde hair lose some of its highlights. Also, if you live in a area with hard water, you might find that the minerals in the water are turning her hair a brassier shade of blonde. If that’s the case, try a different kind of clarifying shampoo. Missing manageability If she can’t comb and style her hair after washing her hair she may need a shampoo with additional conditioning agents. Of course, the products she’s using after shampooing are even more important when it comes to manageability. Conditioners (rinse out as well as leave in) and styling products (like mousses and hairsprays) will affect the way her hair looks and feels. The Beauty Brains bottom line The right shampoo is the one that makes your hair look and feel the way you want it too. Don’t let anyone tell you that you’re using the “wrong” product for your hair type unless you’re having a specific problem with your hair. Do you want to see more beauty myths busted?

"The Beauty Brains","","Why your doctor tells you not to wear nail polish? by The Beauty Brains Nicky needs to know… I’m having sinus surgery on my nose but my doctor said to be sure not to wear nail polish during surgery. I can’t figure out what nail polish on my fingers has to do with an operation on my nose. I’m too embarrassed to ask my doctor. Can you explain it for me? The Left Brain responds: Nicky, we’re cosmetic scientists, not medical professionals, but we can guess why your doctor is concerned about your nail polish. Love is like oxygen During surgery doctors track vital signs like your heart rate, blood pressure, and the amount of oxygen in your blood. Blood oxygenation is measured using a little device that clamps on to your finger which is known as a “pulse oximeter.” The oximeter works by shining light through your finger nail and measuring how much light is absorbed. The more light that is absorbed, the more oxygen that is in your blood. Your doctor could be worried that nail polish could interfere with this measurement. But is this concern valid? Interestingly, the answer may be “no.” A study conducted at the University of Southern California has shown that nail polish does NOT interfere with the pulse oximetry. The study revealed that neither nail polish nor artificial nails significantly interfered with light absorption from the device. Say “no” to nail polish So, does that mean you can ignore your doctor’s advice and where a nice shade of OPI to your sinus surgery? I’m afraid not! There’s another reason that wearing nail polish in the operating room is a bad idea. Surgeons have a “backup” way to check blood oxygen just in case the pulse oximeter fails. It’s called “looking at your nails.” If your blood oxygen drops to a dangerously low level, your finger nails will start to turn blue. Nail polish will mask this color change so the doctor won’t be able to visually check your blood oxygen. The risk is very low, but by keeping your nails unpolished you’re helping your doctor keep you safe. The Beauty Brains bottom line Beautiful nails are not worth the risk! Even though the odds of anything going wrong in your surgery are very small you should still listen to your doctor’s advice and NOT wear nail polish the day of your procedure.

"The Beauty Brains","","Can brava give you better boobs? by The Beauty Brains Andrea asks: I would like to have a larger bust, but I really don’t want implants. I have heard of the Brava Breast Enhancement system, which seems to be endorsed by a lot of plastic surgeons, and some scientific studies. Do you have any inside info or insight? The Left Brain responds: If we keep getting questions about bras and breast enhancement I’ll have to add a special Boob category on the sidebar! For those of you in the Beauty Brains community who are not familiar with the Brava system, it supposedly works by gently pulling on your breasts which keeps them under tension for hours at a time. This sustained tension causes the cells to grow new tissue that makes your breasts appear larger and fuller. How does BRAVA work According to the the BRAVA website, the System consists of two semi-rigid domes, with specially engineered silicone gel rims, and a sophisticated minicomputer, called a SmartBox, that creates and regulates the tension within the domes. Semi-rigid domes? Engineered silicone rims? Sophisticated minicomputer? Is this a breast enhancer or some kind of Terminator Robot from the Future? But I digress. The real question is: does it really work? Since our forte is cosmetic chemistry, not breast enhancement, we asked our friend Dr. Rob Oliver over at Plastic Surgery 101 to give his expert opinion. Based on his experience, Dr. Rob says that Brava doesn’t work well, it’s uncomfortable, and must be worn for weeks before you see results, if you see any at all. He’s aware of very few people who use or endorse it. The Beauty Brains bottom line: That’s good enough for me – I’ll take the opinion of a doctor and scientist over the hype from the company selling the product any day. Dr. Rob said he’d try to post more details on his blog, so keep your eye on Plastic Surgery 101 . In the meantime, if any of the Beauty Brains community has used this device I’d be curious to hear your experience. If you haven’t used it, I suggest you save your money.

"The Beauty Brains","","The Red-Faced Regret of Rosacea by The Beauty Brains Katy has cause for concern: I have clusters of dry, red raised bumps on either side of my chin. I’ve been using hydrocortisone that helps but doesn’t cure them. I also have a flush to my cheeks and am prone to blushing, which are two characteristics of Rosacea. Does this sound like Rosacea and do you know of any better remedies Hydrocortisone? The Right Brain rambles on Rosacea: Katy, based on your description you might have a form of Rosacea but you really should really check with a dermatologist for the best course of treatment. Your question prompted us to include Rosacea in our Cosmetic Diseases and Disorders Series so everyone gains a better understanding of this condition. Hopefully you’ll find this information helpful. What is Rosacea? Rosacea is an inflammatory skin condition that causes the skin around your nose, cheeks, chin and eyes to become very red and flushed. Over 14 million Americans suffer from this neurovascular disorder, according to the National Rosacea Society. Why is this such a disturbing disorder? Because it’s more than just a simple case of being red-faced! The condition has psychological effects as well. The Society has done studies that show nearly 70 percent of Rosacea sufferers have lowered self-esteem, and 41 percent say that the condition causes them to avoid public contact or cancel social engagements. What causes Rosacea? No one knows for sure but there are several theories. It could be related to how facial blood vessels cope with being flushed and dilated. Or, it could be that it’s an over active inflammatory response to some unknown pathogen. Though the exact cause is unknown, we do know that it can be worsened by harsh skin treatments, strong acne medications, and even exposure to excessive sunlight. How can you tell if you have Rosacea? Again, you should consult your dermatologist to find out if your condition really is Rosacea. But here are some common symptoms you can look for. The redness associated with Rosacea primarily occurs in the flushing zone, the nose, cheeks, chin and forehead. Besides the reddening, you may see dilated blood vessels and facial swelling. You may also feel a slight burning sensation on your face. Inflammatory papules and pustules (the red bumps you described?) may develop as well. You should also note that Rosacea starts as mild episodes of facial blushing or flushing which can turn into a permanently red face over time. There is a special type of Rosacea, known as Ocular Rosacea, that affects both the eye surface and eyelid. This condition can cause redness, dry eyes, redness, crusting and even loss of eyelashes. What does Rosacea look like? You can see for yourself by checking out these links, but some of these are a bit disturbing so use your discretion. 3 Photos of mild Rosacea More photos of severe Rosacea What can you do about Rosacea? We didn’t find any reference to using hydrocortisone to fight Rosacea, but there are other medications that are used to control the redness and reduce the number of papules and pustules. The most commonly used drugs are oral antibiotics and topical metronidazole. Isotretinoin ( Accutane ) has also been shown to work against severe papopustular rosacea because it physically shrinks sebaceous glands and it has potent anti-inflammatory properties. And there has been some discussion that topical application of a drug called Finacea may be a promising treatment as well. You’ll need a prescription form your doctor for all of these though. There are some things you can do without a prescription: according to the experts, you should use a gentle cleansing regime to avoid aggravating the condition. So make sure you’re using a mild facial cleanser and not scrubbing too much! You should also limit sun exposure by protecting your skin with a good non-irritating sunscreen everyday. You might find a product that uses physical sunblock ingredients like zinc oxide or titanium dioxide might be less aggravating than some of the reactive sunscreens. For much, much more on this subject, visit the Rosacea Support Group or the excellent Rosacea Blog.","The Red-Faced Regret of Rosacea","f9f60c4316063204e830d787d92f2269466651d2","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2007/04/the-red-faced-regret-of-rosacea/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Does aveeno ultra calming lotion reduce rosacea? by The Beauty Brains Christine`s also concerned about Rosacea: I have fairly bad rosacea, my cheeks, forehead, nose, and chin are always more pink than the rest of my face. If I drink alcohol or caffeine, or eat spicy foods, those areas become VERY red. I became excited when I saw that Aveeno came out with a moisturizer clinically proven to reduce the visibility of redness. Does this product work for rosacea, or is it just for people who have pink tones in their fair skin? The Right Brain `s red-faced reply: As you know if you read our recent post on Rosacea , there are only a few drugs that have been proven to be effective in the reducing redness. The Aveeno product you referenced (the ULTRA-CALMING DAILY MOISTURIZER WITH SPF 15 ) doesn`t contain any of these drugs but it does include a combination of sunscreens that can prevent Rosacea prone skin from turning red in the first place. That doesn`t necessarily mean that it will help you, but it does address at least one of the causal factors of Rosacea so it may be worth a try. Let us know how it works for you!

"The Beauty Brains","","5 ways to protect your hair from over-washing by The Beauty Brains Yu Li’s question: I usually shampoo late at night and then again in the morning when I get up. Over the last few years, I’ve felt that my hair at the mid section and ends has gotten really dry. It is possible that I’m washing my hair too often? The Right Brain replies: First of all, if you’re noticing a change in your hair over several years, it may not be from the over-washing at all. It could be related to hormonal changes or changes in your diet or medication and not your hair washing at all. Or just plain aging! But, if you are washing your hair so frequently it is possible that you doing some serious damage to your strands. Even wetting your hair can be damaging because water swells the hair shaft. Here are five precautions you can take to protect your hair, Beauty Brains style! 1. Rock Me Gently – use a mild shampoo If you don’t use a lot of styling products you shouldn’t need a deep cleansing shampoo. Stick with something that’s less likely to irritate your scalp and dry your hair, like a baby shampoo. It’s hard to beat Johnson’s for the price, but you could go crazy and buy some Angel Baby products. 2. Strange Condition – be sure to use a leave in or rinse out . Depending on your hair type you’ll have to be careful not to over condition. But use SOME kind of conditioner to prevent further damage. (And although we’ve never proved it, we’ve seen data that suggest certain conditioners can even make your hair dry faster which leads us to out next tip…) 3. Water Runs Dry – Towel drying can tear your hair. Remember, it’s not just the shampooing itself that’s bad for you hair. It’s what you do after you get out of the shower. Towel drying roughs up the cuticle. Blot your hair dry instead of scrubbing it dry. Or use one of those special super-absorbent towels . 4. Slippery When Wet – wet hair is easy to break. You can gently detangle with a wide tooth comb , but don’t comb or brush your hair when it’s still wet. Why? Because wet hair stretches and breaks easier than dry hair! 5. It’s a Heat Wave – reduce heat styling Any damage you do to your hair is just made worse with heat. Cut back on heat styling if you can. If you can’t, use a good leave in product, like a flat iron spray , to help diffuse the heat. For the bonus round: can any of our loyal Beauty Brainiacs name the bands that go with the 5 song titles in this post?","5 ways to protect your hair from over-washing","8410e05aa853ce1ae09f4c0cd644ec499a06dc60","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2007/04/5-ways-to-protect-your-hair-from-over-washing/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Avoid pedicure infections with 3 simple steps by The Beauty Brains A pedicure can hideously disfigure your legs. Ok, maybe that’s a bit of an exaggeration, but pedicures can be dangerous, at least according to one dermatologist’s report . The report describes a case in which 110 women developed persistent red boils on their legs after having their toe nails done in a nail salon . It turns out that the infected sore were caused by a skin disease called mycobacterial furunuculosis. Further investigation showed that the whirlpool baths the women used were contaminated with Mycobacterium fortuitum , the bacteria that cause this condition. Two factors made the situation even worse: First, their salon used the throne type footbaths that are mounted to the chair (as opposed to the plain foot baths that can be picked up and washed in a sink.) These throne type baths are more likely to be contaminated because they’re harder to clean. Second, 70% of the women who contracted the disease had shaved their legs prior to their treatment which left them even more vulnerable to attack by the bacteria. While this condition is treatable with antibiotics, the infection can be tough to get rid of and it can leave the legs seriously scarred. So, to make sure you`re safe out there, here are the Beauty Brains’ tips on how to protect yourself during a pedicure: 1.) Get off the throne The common denominator in these cases was the throne type footbath. So get off the “throne” and use a plain footbath that is thoroughly washed and disinfected between uses. 2.) Wait until after your pedicure to shave Since shaving your legs can open up tiny cuts in the skin through which bacteria can enter, you’re much safer if you shave AFTER your pedicure. Remember, shaving was a risk factor for infection in 70% of the patients. 3.) Don’t be promiscous with your choice of salon The salon in this study had 110 customers who became infected. Knowing the people who run the salon and knowing others who use their services will increase your chances of being tipped off to a problem before you`re the next victim. If you consistently use the same salon you’ll be better off in the long run. The Brains Bottom Line: Sure your nails look good with a coat of Orly or OPI . But your legs DON’T look good covered in oozing red sores. So use some salon smarts and protect yourself from pedicure panic.","Avoid pedicure infections with 3 simple steps","9b2d8621401d47b04aeb5754027d279231373ff6","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2007/04/avoid-pedicure-infections-with-3-simple-steps/"
"The Beauty Brains","2017-12-21 04:47:00","Does aloe cure acne scars? by The Beauty Brains Vain-ity asking about aloe: I’ve read raves on two websites ( acne.org & makeupalley.com ) about aloe right out of the plant to heal acne scars. This is important for me as I have acne scars on my dark skin and had no luck with hydroquinone or kojic acid. I’ve scooped out the insides an aloe plant and gave it a whirl in the blender (with a teaspoon of lime juice as a preservative) and kept it refrigerated. I’ve used it for a week at night and I love the texture of my aloe goo and not the smell but do you think it can lighten my acne scars? Does it have any effects other than being a skin soother? Of course I want it to work because the plant costs a mere dollar but I’m a bit skeptical of a simple plant and its raves in the cyberworld. The Right Brain replies: First of all, we’re not surprised that hydroquinone or kojic acid isn’t fading your acne scars. Those chemicals work best on dark spots caused by increased melanin pigment which is caused by sun exposure. Acne scars are formed by a different mechanism. Aloe and acne Using aloe on acne is actually an interesting notion. We couldn’t find anything in the literature to directly support the idea, but Dr. Zoe Draelos taught us the theory behind how aloe works on burns . She says that aloe’s natural film forming and antibacterial properties can help heal skin. So at least in theory, it makes sense that a coating of aloe could prevent acne scars from forming. It seems unlikely, however, that aloe would have any benefit when applied to aged scars. The Beauty Brains bottom line There’s no real evidence to prove aloe really works on acne scars, but there’s at least a theoretical mechanism by which is might work. So if you’re willing to experiment, give it a try and see if it works for you. And if you’re looking for another use for all that fresh squeezed aloe, you should read Sarah Bellum’s response to Kristin’s question about using aloe as personal lubricant (You know how Sarah Bellum LOVES to blog about personal lubricants!)

"The Beauty Brains","","8 ways to fight dandruff and itchy scalp by The Beauty Brains Alejandra’s itchy inquiry: I cannot get rid of my dandruff and itchy scalp . I know we are all different but do you know of dandruff shampoos that work or other ways of dealing with dandruff. Thank you!!! The Right Brain’s scratchy reply: Dandruff is caused by a yeast-like fungus known as malassezia that makes your scalp flake and itch. There are a variety of solutions but they don’t always work equally well for everyone so you may need to try several products before you find the one that’s right for you. Here’s a list of some dandruff destroyers that you might want to check. Zinc pyrithione Antifungal agent found in Selsun Salon and Head and Shoulder. Effective against dandruff and seborrheic dermatitis. Coal Tar As the name suggests, this active ingredient comes from the coal manufacturing process and can be found in Neutrogena T/Gel. Treats dandruff, seborrheic dermatitis and psoriasis by reducing cell turnover. Salicylic acid This hydroxy acid helps eliminate flakes but may require a conditioner to prevent your scalp from becoming overly dry. Can be found in Ionil T. Selenium sulfide Another chemical that reduces cell turnover and fights malassezia. May discolor blonde, gray or chemically colored hair. Found in Selsun Blue. Ketoconazole Formerly available only be prescription, this antifungal drug fights the cause of dandruff. Found in Nizoral. Prescription drugs If none of these over the counter dandruff shampoos work for you, ask your doctor for prescription dandruff fighters like Loprox or steroid lotions. Copper brushes The Left Brain bashed using copper brushes to stop dandruff in an earlier post because there have been no studies that we could find that support that. Nonetheless, a lot of people swear that it works for them. New technology Future research may bring us better ways. Like the dandruff shampoo you can drink .

"The Beauty Brains","","Do sulfate shampoos cause hair color loss? by The Beauty Brains Tina’s turmoil: I have been along time reader of another blog called Killer Strands and the writer (Dakota Ellis/Killer Chemist) is a hair colourist and a cosmetic chemist who has tested sulphate shampoos and proved it does fade color and may cause premature hair loss. She mentions it’s very caustic when smelled and may cause you to to faint when opening a jar of SLS ! The Left Brain’s reply: Sulfate shampoos do cause fading however, they do not cause more fading than other types of shampoos. I can say that because I specifically evaluated all types of shampoos in unpublished research. But until that is published, it’s just hearsay. If you really wanted to prove it to yourself, use 2 different shampoos on each side of your head the next time you get your color done. One should be a sulfate based shampoo and the other should be non-sulfate based. After 5-10 washes you will not likely see any color difference between the two. Dangerous sulfates? The idea that sulfates make your hair fall out is just not true. No cosmetic chemist has ever proven this. Furthermore, while they are powerful degreasers and can dry out hair and skin, they are not caustic. And the notion that you will faint just by smelling a sulfate detergent is ridiculous. Sulfates have a weak, bland odor (it’s true that inhaling concentrated SLS can irritate your nasal passages but that will not make you faint.) We have been in the cosmetic and personal care industry for many years and have not come across any published scientific study to show that sulfates are the worst thing for your hair color or would make your hair fall out. I suspect if you asked the Killer Strands folks for their data they won’t have any. And without the data, it’s just an unvalidated opinion. Killer Strands I looked up the Killer Strands website and it appears to be very professional and it contains a lot of good information. Dakota is doing a fine job, but I couldn’t find any references to specific studies backing up her statements. You need to consider that while Killer Strands does make some good points, they are also trying to sell you their products and services. The Beauty Brains bottom line The Beauty Brains do not and will not sell cosmetic products.

"The Beauty Brains","None","Is aloe vera a good personal lubricant? by The Beauty Brains Kristin’s question: I know this isn’t actually a beauty question, but I can’t seem to find any good information on this topic. It turns out I can’t use “personal lubricants” with glycerin because they give me yeast infections. I’d prefer to stay away from parabens as well, just as a precaution. One option appears to be an aloe vera gel based lubricant. I believe aloe is mostly water, so it seems safe on that count. But is there any other reason why it might be unsafe to use? Sarah Bellum says: Before I answer your question, Kristen, I have a question of my own for Lefty and Righty: Why do I always get stuck answering questions like this??? First it was intimate shaving and Go Commando panty-free patches, then it was enhancement creams , now it’s personal lubricants. Do you have any idea how hard it is to find appropriate pictures for these posts?? And meanwhile, Righty gets to blog about goat poop ! It’s not fair!! Ok, now that I’ve got that out of my system, I’ll continue.. Why did you single out glycerin as the problem? As far as I can tell, there’s nothing unique about glycerin that would make it promote yeast infections. Maybe a better question to ask is: what does cause yeast infections? Causes of yeast infections There are many factors that contribute to candidiasis including: Antibiotic treatments Oral contraceptives Hot weather or non-ventilating clothing, which increase moisture and warmth, fostering fungal growth Repeated intercourse over a short period of time Stress Suppressed immune system (including HIV) High carbohydrate intake, especially refined sugars and alcohol Pregnancy Diabetes Irritants such as soaps, powders, new detergents and other products Could it be that you’ve been using a glycerine based product that contains another ingredient that’s upsetting your system? Maybe a preservative? You could try another glycerin based lube with different ingredients. Or, try a silicone based product that’s free of glycerin. That way you could tell for sure if glycerin is causing the problem. To help you in your quest, we present the carousel of love lubricants.

Most of the 100% pure products I’ve seen have other ingredients. Here are a few quick examples: Fruit of the Earth Aloe Vera 100% Gel Aloe Vera Gel, Triethanolamine, Tocopheryl Acetate, Carbomer 940, Tetrasodium EDTA, DMDM Hydantoin, Diazolidinyl Urea GNC Aloe Vera SKin Gel Water, Glycerin, Acrylates C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Triethanolamine, Polysorbate 20, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Fragrance, Propylene Glycol, Diazolidinyl Urea, Methylparaben, Propylparaben Jason Natural Cosmetics Aloe Vera 98%, Moisturizing Gel Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Gel (Aloe Vera), Aqua (Purified Water), Glycerin (Vege), Allantoin, Polysorbate 20, Panthenol (Vitamin B5), Potassium Carbomer, Arginine, Menthol (Natural), Benzyl Alcohol, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Chlorophyllin-Copper Complex, Essential Oil Blend Aubrey Organics 100% Aloe Vera Organic Aloe Vera, Aloe Vera Oil, Aubrey’s Preservative (Citrus Seed Extract, Vitamins A, C and E). So chose your aloe carefully! The Beauty Brains bottom line Before you jump to aloe products that aren’t designed for intimate use, you should be sure that glycerin is causing the problem.

"The Beauty Brains","None","Can cosmetic acupuncture reduce wrinkles? by The Beauty Brains Shirley says: Hi, I’ve read about the increasing popularity of cosmetic acupuncture. Can you please tell me about its possible side effects and whether it works to improve skin’s condition? Left Brain Laments This logical, less emotional Beauty Brain is usually unaffected by most of the nonsense propagated by the beauty industry. Fluff claims are relatively harmless and add fun to the cosmetic experience. But certain subjects like dubious beauty supplements, unsupported chemical scares, the inherent superiority of expensive brands, and questionable cosmetic treatments really unhinge my undies. Cosmetic acupuncture is one such subject. I’ll try to maintain control but I can’t promise anything. What is cosmetic acupuncture? According to this New York Times article, cosmetic acupuncture is an anti-aging treatment which involves practitioners sticking needles in your face to reduce wrinkles and other signs of aging. It’s supposed to be an alternative to a face lift. But more likely it’s placebo poppycock. Cosmetic acupuncture benefits The site Chimedicineworks lists the following benefits of cosmetic acupuncture. Promotes blood and lymph circulation ; increased circulation dilates peripheral blood vessels for better distribution of oxygen and nutrients as well as cellular regeneration. Rehydrates the skin’s external layers through stimulation of the secretion of the sweat and sebacious glands which encourages the regeneration of healthy skin cells. Helps exfolliation , aids the proliferation of new skin cells, increases nutrition to the skin’s surface, improves the quality of the skin and promotes a healthy glow. Allows healthy “breathing” of the skin , increasing the skin’s protective ability to ward off infections and clogged pores. Increases oxygen consumption of the skin’s external layer speeding up the release of carbon dioxide and nitrogen at the cellular level, helping to keep skin deeply clean; contributes to reducing the accumulation of excess grease on the skin’s surface. Stimulates the production of elastin and 4 collagen proteins in the skin to reduce and soften wrinkles. Reduces and relaxes the tension in the nerves and muscles improving the integrity of the skin resulting in improved overall facial appearance. All that from one kind of treatment? Wow. Now you might be wondering, is this stuff true? Let’s look at the claims and the science behind it. Deconstruction of Cosmetic Acupuncture Claims 1. Promotes circulation – The wording of this claim is important. They merely say circulation is promoted not that it is increased. There is no proof that sticking needles in your skin increases circulation. 2. Rehydrates the skin’s external layers – While needles might stimulate the sweat and sebacious glands, there certainly aren’t enough inserted to have much effect on skin moisture levels. This is unproven nonsense. 3. Helps exfoliation – Big deal. You can say almost anything you do to skin will “help” exfoliation. The claims of increasing skin nutrition is complete bogus. 4. Allows healthy “breathing” of the skin – Another fluff claim that doesn’t mean anything. Washing your face allows skin to “breath”. What is the new benefit offered here? 5. Increases oxygen consumption of the skin’s external layer – The skin’s external layer is made up of dead cells that don’t use oxygen. It’s baffling to me how acupuncture would increase the consumption of oxygen by dead cells. Plus, there is no proof that this even happens. More nonsense. 6. Stimulates the production of elastin and 4 collagen proteins – This just isn’t true. Poking yourself with needles has not been demonstrated to increase elastin and collagen levels in skin. 7. Reduces and relaxes the tension in the nerves and muscles – Of all the claims this one is the most plausible. Acupuncture is a relaxing procedure that could have some effect on muscle tension and thus slightly change your appearance. But that hardly seems worth $150 per treatment. Acupuncture is bunk For years people have been trying to prove that acupuncture has some scientific validity. And study after study demonstrates there is no benefit beyond a placebo effect. According to Quackwatch.com, the National Council Against Health Fraud concluded: Acupuncture is unproven Its theory and practice are based on primitive and fanciful concepts of health and disease that bear no relationship to present scientific knowledge Research during the past 20 years has not demonstrated that acupuncture is effective against any disease. Perceived effects of acupuncture are probably due to a combination of expectation, suggestion, counter-irritation, conditioning, and other psychologic mechanisms. Beauty Brains Bottom Line If you’re going to get a cosmetic procedure done, don’t waste money on acupuncture. Save up for a full blown face lift. At least that will be done by a reputable doctor and has been proven to work. And if surgery isn’t something you want to do, stick to the high quality facial products you can buy at your local drug store. They’re just as good as the department store products.

"The Beauty Brains","","How straightening shampoos work by The Beauty Brains Jane throws us a curve ball: Now that you’ve educated us about curl-enhancing shampoos , can you address the shampoos and rinse-out conditioners that claim to help straighten hair? The Right Brain straightens her out: As we’ve said before, shampoos that claim to magically make your hair curly are more bull sh** than beauty science. But making curly hair straight is another story – rinse out products can help, at least a little bit, if they deposit enough conditioning agents. How can shampoos straighten hair? Let’s be honest: no single use rinse off product can take the place of a straightening product like a relaxer or even a hair gel. If that’s what you’re looking for then you need to read about the 7 Sure Ways to Straighten Your Hair . But if you’re just looking to tame hair that’s just a tad too wavy or curly, then rinse out products may be able to help you. That’s because silicones, polymers, and other conditioning agents can deposit even after rinsing. These agents help weigh the hair down, fighting its natural tendency to curl up or frizz out. They won’t fully straighten hair, but they’re better than nothing. For example, here are two examples that contain guar hydroxypropyltrimonium chloride and certain silicones like Quaternium 80 that have substantial conditioning effects. Back to Basics Bamboo Straightening Shampoo Water (Eau), Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Cocamide MEA, Disodium Cocamphodiacetate, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, PEG 40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Perfume (Fragrance), Sodium Chloride, Propylene Glycol, Quaternium 80, Methylparaben, Polyquaternium 10, Hydroxypropyl Guar Hydroxpropyltrimonium Chloride, Citric Acid, Diazolidinyl Urea, Tetrasodium EDTA, Polyquaternium 7, Propylparaben, Sodium Hydroxide, Panthenol, Persea Gratissima Oil (Avocado), Penta Sodium Pentetate, Hedera Helix Extract (Ivy), Bambusa Vulgaris Extract Marc Anthony Instant Straightening Shampoo Water (Enriched with Silk, Silcone), Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Ammonium Lauryl Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Lauramide DEA, Disodium Cocoyl Glutamate, Acrylates C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Glycol Distearate, Hydroxyethyl Cellulose, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Oleth 2, Glycerin, Panthenol, Polyquaternium 7, Hydrolyzed Silk, Dimethicone, Cyclotetrasiloxane, Simethicone, Dimethiconol, Polysorbate 20, Triethanolamine, Citric Acid, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Tetrasodium EDTA, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylchloroisothiazoline, Fragrance, Blue 1, Yellow 5, Green 3, Mica, Titanium Dioxide (While both products may have a mild straightening effect, Marc Anthony got a bit carried away with his “instant straightening” claim which seems a bit misleading to us. We also love the way he “enriches” their water with silk and silicone.) The Beauty Brains bottom line No rinse off product can fully straighten hair. But if you need a touch of extra conditioning to smooth your hair, shampoos can help. Of course, you’ll have to experiment to find out what works on your hair type. What do YOU think?

"The Beauty Brains","None","How pure are 100% pure cosmetics? by The Beauty Brains Grace is not gullible: I’m watching QVC and they are featuring 100% Pure Cosmetics. Everything sounds so wonderful… earth based, all 100% natural,fruit pigmented, vegan friendly, no preservatives, no harmful chemicals, fragrance free, full of antioxidants, no animal testing, it is like organic food for your face, etc. etc. I’m wondering what is really in their products???? The Left Brain responds: Good question, Grace. Looking at the ingredients in their products it appears that they do indeed have simplified, formulas that avoid the use of many traditional surfactants, preservatives, thickeners, and fragrances. How do they do this? By providing very basic formulas that rely on naturally-derived functional ingredients surrounded by a lot of non-functional natural ingredients that sound good but don’t really do anything. 100% Pure ingredients For example, here is their ingredient list 100% Pure Organic Lavender Foaming Shower Gel. All Natural Ingredients: Organic Lavender Hydrosol, Organic Lavender Honey, Gentle Coconut Cleanser (coco betaine), Organic extracts of Jasmine, Chamomile, Calendula and Rose, Organic White Tea, Organic Lavender Essential Oil, Vitamin E (a-tocopherol), Vitamin C (ascorbyl palmitate), Natural Food Preservatives from salt and cranberries (less than 0.1% of Sodium Benzoate, Potassium sorbate) They take some liberties with the labeling guidelines and try to hide the ingredients that actually make the product work. If you strip away the nonsense you get… Water, Coco Betaine, Salt, Sodium Benzoate and Potassium Sorbate These ingredients are found in many other products. Coco betaine is chemically derived from coconut oil and is a very close cousin of cocamidopropyl betaine which is found in almost all mass market shampoos and cleanser. While it’s milder than some other foaming agents (like sodium lauryl sulfate) it is also not as effective of a cleanser.) Interestingly, they say their products contain no preservatives but then they have Sodium Benzoate & Potassium Sorbate which are both preservatives. Go figure. The Beauty Brains bottom line I’m sure these are fine products but they aren’t any better for you than the much less expensive products you can buy at your local grocery store. It’s really your choice – if you like these products then buy them. But don’t be tricked into buying them just because 100% Pure tells you they’re more natural. What do YOU think?

Wanting to move away from toxic products, I excitedly bought shampoo and conditioner. The first ingredients sound great…then the list grows with increasingly complex multi-syllable chemical words that I find hard to believe are just plants! Technically I suppose everything on earth comes from ‘nature’ but I was expecting plant extracts ONLY not plant extracts and the same old chemicals. Whats up here? Is it marketing hype? The Left Brain laments: Sandra, I think you guessed it…Aveda is mostly marketing hype. Consider Aveda’s Color Conserve Shampoo Shampoo Ingredients Their ingredient list (as taken from Drugstore.com ) Aqueous Purified Water Extracts: Camellia Sinensis Extract, Citrus Aurantium Amara Peel Extract (Bitter Orange), Astragalus Root (Membranaceus) Extract (Milk Vetch), Schizandra Chinensis Fruit Extract, Pinus Tabulaeformis Bark Extract (Pine), Vitis Vinifera Seed Extract (Grape), Sedum Rosea Root Extract, Rehmannia Chinensis Root Extract, Ammonium Lauryl Sulfate, Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate, Lauramidopropyl Betaine, Cinnamidopropyltrimonium Chloride, Quaternium 80, PEG 7 Dimethicone C8-C18 Ester, Babassuamidopropyl Betaine, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Amyl Salicylate, Amyl Cinnamate, Lycopene, Lecithin, Tetrahexyldecyl Ascorbate, Tocopherol, Sucrose Palmitate, Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Glycol Stearate, Glycol Distearate, Polyglyceryl 10 Oleate, Polyquaternium 7, Fragrance, Cistus Ladaniferus Oil, Glycerin, Citric Acid, Disodium EDTA, Propylparaben, Methylparaben, Methylisothiazolinone, Methylchloroisothiazolinone They actually aren’t following the naming conventions of the INCI Dictionary because the term “Purified Water Extracts” is not an official name. If you strip away from this list all the stuff that is just marketing fluff, you’re left with the following ingredients that actually make the product work. Water, Ammonium Lauryl Sulfate, Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate, Lauramidopropyl Betaine, Cinnamidopropyltrimonium Chloride, Quaternium 80, PEG 7 Dimethicone C8-C18 Ester, Babassuamidopropyl Betaine, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Glycol Stearate, Glycol Distearate, Polyglyceryl 10 Oleate, Polyquaternium 7, Fragrance, Glycerin, Citric Acid, Disodium EDTA, Propylparaben, Methylparaben, Methylisothiazolinone, Methylchloroisothiazolinone You have the same kind of formulas you find in conventional shampoos. That includes water, detergents (ALS, disodium laureth sulfosuccinate, lauramidopropyl betaine), conditioning ingredients (all the ones after betaine up to fragrance), fragrance, adjustment ingredients (to make manufacturing easier), and preservatives (parabens, isothiazolinones). And you’ll find many of these ingredients in store brands like Pantene, Suave, Dove, Fructis, Tresemme, etc. There is nothing particularly natural about Aveda shampoos anyway. They do have a requirement that all the ingredients can be traced back to some plant but ultimately, this is a ruse. The Beauty Brains bottom line: Aveda produces good, high quality products, but they are no more natural or good for you than anything else you can buy. They have some environmental stances that are laudable which may help make you feel better about buying them.

"The Beauty Brains","2015-11-23 13:45:00","Is soft and beautiful relaxer safe for kids? by The Beauty Brains Dallas has a question: What is the pH of Soft and Beautiful texture softener for kids and is it ok to use on my six year old hair which is so hard to manage she is African American 100%. The Left Brain has an answer: The Right Brain has blogged before about the chemistry of relaxers and how they work. They all contain some kind of caustic material that reacts with and reshapes the proteins bonds in your hair. The Soft and Beautiful product is a “no lye” relaxer because it’s based on calcium hydroxide and guanadine carbonate instead of sodium hydroxide. Also, in order to work properly, relaxers must function at a high pH. (Soft and Beautiful has a pH of about 13.) However, the pH is not the critical factor to consider in terms of damage, it’s the concentration of the active ingredients. Because of their reactivity, all relaxers can be dangerous if they are not used properly. But at least the Soft and Beautiful uses a lower active level than a standard relaxer so it has a milder relaxation effect that is designed for softening the texture of children’s hair. Therefore, it should be ok to use on your daughter’s hair as long as you follow the instructions carefully. I can’t emphasize this point enough: if you leave the relaxer on your hair too long, it can cause increased hair breakage and scalp irritation. Write back and let me know how your daughter’s hair turns out. What do YOU think? Does the need to relax children’s hair outweigh the risks of exposing them to potentially dangerous chemicals?

"The Beauty Brains","","Why does murad acne spot treatment contain sulfur? by The Beauty Brains Pas poses this puzzler: I’m currently using Murad’s acne treatment kit and was curious about its use of sulfur, which I have not seen before. How does sulfur help treat acne? The Right Brain unravels the riddle: The Murad line of anti-acne products are proud of the fact that they don’t use benzoyl peroxide, an approved over the counter drug that can be drying to your skin. Instead Dr. Murad formulated his Acne Spot Treatment with sulfur, an approved over the counter drug that can be drying to your skin. Go figure! Why sulfur? Sulfur is a yellow crystalline mineral that has long been used for its medicinal properties. It’s considered an essential element for life because it’s present in two amino acids. Sulfur has been used for a loooooong time to control acne even though we don’t know the exact mechanism that makes it work. It’s suspected that it causes the skin to peel and shed excess cells. Some researchers, according to Skincarephyscians.com, believe that it can actually make acne worse by promoting blackhead and whitehead formation through increased cell adhesion. If you haven’t heard of sulfur in acne products before, that’s probably due to the fact that it’s not commonly used today because it has an unpleasant odor and it can discolor the skin (in addition to being drying.) The Beauty Brains bottom line If you’re sensitive to products that contain benzoyl peroxide and you’re looking for an alternate active ingredient, then Murad Acne Spot Treatment might be a good option for you. But be warned, some of the items in the Murad line are a bit expensive! (See below for some examples.) What do YOU think?

"The Beauty Brains","","You don’t have to use body wash to get yourself clean by The Beauty Brains Valeri is vexed …Body wash can cost $4 or more. Some shampoos cost .66 to .99 cents. Is there that much of a difference between the two products to justify the price? I use the shampoo for body wash. Left Brain’s bubbly reply … Great question Valeri and an astute observation for even considering the possibility. The truth is that shampoos and body washes are so similar that they can be used interchangeably. In fact, in the early days of body washes it was not uncommon for a company to take its shampoo formula , put it in a different bottle, change the label and call it a body wash. Shampoo & Body Wash Similarities Let’s look at some of the things that the two products have in common. 1. Water & detergent . Shampoos and body washes are designed to clean which means they’re mostly water and detergent. And for cleaning oil off of surfaces nothing beats surfactants. Body washes like Dove, Olay and Herbalessences all use Sodium Laureth Sulfate. This is the same surfactant that many shampoos use. 2. Fragrance & Color . No differences here. Body wash and shampoo use the same ingredients to make the product smell good and look pretty. 3. Conditioning ingredients . Since detergents can be a bit harsh, ingredients are added to improve the after-feel of hair and skin. Often body washes and shampoos use the same types of ingredients. Shampoo & Body Wash Differences While shampoos and body washes are quite similar there are some important differences. 1. Body wash uses less harsh detergents . Since skin is generally more sensitive than hair, body wash formulas are made with slightly less detergent and also less harsh detergents. The low cost shampoos use SLS or ALS which are excellent cleaners but can be drying to skin. 2. Different conditioning ingredients . Some of the ingredients that conditioner hair can also provide a nice feel on skin. However, many will not and this is often a key difference between shampoos & body washes. A great comparison is to look at the list of ingredients of the Herbal Essences Body Wash versus their Shampoo . See the similar ingredients? Companies have actually picked up on the similarities. In the Old Spice High Endurance Body Wash they show a guy washing his hair and body with the same product. Beauty Brains Bottom Line Shampoos clean and so do body washes. In general you’ll find it beneficial to use both a body wash and a shampoo. But there is really no reason you couldn’t use a shampoo to clean your entire body. If you use a daily moisturizer, then there is no need for a separate body wash.","You don’t have to use body wash to get yourself clean","27c334f6a491a7d4f7940813cb9d35add4beb3b5","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2008/08/you-dont-have-to-use-body-wash-to-get-yourself-clean/"

The Right Brain makes up a reply: We know you’re making a little joke, CL, but your comment about seeing yourself without makeup reminds me of an interesting study from the Journal of Cosmetic Science. It’s about researchers in France who have studied why women wear makeup. Stimulate yourself According to the article, makeup stimulates three of our senses. First, it stimulates the sense of sight because of the visual impact of the pretty colors we smear all over our eyes, lips, and cheeks. ( Smashbox O-Glow blush is NOT a good example of a pretty blush color!) Second, depending on the kind of makeup, it can also stimulate our sense of smell. While too much fragrance is a turn off I also don’t want a foundation that smells waxy or oily. A little bit of a fresh scent in makeup can be a nice touch. Third, and I’ve never stopped to think about this before, makeup also stimulates our sense of touch. That happens during the application process (Mmmm, the feel of a soft sable brush against my cheek) or long after the product has been applied (my lips still feel plumpy and dewy way after a fresh coat of Boghese Radiant Moisture .) The study also raised the intriguing notion that makeup can stimulate not only our hands and fingers but literally all our body surfaces. (Are you listening Sarah Bellum??) Why women use makeup But the most interesting aspect of this study was the way it tried to understand why we like makeup so much. The researchers say that makeup’s effect on our senses results in two different psychological effects: camouflage and seduction. Camouflage is all about reducing anxiety, supporting our internal defense mechanisms, and helping with emotional stability. Seduction is about being more socially assertive and extroverted. The way you use makeup depends on your individual psychological profile. Here are some sample questions from the researcher’s survey. We think it would be fun if our Beauty Brains community left comments with your answers. Next week we’ll summarize your answers and give the results from the actual study. Warning: this study was originally done in France so there’s a cultural bias and the language on some of the questions doesn’t translate very well. To answer, just leave a comment with the number of the question and one of the following responses (you can copy and paste if you’d like): Strongly Disagree Slightly Disagree Neither Disagree or Agree Slightly Agree Strongly Agree Here are the questions: When I’m made up I feel glamorous With makeup I want to smile. I make myself up in a more intense way in the evening. Without makeup I’m insipid. When I’m made up I want to allure. A woman who does not make herself up is a woman who over rates intellectual dimension to the detriment of appearance. I use makeup to control the image of myself. Without makeup I don’t feel like myself. I don’t like my face without makeup. I always make myself up when I’m going to be in contact with other people Source: “Why Women Wear Makeup: Implication of Psychological Traits in Makeup Functions” (J. Cosmet.

"The Beauty Brains","","Does wearing eye makeup cause styes? by The Beauty Brains Beth inquires: I know this isn’t a question related to a specific product, but I just have to ask. I keep getting a stye in the same spot on my eyelid, and I am scared to go to the doctor because I don’t want them to tell me to stop wearing makeup! I know, that is terrible. But I wash my makeup brushes regularly, I change my mascara every 3 months, I don’t do the same for my eyeshadows or eyeliners, however. I always get all of my makeup off before I go to bed. I am just wondering if there is any evidence of makeup causing styes? It seems strange that it would always be in the same spot if it were something in my makeup, wouldn’t it get on the other eye as well? Thanks for any guidance you can provide, I really love your blog and respect your science. The Right Brain responds: When Beth first posed this question, we urged her to overcome her fear and check with her doctor. That’s because we are cosmetic scientists, NOT medical professionals and we would never want anyone to seek our advice in place of seeking help from their physician. Thankfully Beth took our advice and asked a dermatologist. Even better, she was kind enough to write back and tell us what advice the doctor gave her. So, we thought we’d share her email with the rest of Beauty Brains community in case you ever have similar problems. Here’s what she said: Hi Beauty Brains, I just thought you might like to know, that I did check with my dermatologist. She said some people are just prone to styes, and that it has absolutely nothing to do with makeup or products or anything. It’s just a “shell” that keeps filling and draining. If you really get them a lot, sometimes an ophthalmologist can remove the shell through surgery, but it can cause scarring. Just a hot compress is all you should use. Anyway, thanks for your reply, thought this might help if you get this question again! Thank YOU Beth, for taking your time to share your learnings with the rest of the Beauty Brains community. It’s people like you that make doing this blog worth while. And we’re relieved to hear that you don’t have to worry about giving up your favorite eyeshadow! If you want to learn more, here’s a good article from Medline on the causes of styes . Have you ever had a stye on your eye? Have you ever felt like you’re living in a pig sty ? No? Well, um, have you ever watched a Julia Stiles movie? Close enough!

"The Beauty Brains","","Can you get HIV from a nail salon? by The Beauty Brains Charlotte’s concern: I went with my daughter and had a my first and probably only pedicure. After I had my pedicure I read a article that said you could get HIV from a pedicure. I’m worried. How true is this? The Left Brain’s calming response: While transmission is theoretically possible it is highly unlikely. According to this doctor , there have been no reported cases of HIV, Hepatitus B or C transmission from nail salons. Still, if you’re worried, I think you get tested by your doctor (the Oraquick Advance HIV 1/2 Rapid Test will give you a result in 20 minutes at your doctor’s office. You can take a Hepatitis screening as well.) The real issue here is the cleanliness of your salon. While HIV transmission is not a serious concern, dirty implements and improperly sanitized foot baths can cause a variety of other infections. See our previous post about the danger of infection from pedicures for more details. The Beauty Brains bottom line There’s very little chance you’ve contracted HIV from your pedicure. But if you’re really concerned about taking your daughter to a nail salon, you might consider a Do It Yourself approach. See the links below for some of the basic tools you’ll need.

I was hoping you could share your opinion on this line. The Right Brain replies: Thanks for the reminder on mineral makeup, Nina, we’re still waiting for Mid Brain to finish the report. In fact, we’ve had LOTS of people in the Beauty Brains community ask when it’s going to be ready. Are you listening Mid Brain??? Before we answer your question about Mychelle’s skin care line, here’s bit of background on wrinkles. We’ve blogged before about extreme claims made by expensive wrinkle creams like LA Mer and Dr. Perricone. And we’ve told you about the Consumer Reports study that shows expensive skin moisturizers don’t necessarily work better than cheaper brands . But we haven’t told you what you should know about the real causes of wrinkles. Causes of Wrinkles There’s an wrote an excellent article by Diane Billdeau in the July 2008 issue of Cosmetics & Toiletries that explains the difference between wrinkles caused by your body’s internal aging processes and those caused by external factors like sun. You may be surprised to find that natural aging and photo-aging show up differently on your skin. Here’s the scoop on how these two types of evil aging affect your skin on the outside and what they do to you on the inside. Chronological aging (old age) How it shows up on the outside Increased fine wrinkles Thinner skin Less elasticity Increased dryness Slower scar formation How it affects you on the inside Lowers collagen and elastin levels Slows cell turnover Decreases fibroblasts Photoaging (Sun exposure) How it shows up on the outside Deeper wrinkles Saggy looking skin Irregular pigmentation and brown spots Roughness and leathery appearance How it affects you on the inside Builds up broken elastin fibers Reduces collagen Slows cell turn over Does Mychelle skin care really work? Now let’s get back to your question. Mychelle caught our eye because it contains caprooyl tetrapeptide-3. According to Billdeau’s research, this peptide builds a stronger connection between the dermis and epidermis. Her data shows that creating a stronger bridge between these two skin layers provides significant long term wrinkle. Now, just because Mychelle uses this ingredient doesn’t prove that their products really work any better. You have to be careful because lots of products make claims based on ingredient test data. So, we’re skeptical about Mychelle until we see data on their products. But if you’re interested in trying a new skin care line and you can afford it, click the links below for Mychelle products.

"The Beauty Brains","","What’s the difference between skin toners and astringents? by The Beauty Brains Glitterati gushes: My facialist told me that toners are important because they re-balance the pH of the skin after cleansing. I could see that cleansers might be slightly basic, but will the toner really re-balance that? I like toners anyway for the astringent properties you mention, so I’d continue using them regardless of the pH factor. Oh, and the facialist used a toner from Dermalogica. Would there be a “pH difference” between the pricey stuff and the drugstore brands? Also, what effect, if any, would my residential well water that has a pH of 5.5 have on my skin? The Right Brain Responds: You have a facialist? I’m lucky if I can get someone to cut my hair! But that’s enough commentary on our personal grooming practices; let’s get right to your questions: Toner tips Will a toner really rebalance your skin pH? Well, a skin toner is kind of like your appendix: you have one but your body doesn’t really need to use it. Your skin pH is a result of the skin’s acid mantle, a mixture of sebum (skin oils) and sweat that form on the surface of your skin. This acid mantle keeps the pH of your skin at about 4 to 4.5 (Remember, low pH like 1 to 5 is acidic, high pH 8 or above is basic, and the middle, around 7, is neutral.) Anyway, this slightly acidic pH is a good thing on your skin because it helps ward off harmful bacteria. When you wash your skin, you strip away this acid mantle. That’s because the detergents in cleansers are very good at dissolving oils. But don’t worry, because over the next few hours, your skin will regenerate the mantle by itself. So what about the toner? What does it do? Not much apparently. Check out what Smartskincare.com has to say on the subject: “Toning is often touted as an essential step in a skin care routine. It is not. At least not always. The only exception is very oily skin. If you have oily skin and after cleansing it remains sticky or oily, you might benefit from applying toner after cleansing. Otherwise toning may do more harm than good. Most toners contain alcohol and/or witch hazel. Both are drying and irritating, especially if you have dry or sensitive skin. If you still feel you need a toner, use a soothing toner free of alcohol or witch hazel, such as alcohol-free toner with chamomile. You do not want to strip every last molecule of oil from your skin. Only grime, makeup and excess oil on the surface needs to be removed. The underlying thin coat of fresh sebum is best left undisturbed. Toners, especially alcohol-based ones, tend to strip everything off, leaving the skin dry and/or irritated. Some experts argue that toners help close pores and tighten cell gaps after cleansing, thus reducing the penetration of impurities and environmental contaminants into the skin. Whether this is true is debatable. Even assuming it is, most people finish their skin care routine by applying skin care products with active ingredients, in which case you actually want as much penetration as possible. Preceding an active treatment with a toner that closes pores and tightens cell gaps may be counterproductive. After the active product has absorbed into your skin, you can close pores simply by cooling your face. The cold constricts blood vessels and closes pores, producing a toning effect. You can simply step outside if it is a cold time of the year or gently pat your skin with a cold pack (refrigerated but not frozen) for a few seconds. If you are not using any active products, you can tone after cleansing by wiping your face with a chip of frozen green tea. The cold from the ice helps close your pores; the caffeine and tannins in the tea help tighten skin and reduce puffiness; and green tea polyphenols may provide antioxidant benefits. But don’t overuse the cold – frequent excessive cooling may increase the risk of developing rosacea (stubborn skin redness).” Interesting, eh? Acid mantle You also asked about a pH difference between pricey brands and drugstore brands. Here’s the scoop on that: First of all, the price of the product has no bearing on the pH. There are pH balanced products at all price points. But secondly, and most importantly, pH of the product doesn’t matter all that much. Since your skin regenerates its natural acid mantle after you cleanse, the pH of the product you apply has very little effect. But don’t take our word for it. Check out what Argonne National Laboratory’s “Ask A Scientist” program had to say when asked about the effect of putting different pH solutions on skin : Importance of pH Finally, you asked about the effect of pH in well water. It would have no more effect than tomato juice (fairly acidic at about pH 4) or black coffee ( about pH 5) or urine (about pH 5 to 7). Unpolluted rain has pH of about 6.2. (If the folks over at Neutrogena are reading this, feel free to use this idea for a new line of skin toners: “Now with Tomato Juice, Urine, and Coffee! Coming soon to a drug store near you!” The Beauty Brains bottom line Unless you have very oily skin that needs to be degreased, don’t worry too much about using a pH balanced toner.

"The Beauty Brains","None","Are you bothered by boob sweat? by The Beauty Brains Agent 23 asks: I hate under-boob sweat. It annoys me to no end. Plus it’s not like I can avoid it when I exercise. While sweat from everywhere else on my body evaporates within minutes, underboob sweat just sits there. I know I have the option of showering immediately after working out, but I don’t like using the gym’s shower, and I do like going to a coffee shop to relax by myself after my work out. Soooo, would it be safe to put antiperspirant under my boobs to prevent under-boob sweat? Sarah Bellum says: Despite all my begging and pleading, I can’t get the well endowed Right Brain to answer this question, so you’re stuck with my answer. But don’t worry, I’ll help you find a bit of Ban for your boobs, some Degree for your decollatage, or maybe even a little Arrid for under your areolas. As the Righty previously blogged, antiperspirants really aren’t made to be used all over your body. In this case, I can think of three problems you might have if you put antiperspirant under your boobs. Over heating Antiperspirant stops you from sweating and that means your body can’t cool itself like its supposed to. If you put it all over your body, you might get dangerously over heated. But unless you have HUGE breasts, I doubt this will be a problem. Irritation I know antiperspirants can be irritating sometimes. Not sure how it might feel if some of it got up around the around the tender nippular area, if you catch my drift. Stained clothing You know those yellow stains your shirts get on their armpits? That’s because some aluminum salts used in antiperspirants combine with certain kinds of fabrics. If you get Secret on your Victoria’s Secret, you could ruin a bra. Or get underarm stains on your stomach, if that makes any sense. The Beauty Brains booby…uh, bottom line If you want my official answer, I say that antiperspirants are over the counter drugs that are designed to used only under your arms.

"The Beauty Brains","","3 ways to protect your hair from heat by The Beauty Brains Cristy’s question: Is it beneficial to use a heat protector on my hair when using a hair dryer and flat iron vs not using anything? The Right Brain’s heated reply: Heat protection IS important for your hair, Cristy, because heat is bad for your hair. But that’s not exactly a news flash now is it? You’ve probably read that before on a zillion other beauty blogs. But only the Beauty Brains explain WHY heat is harmful and tell you what to do about it. We’ve blogged before about heat protecting sprays , but here’s some more information for all you “hot heads” out there. How Heat Is Harmful Coming unglued Each strand of your hair is covered with shingle-like structures called cuticles that protect your hair from damage. Cuticles are composed of layers of protein structures called the epicuticle and the exocuticle. You can think of them as tiny protein sandwiches. These protein structures are stuck together with a natural hair “glue” called 18-methyleicosinoic acid (or 18-MEA for short.) Sadly, this “hair glue” can be broken down by heat. (It can also be destroyed by exposure to shampoo and UV radiation.) Without the glue that holds them together, your cuticles become weakened and loose. That means your hair is more likely to be rough and dull and more likely to be damaged by combing and brushing. Super dry = Superbad Heating your hair evaporates the water inside it. In fact, heat styling tools can drive off more water than your hair can reabsorb from the air. (The scientific term for that kind of moisture loss is syneresis. Try using that word the next time you want to impress your stylist.) To recover from syneresis you actually have to resubmerge your hair in water to restore its original moisture level. When the moisture level is low your hair is more brittle and will break and crack more easily. That’s not good! Swelling is not swell Wetting hair and rapidly drying it causes the fibers to swell and then quickly contract. This cycle of swelling and contracting causes the cuticles to lift and buckle and even crack. And cracked cuticles mean rougher feel, loss of shine, and potential breakage. Now that you understand why heat is bad, we’ll tell you what you can do about it. Here are three heat saving tips. 3 Heat Savers 1. Don’t do drying damage To avoid syneresis from heat drying, you can wash and dry your hair less frequently. Since that’s not always practical, when you do blow dry your hair use a diffuser to avoid over heating. 2. Guard the glue To protect your hair from heat, you’ll need all the hair glue that you can keep! And since sunlight degrades hair glue you’d better protect your tresses from UV light. Using products with UV absorbers can help a little bit, but focus on leave in products because rinse out products aren’t very effective at depositing significant amounts of sunscreening agents. Of course, you could always wear a hat. You might also consider sulfate free shampoos that use milder surfactants, like decyl glucose, because they are less likely to dissolve the precious 18-MEA. 3. Be cautious with cuticles Once your cuticles have become loosened, you need to do all you can to prevent further erosion. Good conditioning is the key here – you should never let a comb or brush (or even a towel) touch your hair unitl you’ve put some kind of protective conditioner on it first. Either rinse out or leave in will work, the trick is to find But you have to find one that feels right for your hair type. The Beauty Brains bottom line Any time your hair goes from wet to dry you’re causing some kind of damage. And using heat to make it dry faster only speeds up the damage. Hopefully this article has helped you understand exactly what is happening to your hair and these tips will help you defend your tresses from thermal stresses.

"The Beauty Brains","","How to care for your dry skin and breakouts by The Beauty Brains Olivia Says : My face is starting to look really bad, it’s dry, and I’m breaking out badly on my cheeks and forehead. What type of cleanser should I use? (I’ve heard that plain soap dries out your skin.) Also, what kind of facial mask should I use? The Right Beauty Brain Replies: It sounds like you’ve got combination skin issues; we’ll tackle how to cleanse your dry skin first. For skin like yours, you need to avoid harsh cleansers. While it’s difficult to recommend specific products without more information, we can tell you what to stay away from. Avoid plain soap or products that contain sodium lauryl sulfate or alcohol. These can make your dry skin even drier. Make sure these ingredients are NOT listed on the back of the product before you buy anything. For more help, here’s a great place to learn about proper skin cleansing. Your other problem, breaking out on your cheeks and forehead, is a little bit trickier to handle. We recommend Acnenet for a detailed discussion of options for treating acne. You can read about benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid (the most common tools used in fighting acne), as well as other available therapies including treatment by a dermatologist. We like this site because not only does it tell you what ingredients work, it also tells you what ingredients DON’T work! In answer to your last question about which facial mask to use, we’d say stay away from masks until you get your dry skin under control. Most masks, especially the clay based products, can dry skin out even more which could cause you additional problems. If you feel you must use a mask, look for one that does not contain clay.","How to care for your dry skin and breakouts","f9c78d48076f41512905ec360afb8d9621a9204b","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2008/07/how-to-care-for-your-dry-skin-and-breakouts/"
"Randy Schueller","2016-06-19 19:06:00","The 10 strangest ingredients used in cosmetics by Randy Schueller This article about a cosmetic science program for kids at the Boston Museum of Science reminded me of all the other odd source of raw materials used in cosmetics. So, here are what the Beauty Brains think are some of the strangest ingredients used in cosmetic and personal care products. Top 10 Strange Cosmetic Ingredients 10. Placenta – The life giving uterus lining expelled after birth has been used in some beauty care products for years . Various manufacturers claim it helps stimulate tissue growth, reduces wrinkles and is good for your hair. Unfortunately, none of those claims have ever been proven. 9. Whale vomit – This material called Ambergris is useful as a fixative in perfumes. It has a sweet, earthy odor and is usually found washed up on a beach in South America or Australia. It has mostly been replaced by synthetic alternatives. 8. Cochineal beetles – When you need a nice red color, you can drown a few of these buggers in some hot water, dry them out and pulverize them. The deep crimson dye is versatile enough to be used in skin creams, lipsticks and almost any other beauty product. 7. Waste cooking oil – Scientists say that a surfactant can be made from spent cooking oil that will help regenerate damaged skin. So the next time you order a burger don’t be surprised if you hear “Do you want a facial with that?” 6. Human breast milk – It could be a gimmick but some people swear by using human breast milk to make soap . Is this something you would try? 5. Bird poop – Ever heard of a Geisha Facial ? It features deep cleansing, $180 price tag, and a big scoop of Nightingale bird poop. Supposedly the uric acid is supposed to be great for your face. Perhaps it is but you certainly don’t need to smear bird droppings on yourself to get it. 4. Bull semen – Want shiny hair? Then a few salons in Europe think they have exactly what you need. Protein from bull semen is supposed to give amazing results. I’m skeptical it will give you anything more than a stiff hair cut. 3. Snake venom – One of the most ridiculous new ingredients for keeping wrinkles at bay is snake venom . Cosmetic makers who use this stuff hope that you’ll connect the Botox poison with snake poison and figure both must work wonders on wrinkles. Despite what Jamie Pressly might think, snake venom hasn’t been shown to have any positive improvement in wrinkle creams. 2.

"The Beauty Brains","","A beauty industry secret: Who really makes your cosmetics? by The Beauty Brains Karen’s concern: I always understood that among the cosmetic brands that there are sister companies like L’Oreal is made by Lancome, etc. If this is true, how does the quality/effectiveness of the drug store brand compare to the more pricey department store brand? While we’re at it: Are the drug store brands, including house brands, made by bigger name companies to make more efficient use of the factory? The Right Brain’s response: You’re close Karen, but you’ve got it a little bit backwards. It’s actually cosmetic giant L’Oreal that makes Lancome. But don’t feel bad, it’s easy to get confused when figuring out who makes what. Who’s who We’ve blogged before about who’s who in the beauty biz . Monster companies like L’Oreal, Unilever, and P&G own many smaller companies and even more brands so it’s hard to tell who your products are coming from. For example, L’Oreal makes the L’Oreal brands like Vives, Preference Hair Color, and Studio Line. They also make other mass market brands like Garnier (Fructis) and Softsheen (ethnic hair care aka Carson Products). They also make several salon/department store brands such as Kerastase, Kiehl’s, Lancome, Matrix, and Redken. Twisted sister Does that mean all these “sister” companies sell the same products? Sometimes yet, sometimes no. There are plenty of differences across the L’Oreal brands but there are some sneaky similarities too. Take a look at the ingredients in Loreal’s Kerastase Nutritive Oleo-Relax Smoothing Hair Masque and L’Oreal Vive Pro Smooth Intense Conditioning Treatment and you’ll see they are are almost EXACTLY. For more details read our post on How Kerastase Kills Your Cash . Doin’ drugs As far as drug store brands and house brands are concenred, that’s a different story. Drug store brands are made by all kinds of different companies like those listed above as well as small “mom and pop” companies. House brands (also called Private Label or generic brands) are made by contract manufacturers. These are companies that specialize in making product for OTHER companies. There are good and bad products from all companies so you can’t over generalize, but products from contract manufacturers don’t always go through the same rigorous testing as products from those companies that make their own. So, be careful when experimenting with house brands. What do YOU think? Do you stick to the big name brands or do you go for house brands?

"The Beauty Brains","","Atopiclair: a miracle cure for itchy skin? by The Beauty Brains Kalli’s question: I have atopic dermatitis since I was 13. I usually just use a hydrocortisone cream to clear it up. I went to a new dermatologist yesterday and he also prescribed a moisturiser also (Atopiclair). What’s the difference between this cream and other creams on the market that target sensitive/atopic skin types (such as Avene, Aderma, Aveeno etc) Thank you!! The Right Brain is itching to respond: Very interesting question! At first we assumed that Atopiclair was different from the other products you asked about because it contains a prescription drug. But that’s not quite true.. What is Atopiclair? Atopiclair is a cream that’s based on hyaluronic acid, telmesteine, Vitis vinifera, and glycyrrhetinic acid. However, none of these ingredients are drugs. In fact, there are no drug actives in Atopiclair at all. So why the need for a prescription? Because it’s classified as a medical device. That means that technically this product is considered to be some kind of medical dressing rather than a drug. Interesting, eh? Does Atopiclair really work? According to the European Journal of Dermatology: A 5-week study in 30 adult patients with mild to moderate AD showed that MAS063D offered significant benefits over a vehicle-only control MAS063D improved the total body area affected (17.2% to 13.2%, p<.001), itch score (2.7 to 1.3 on a 10-point scale, p=.001) and EASI score (28.3 to 24.3, p=.024) after 22 days treatment compared to baseline. The patients’ opinion of Atopiclair (patients’ view of itch control, and view of study substance) was rated by participating patients as significantly better than control (p=.008, p=.042, respectively). Based on these preliminary results in a small scale study, it is suggested that Atopiclair is a possible new treatment option for improving signs and symptoms in adults with mild to moderate AD. (3) No peer-reviewed American studies have been published yet on Atopiclair. Atopiclair has no medically active ingredients–it was approved as a “medical device,” not a medication. Its ultimate utility has yet to be established. However, as large molecules such as those contained in Atopiclair can complex with large amounts of water, it should be able to effectively moisturize the skin or at the very least act as a medical wet dressing The Beauty Brains bottom line There appears to be enough evidence to suggest that Atopiclair is effective enough to be considered an option to treat your AD. The other products you asked about are cosmetics and have no medical test data at all so we doubt you’ll ever see side by side studies. If you want to learn more, you may want to check out this thread. What do YOU think? Does anyone out there suffer from AD? What’s worked for you?

"The Beauty Brains","","Is there an alternative to skinceuticals products? by The Beauty Brains D asks… As part of an anti-acne regimen, both my dermatologist and aesthetician recommended I start using the SkinCeuticals spray toner and Hydratin B5 Gel. I’m getting great results, but am not thrilled with the price of the moisturizer. Yes, it is concentrated and lasts a long time, but at $45/oz on eBay, it’s an awful lot of money. Is there a cheaper alternative with the same active ingredients? Right Brain is ruffled: We get concerned when dermatologists start recommending products. It is not because they don’t know what they are talking about when it comes to skin care, they do. It’s just that saving you money is rarely their concern. They would happily recommend an expensive toner when a less expensive one will work just as well. Add to this that many dermatologists get commissions off the products they recommend and it’s hard not to be cynical. But you can’t blame dermatologists. They may know what ingredients are good for skin, but they can’t know all the products containing said ingredient. Thankfully, you have the Beauty Brains . SkinCeuticals Toner SkinCeuticals Toner is a great example of the inadequacy of the dermatologist’s knowledge on products. Here are the ingredients. Water, Vaccinium Myrtillus (Billberry) Extract, Saccharum Officinarum (Sugar Cane) Extract, Acer Saccharum (Sugar Maple) Extract, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Fruit Extract, Citrus Medica Limonum (Lemon) Extract, Glycerin, Propylene Glycol, Calendula Officinalis (Calendula Extract), Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Extract, Thymus Vulgaris (Thyme) Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Extract, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel), Glycerin, Allantoin, Panthenol, Isoceteth-20, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin, Methylparaben, Benzoic Acid, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Oil If you ignore all the “fluff” ingredients which don’t do anything, you’re left with Water, Glycerin, Propylene Glycol, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel), Isoceteth-20, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin, Methylparaben, Benzoic Acid, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Oil And if you toss out the ingredients that are just preservatives, odor modifiers and solubilizers, you’re left with Water, Glycerin, Propylene Glycol, and Witch Hazel You certainly don’t need to spend >$25 for SkinCeuticals Toner . You can get a much more reasonable and equivalent product like this Nivea Visage Alcohol-Free Moisturizing Toner . Neither product is crucial for your skin routine if you’re using a good cleanser and a moisturizer. But if you like toners, you will probably be happy with the Nivea or some other store brand product. Just look for the ingredients Water and Glycerin. SkinCeuticals Moisturizer Oh my! $62 for 30 mL of product. Sigh… Here are the ingredients Water, Sodium Hyaluronate, Pantothenic Acid, Phenoxyethanol This is truly a ridiculous waste of money. There is no evidence that topical use of Sodium Hyaluronate or Hyaluronic Acid will have any amazing moisturizing effect on your skin. No doubt it’s a good moisturizing ingredient. But there are much better products you could be using (and less expensive)! We could be mistaken, but could find no peer reviewed study that demonstrates topical treatment of skin with Sodium Hyaluronate has any incredible benefit. (Ask your dermatologist if she could direct you to any). But if you want to get an alternative, consider this Hydrating B5 Serum . It’s only $20 for the same amount. We should point out that no big name skin care brand including Olay, Aveeno, or Neutrogena contain products like these. Since these companies employ the best skin scientists in the world, it’s likely that formulas like this don’t provide the best benefits. Beauty Brains bottom line: You don’t have to pay a lot for your non-prescription skin care products, even if it is your dermatologist telling you to do it. Just look at the first few ingredients and find a product that uses some of the same things. We would steer you towards big brands like Olay, Aveeno & Neutrogena since these are created by the highest paid, best cosmetic chemists in the industry. They also have the most rigorous testing to prove their products work.","Is there an alternative to skinceuticals products?","9d9f049b0f326d71f65e7721053b1baa235626ea","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2008/11/is-there-an-alternative-to-skinceuticals-products/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Pantene is bad for hair myth busted by The Beauty Brains Right Brain retorts: On several occasions we’ve blogged about how many people believe Pantene is bad for your hair. It looks like the marketers at P&G (the makers of Pantene) are paying attention to blogs like the Beauty Brains because their Public Relations agency has just sent out this press release on that very question. Here’s what they had to say: MYTH: PANTENE PRO-V LEAVES BEHIND A LAYER OF WAX ON YOUR HAIR AND CREATES A WAXY BUILD-UP OVER TIME. FACTS: Pantene Shampoos and Conditioners do not contain wax. Although Pantene has unique and proprietary ingredients based on recent technological advances, the classes of ingredients (silicones, fatty alcohols, cationic polymers and cationic surfactants) are used consistently across the hair care industry. Pantene Shampoo and Conditioners do leave behind conditioning ingredients (such as coacervate conditioning complexes, liquid crystals, and terminal amino silicones) for healthy hair benefits such as moisturization, damage protection and shine. Pantene shampoos and conditioners are designed to work together, depositing conditioning ingredients that will wash out of the hair with the next shampoo. When women feel they have build-up from their shampoos and conditioners, it is often a sign that the products they are using are too heavy for their hair, and they may be more satisfied with a lower conditioning version. PS – Want to get technical? Let us know and we’ll provide additional information and/or set-up a conversation with one of our science experts. While we don’t normally blog about all the self-serving press releases we get, this one caught our attention for a couple of reasons. First, as we said above, it makes us wonder if P&G are reading our blog. (If you are, say hi to your new spokeperson Stacy London for us. We just adore her!) Second, it’s interesting that the official statement from the company uses the same basic scientific rationale that we used in our previous answers to the Pantene plastic myth. And third, and perhaps most important, we like that Pantene is asking you to “get technical” and ask them questions for their scientific experts. Now, that doesn’t mean we believe everything that the big beauty companies say, but we do think that any company that is trying to open a dialog between its customers and their science experts is doing the right thing. You don’t see that from most of the smaller companies that are making outrageous claims that aren’t backed by solid science. So, we say take them up on their challenge. Send Pantene your questions about how their products work and then share what you find out with the rest of the Beauty Brains community.","Pantene is bad for hair myth busted","132c551f6e7baf8d0d4765172d1d24f334056cd0","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2009/01/pantene-is-bad-for-hair-myth-busted/"
"The Beauty Brains","","Does nail polish go bad? by The Beauty Brains Patricia’s puzzled about polish: Does nail polish go bad or can it become contaminated? For example, you paint your nails once or twice and then don’t use it for a couple of years because you misplaced it, is it still safe? The Right Brain nails the right answer: If you’re looking for an excuse to splurge on a new bottle of OPI, we could tell you that you have to throw your old nail polish away after 6 months because it’ll spoil like a bottle milk on a hot summer day. But if you want to know the truth, we have to tell you that nail polish doesn’t really go bad. Bacteria Unlike water based cosmetics which are breeding grounds for bacteria, nail polish is pretty much self-preserving because of all the solvents it contains. (Not much grows in a ethyl acetate cocktail!) Just look at the major ingredients in an OPI nail polish: Butyl Acetate, Toluene, Nitrocellulose, Ethyl Acetate, Tosylamide/Formaldehyde Resin, Dibutyl Phthalate, and Isopropyl Alcohol. Nothing’s gonna grow in THAT chemical cocktail. You could say that nail polish is preservative free! Dry Solvent evaporation Of course just because it won’t grow bacteria doesn’t mean it can’t dry out. If you didn’t screw the cap on nice and tight before you lost the bottle two years ago, you can pretty much kiss your polish goodbye. Because those same solvents that won’t grow bugs will do something else: evaporate! And once nail polish dries out there’s not much that can be done to save it. The Beauty Brains bottom line While your polish may dry out quickly if you leave the cap off, you don’t have much to fear in terms of it spoiling because of old age. In fact, scientists predict that Hostess Twinkies and OPI nail polish will be the only things to survive a nuclear explosion. Oh wait a minute, that’s cockroaches. Well, never mind, you get the idea. And if you’re wondering about your other beauty products you might want to read our previous post on 4 Ways To Tell If Your Cosmetic Has Expired .

"Perry Romanowski","None","4 Dangers of Acrylic Nails by Perry Romanowski Kay’s curious… What are the dangers of using acrylic and tips? The Beauty Brains respond: The good news is, overall, it’s pretty uncommon for acrylic nails to cause significant health problems. Of course, that’s assuming that the technicians are careful and have properly sterilized their instruments. Nonetheless, there’s still cause for concern. From Dermatology Times, here are four dangers of acrylic nails: 1. Nasty nail abuse Mistreating your artificial nails can have serious consequences. It’s particularly bad to make the mistake of using your nails as a tool. According to Zoe Draelos, M.D., a High Point, N.C., dermatologist “Some of those nail sculptures are so rigid that a lot of people will use them, for instance, to clean things or as some type of screwdriver. The problem, says Dr Draelos, is that “the bond between the artificial nail and the real nail is stronger than the bond between the real nail and the nail bed, so it rips the nail from the nail bed, and that creates a space for which infection can occur.” 2. Chemical calamity Chemical allergens used in acrylic nails and nail polishes can also cause problems. The top offenders: formaldehyde (which is used to crosslink polymers), methyl methacrylate (the resin that make up the bulk of the nail); and the tiny metal balls in the bottom of your bottle of nail polish. (That’s because the balls can contain traces of nickel, a known allergen. 3. Cursed UV cure Gel-sculptured nails (the kind that requires curing with a UV light) can be problematic for people who are on photosensitizing medications. Dr. Draelos warns that “if a customer is taking something like tetracycline, which can sensitize them to light, there could potentially be a phototoxic reaction in the nail bed if the sculptured nails are cured under a bright light.” 4. Perilous polish removal Nail polish removers can be damaging to (real and artificial!) because of their drying effect. Once the nail is dried out it can easily peel and crack. Dr. Draelos recommends using nail polish remover only every other week – which means you should do a good job of applying polish so it lasts. Source: Dermatology Times What do you think?

"Randy Schueller","2015-04-26 08:10:00","How to get rid of hard water on hair by Randy Schueller Georgia asks… I have hard water where I live. Should I be using a chelating shampoo to remove mineral build-up? If so, should I use it every time I shampoo, every other time, etc. I color my hair and it is normal to dry. The Beauty Brains respond Back when people used soap-based cleansers for their hair, hard water was a serious problem because soaps react with minerals to form an insoluble salts that build up on hair. Fortunately, the surfactants used in modern shampoos don’t cause this problem. Still, if your water is very hard you may get some mineral deposits from the residual rinse water drying in your hair. If you don’t notice this buildup then you probably don’t need to use a special shampoo. If you do notice your hair looking dull, shifting color, or feeling raspy then then using a chelating shampoo is not a bad idea on occasion. It’s unlikely that you’d need to use it everyday. When shopping for a chelating shampoo look for “EDTA” on the label. That stands for Ethylene Diamine Tetra Acetate and it’s the ingredient that complexes with the minerals in the water and helps them rinse away. There are many shampoos that use EDTA at very low levels as part of their preservative so you should look for a shampoo designed specifically for chelating that uses higher levels of this ingredient. If you’re shopping for a chelating shampoo to get rid of hard water on hair, you can support the Beauty Brains by buying through this link.","How to get rid of hard water on hair","59cf72afb4eee295d368f88236e4f43532cd1192","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2015/04/how-to-get-rid-of-hard-water-on-hair/"
"Randy Schueller","2015-04-26 08:12:00","What does face spray do for your skin? by Randy Schueller Beyond35 asks… What’s the difference between a floral water and facial mist? The owner told me it [Wild Olive] was an infused water…I’m confused. The Beauty Brains respond I looked at this Wild Olive product. “Floral water” and “facial mist” are not technical terms but rather just marketing descriptions so there is no set meaning. A floral water could be an ingredient in a facial mist. Another question is, what’s the deal with these facial sprays? Why lotions are better than face sprays The product in question is Wild Olive Face Mist. According to their website this “product is an enriched water designed to help maintain good hydration levels in the deeper tissue of our skin.” The ingredients, referenced on the website, are basically water, a small amount of natural oils, glycerine, fragrance, glycerine, and a solubolizer (polysorbate-20) to help mix in the oils. I’m a bit surprised to see that there’s no preservative listed. Spraying a water and oil mixture such as this one on your face will provide temporary hydration. I’m sure it feels quite nice if your skin is really dry. But, this type of product can’t deliver the same kind of long lasting moisturization that a cream or lotion can provide. That’s because a moisturizer needs to be applied in a uniform layer across the skin so it can lock in moisture. (Moisturizers work by preventing water from evaporating through the skin. This is called Trans Epidermal Water Loss or TEWL.) A spray like this will not uniformly coat your face and so it won’t reduce TEWL like a lotion will. Also, since this is a spray it consists of mainly water rather than the kinds of oils and waxes that really lock moisture in skin. If you’re just looking for a fresh feeling and you have $20 bucks to spend, then this is the product for you. But if you truly want to deeply moisturize your face then you need a good facial cream.

"Perry Romanowski","2015-06-23 06:24:00","What’s the right order to apply a BHA serum? by Perry Romanowski Little Rhino asks… I would like to add a B5 Serum into my skincare routine. I use a BHA ( salycic acid 2% ) lotion in the am/pm. I works well with my skin and mild acne. However, I do need a little extra boost of hydration. So the B5 sounded like a great place to start. Can these two products work together. If yes, serum first-then lotion or vice versa? The Beauty Brains respond Lil’ Rhino’s question is really a “two-for-one.” Let’s break it apart and try to answer them one at a time. What’s the right order to apply products? The quick answer is that you should apply the BHA product directly to your skin first so nothing interferes with its exfoliating action. Ideally you should let it work for 2 to 5 minutes before applying any other product. Is Vitamin B5 good for skin? Ok, now that we know to apply moisturizer after a BHA treatment we need to find out if vitamin B5 is worth using as a moisturizer. (Note: For the sake of accuracy we need to point out that Vitamin B5 is pantothenic acid. Panthenol, which is typically used in cosmetic products, is the alcohol version of B5. So it’s chemically close but strictly speaking it’s not the same. Okay, now back to the answer…) To be honest, the answer to this one surprised us a bit. As a whole, the use of vitamins is over-rated in skin care and we didn’t expect to find that the B5 provided any specific benefit when applied topically. Surely any moisturizing effect is the result of the other ingredients in the formula and not the vitamin itself, right? Wrong! At least according to one study which showed that lotions with panthenol helps skin retain moisture. The researchers tested three versions of a moisturizing cream formula: a control version without panthenol and versions containing 1% and 5%. Their results showed that after using the creams for 30 days, both of the panthenol-containing versions reduced moisturize loss through the skin better than the control. What does this mean? We don’t think this means you need to run out and spend a lot of money on a Vitamin B5 lotion because this study wasn’t designed to show that it works better than other, less expensive, ingredients. It just shows that B5 does provide protection against moisture loss. Should you buy a B5 cream? IF you know the product contains at least 1% panthenol and IF that product is not too expensive, then it could be worth a try. Just be sure to use if AFTER your BHA treatment.

It works, but it feels just like hair spray, looks just like hair spray, and makes your hair sticky like hair spray. Might it actually be hair spray? And if so, can I use just any type of hair spray for this purpose, or this one is actually better than a normal one if it’s used during blow drying? The Beauty Brains respond As Dafne pointed out in her original question in our Forum, the product contains the following ingredients: Alcohol Denat., Aqua, PVP, VP/VA Copolymer, VP/DMAPA Acrylates Copolymer, PEG- 75 Lanolin, Polysorbate 20, Parfum, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Citronellol, Linalool. (BTW, we LOVE when our readers do their own ingredient research!) Blow dry lotion = hairspray At its core, this is certainly a hairspray. The main ingredients, PVP, VP/VA Copolymer, and VP/DMAPA Acrylates Copolymer, are all hairspray ingredients used to hold the hair in place. But this is a hairspray that’s designed to be used during blow drying. It’s tough to say without seeing the concentration of each ingredient but it’s likely that that the water and alcohol levels (as well as the resins themselves) have been optimized to give you more “play time” during blow drying. You could certainly TRY any old hairspray and see if it works for you but you may find that regular hairspray dries to fast for this kind of application. The worst that can happen is that your hair will end up a tangled mess.

"Randy Schueller","","Can emulsifying agents wear away fat? by Randy Schueller Taffi asks… Polyethylene glycol is listed as an ingredient in my vitamin. Does this mean it is pegylated? are pegylated ingredients harmful when ingested? I know ethoxylates can be toxic, but that might be minute exposure. Also, can emulsifying agents wear away fats/water from the body? The Beauty Brains respond I think this Wikipedia article on ethoxylation does a nice job of addressing your questions your first question. The bottom line is these materials are not toxic. The potential danger of ethoxylated materials comes from contamination with a chemical called 1,4 dioxane. Most companies ensure their surfactants contain levels of 1,4 dioxane that are below the legal limit. Will emulsifiers “wear away” fat when you ingest them? No, for emulsifiers to work they must come into direct contact with the fat globules and surround them so they can be suspended in water. This surfactant-coated fat glob is called a “micelle.” When you ingest emulsifiers they break down so they do not reach body fat the same way they reach fats and oils when mixed into products.

"Randy Schueller","None","How can I tell if my shampoo is really natural? by Randy Schueller Uma asks… I actually bought a Rustic Art shampoo that claims to be all natural , does not test on animals , is pH balanced, no sulphates, great for the environment and all those good things. I was skeptical as I thought since its so good it wont lather and might just clean my hair and wont be like using silicones and stuff…I didn’t mind as I wanted a natural shampoo.

Also my hair felt real soft by the end of the wash which I never felt from other shampoos till I used a conditioner…I am really hooked to this and now I am skeptical if this is really using all natural ingredients….sorry I am being skeptical but your inputs would help! I probably should just be happy with the find and stay quiet. The Beauty Brains respond No need to apologize, Uma, we’re all about healthy skepticism here at the Beauty Brains! The trouble with answering a question such as this one, though, is that there is no standard definition of a natural for beauty products. But we’ll see what we can do based on looking at the ingredients. Rustic Art shampoo ingredients Demineralized water, Cocamidopropyl Betaine (coconut oil extract), Ascorbic acid, Disodium cocoamphodiacetate, Hydrolised Wheat protein, Aloe Vera Juice, Sodium Cocoyl (?) essential oil Blend/Herbal oil blend, and AOS, a plant derivative used as surfactant.

To make our point of how confusing the question of “natural” is, let’s look at this through the lens of two different definitions and see how the answer changes. Definition #1: A product is “all natural” if all ingredients are from renewable, non-petroleum resources. Through this lens this product would be rated very natural because all of the ingredients can be derived from non-petroleum sources. For example the surfactants are coconut-based can be derived from coconut oil. Ascorbic acid can be derived from fruit. The wheat derivative obviously comes from wheat, and so on. Based on this definition this product does seem “all natural.” So, if you like the answer from this definition, you should just stop reading here. Definition # 2: A product is “all natural” if all ingredients are from renewable, non-petroleum resources AND all chemicals used in the processing of the main ingredients follow the same rule. Hmmm. This is where it gets tricky. Let’s look at the main ingredient in the formula, cocoamidopropyl betaine (CAPB) as an example. While coconut oil is a nice natural source for the backbone of this ingredient, several “non-natural” chemicals like chloroacetic acid must be used to transform the nutty oil into CAPB. So you see, you kind of jump down the rabbit hole when trying to pin down the definition of natural. Is it okay if there is only one non-natural ingredient is used to form the product? What about two or three ingredients? What if one of those “unnatural ingredients” is very toxic or damaging to the environment – does that count against the natural-ness of the product? Or does it not matter since the backbone is coconut oil? There is no single right answer for these questions so everyone is left to fend for themselves when it comes to natural definitions. Therefore, using Definition #2 one would be hard-pressed to describe this product as all natural. It gets even more complicated when you start to layer in other factors such as animal testing, biodegradability of ingredients, waste water management, sustainability (remember palm oil) and so on. So now you see how this works. Depending on the parameters of your natural definition you can declare that everything is all natural, nothing is all natural, or it’s somewhere in between. The Beauty Brains bottom line Is this product all natural? If you’re cool with Definition #1 and you like the way this makes your hair feel, then I’d say yes.

"Randy Schueller","2014-03-10 08:20:00","Vintage cosmetic video – how does bath oil work by Randy Schueller If you can get past the horrific 1950s stereotyping, this commerical can teach you something about bath product chemistry. The commercial features a demonstration of how regular bath oil just floats on the surface of the water while Softique bath oil magically “swirls” into the tub. As you might have guessed Softique has a special added ingredient that allows the oil to mix with water. That ingredient is a surfactant, a kind of detergent. But if Softique contains detergent then why doesn’t it foam up? That’s because the type of surfactant they’re using is called a non-ionic and it’s designed to NOT generate foam. Most surfactants that you’re familiar with are the anionic type which are made to create a rich lather. But non-ioinics are useful in this kind of product where you want to combine and an oil and water but you don’t want bubbles.","Vintage cosmetic video – how does bath oil work","bd0a96fa002c8726675a5c442163a2f234056745","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2013/11/vintage-cosmetic-video-how-does-bath-oil-work/"

"Perry Romanowski","","Is red sandalwood an effective sunscreen? by Perry Romanowski Firoza asks… I often find producers of “herbal” or “ayurvedic” cosmetics selling sunscreens containing red sandalwood as the active ingredient. They rate these sunscreens as SPF 50 or higher. Does red sandalwood actually have any sun blocking properties? The Beauty Brains respond Red Sandalwood may have certain medicinal properties when applied topically (see link ) but it is not approved for use as a sunscreen. Any products using this as the “active” sunscreen ingredient would be illegal drugs in the U.S. (and several other countries.) Red Sandalwood + Sunscreen I did a quick check on this ingredient and found that it’s used in a brand called Biotique . I couldn’t find a complete ingredient list for this product but I did find this statement on a website selling the product: “This nutrient-rich cream is blended with pure sandalwood, saffron, wheat germ, honey and bark of the arjun tree to keep skin soft, fair and moisturized. Protects skin with broad spectrum SPF 50 UVA/UVB sunscreen. Very water resistant, retains SPF after 80 minutes in the water.” So, it looks like the product contains red sandalwood but actually protects skin using a broad spectrum SPF 50 UVA/UVB sunscreen. I think this is a classic case of the company implying that the product works because of the natural ingredient but it actually contains chemical sunscreens like most other products. If anyone can find a complete list of ingredients for this, or similar, products let me know and I’ll review it to determine exactly what chemical is providing the sunscreen efficacy.","Is red sandalwood an effective sunscreen?","c4e383d5a6e87daf53053094668df2f86a4f6174","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2015/05/is-red-sandalwood-an-effective-sunscreen/"
"Randy Schueller","2017-01-03 08:07:00","Is it okay to use soap on hair? by Randy Schueller Bunny Lake asks… Chagrin Valley Shampoo Bars are really popular with a lot of the people on the Long Hair Community, and I’ve been trying some sample bars out myself. I love some, but others give me that waxy feeling. I have soft water where I live, also. Is Chagrin Valley Soap the kind of “soap” that is actually NOT good for your hair and skin? A lot of their complexion and body bars contain coconut oil which I have heard is good for hair but highly comedogenic (pore clogging). Thanks for any information you can give me! The Beauty Brains reply It sounds like you’re already savvy to the main problem with washing your hair with bar soap: build up from hard water. Is soap safe for hair? This is what happens when the fatty acid salt that makes up soap reacts with the counter ions in hard water (like magnesium and calcium) to form an insoluble residue. This residue used to be known as “bathtub ring” because of the film left in the tub after bathing. Modern surfactants have eliminated this problem because they don’t react with hard water ions. Similarly, using softened water (as you are) also reduces the problem. Therefore, there’s no technical reason for not using Chagrin Valley Shampoo bars on your hair. Does coconut oil clog pores? Should you worry about coconut oil soap clogging your pores and giving you blackheads? It’s true that coconut oil is highly comedogenic. It’s usually rated a four or five on a five-point scale. This means it’s likely to contribute to pore clogging and acne. However in this case the risk is much lower. That’s because most of the oil in the soap has been reacted. Any residual oil will for the most part be rinsed out of your hair. If you were applying pure coconut oil to your skin there would be more chance of pore clogging than if you’re just using coconut oil soap. Still, there is some risk and you won’t know for sure until you try it.

"Perry Romanowski","2015-08-07 08:47:00","I’m confused about alcohol in cosmetics by Perry Romanowski SkinBiz says: I am a little confused re. the use of alcohol in skincare products, can anyone help me with which ones are not good for the skin and which ones are beneficial? Also what does it mean when a product range is certified halal? The Beauty Brains respond: Alcohol in cosmetics There are two kinds of alcohol used in cosmetics that can be drying to skin: Ethyl alcohol (also listed as Ethanol, Alcohol Denat or SD Alcohol) Isopropyl alcohol (also listed as isopropanol) These are drying to skin because they are short chain alcohols (very few carbon atoms in their backbone) which means they are liquids and can act as solvents. They can dissolve the natural protective oils in your skin. Other kinds of alcohols can actually be good for your skin because they are long chain fatty alcohols which means they act like an oily moisturizer. The most common ones include: Cetyl Alcohol Stearyl Alcohol Halal cosmetics Essentially “halal” means the product is lawful according to The Islamic Food and Nutriition Council. In the case of foods you must avoid the following: Pork and pork by-products. Improper slaughter techniques for animals. Ingredients made from carnivorous animals. Intoxicants like alcohol.

"Randy Schueller","","Does the bird poop facial really work? by Randy Schueller MG must know… A couple of years ago I heard a lot of buzz about the Geisha Facial that uses bird poo to improve your complexion. What’s the science behind this? We know that a lot of beauty claims are bullish*t, but this one is literally birdsh*t! Nonetheless, that hasn’t stopped modern spas from adopting this ancient Japanese tradition. Shizuka New York, for example, charges you $180 for the privilege of having bird poop rubbed on your face. Supposedly, the poo brightens skin and evens out your complexion. Does it really work? Here’s the scientific scoop on bird poop. How a bird poop facial is made First, you get some nightingales (specifically Japanese bush warblers). Why nightingales and not other birds, you ask? Because they have a short digestive tract, which allegedly allows their poop to maintain more of the chemicals that are good for your skin. Then you feed the birds a special diet of organic seeds. The seeds work their way through the birds, and what comes out the other end is called “uguisu no fun” in Japanese. Yes, that’s right. The actual Japanese expression for nightingale crap that you rub all over your face includes the words “no fun.” Ironic, ain’t it? Next, the poop is scraped from the cages (and you thought YOU had a crappy job) and then sanitized with an ultraviolet light before being dried and ground into a fine white powder. This powder is reconstituted and used as a facial cream. What does bird poop do for your skin? Supposedly, bird poop contains a high concentration of urea and guanine. Urea is one of the components of the skin’s Natural Moisturizing Factor (NMF for short), and it’s added to a number of skin creams to improve moisturization. It really works, but you certainly don’t need bird poop to get a good dose of urea! Plus, urea has to be left on the skin to provide a moisturization benefit. Leaving it for a little while and then washing it off does no good. Guanine is a naturally iridescent material that can make you look sparkly. But, again, it only works when left on your face. It doesn’t have any lightening or brightening properties other than being glittery. At least one source claims that uguisu no fun contains an enzyme that lightens skin. But we could find no evidence of this at all. Most sites report that guanine is an enzyme, which it’s not. Historically, Geishas used bird poop to bleach stains from their kimonos. This makes sense, since the bird droppings could have a high pH due to ammonia, which could lighten the kinds of pigments used as fabric dyes. It won’t, however, remove melanin, which is the pigment in skin that gives it its color. The Beauty Brains bottom line Instead of wasting your money on a bird poop facial, buy a good moisturizer with urea. And if you want to get rid of acne scars or dark spots, use retinol or a skin lightener that’s proven to work.","Does the bird poop facial really work?","5d05d9731a32d0bdd86fafde8934ee7a5133392a","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2013/11/does-the-bird-poop-facial-really-work/"
"Randy Schueller","None","Is Refinery29 right about the worst things you do to damage your hair? by Randy Schueller A recent post on one of our favorite beauty and fashion sites, Refinery29, listed the top 7 worst things you do to damage your hair . Let’s review their list to see if they’re based on beauty science. 1. Neglecting nourishment The article says that not taking care of yourself can lead to weaker hair. It’s certainly true to some extent but studies have shown you have to be quite malnourished before that takes a toll on your hair. Still it’s hard to disagree with advice “you should take care of yourself.” 2. Tearing it up with your towel This one is certainly true – the fiber to fiber friction caused by rough towel drying is very damaging to the cuticle. And once you lose a few layers of cuticle your hair will break much more easily. 3. Battling with your brush It’s also true that brushing and combing can damage hair. As the article points out this is especially true when hair is wet. (Wet hair her will stretch farther but it will actually take less force to break.) 4. Blasting with your blow dryer. The article claims that when you excessively blow dry your hair you pull out “intrinsic moisture” which damages your hair even more. (It’s also true that the heat can cause some structural disruption to the proteins in your hair.) Surprisingly though, here’s an article that talks about why air drying may be more damaging to your hair than blow drying! 5. Skipping shampoo Not washing your hair often enough is one of the worst things you can do? This one is mystifying to us. Refinery29 says two things that are scientifically questionable: The first is that oil on your skin (or in this case on your scalp) does not provide hydration. That’s not really the case because oils do a great job of moisturizing by preventing water from evaporating from the deeper layers of skin. (This is called trans epidermal water loss.) The second questionable statement is that if you don’t wash your hair the bad bacteria will grow out of control and cause itching and dryness. If you’re talking about microorganism-induced itching and dryness then you’re talking about some form of dandruff which is caused by the yeast Malassezia not bacteria. But if you don’t have dandruff you won’t develop the condition just because you don’t wash your hair. And if you DO have dandruff regular shampooing may not solve the problem; you need an active ingredient calm the flaking and itching. 6. Agonizing with accessories The article states that you should be careful when using pins and elastic bands on wet hair. We agreed since, as noted above, wet hair is more susceptible to breakage. Anything you do to wet hair, whether it be brushing, adding hair extensions, or using pins and elastic, can cause more damage. 7. Causing cumulative damage Refinery29 says that you should give your hair a break from constant stress of styling. In other words, this one is essentially the same as items 2, 3, and 4 above. What’s missing? Amazingly the article makes no mention of the two or three things that more damage to your hair than ANYTHING else on this list. Chemical processes like relaxing, perming, straightening, coloring, and highlighting all intensely and irreversibly damage your hair. These are the worst of the worst! And if we had to pick one more factor they missed we might add damage from over exposure to the sun. In reality it takes quite a bit of solar exposure to do significant damage to your hair but if frequently soak up the sun it is something you should be aware of. The Beauty Brains bottom line There’s some good advice in this Refinery29 article but don’t forget how much damage you’re doing to your hair with chemical processes.","Is Refinery29 right about the worst things you do to damage your hair?","806dc7056bf3af3c92a27979a3c060bc50c7b0e7","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2013/11/is-refinery29-right-about-the-worst-things-you-do-to-damage-your-hair/"
"Randy Schueller","","Is the Remington Wet 2 Straight Iron good for hair? by Randy Schueller Bluecatbaby asks… Last year I bought a Remington Wet 2 Straight iron. It is marketed as an iron that can be used on wet hair without causing the damage that other irons cause when used on wet hair. I actually have hardly used it because I am skeptical of its claims and I hate damaging my hair. Still, the user reviews for it are mostly raves. Can it really be used on wet hair without causing damage (beyond that which is caused by any flat iron)? The Beauty Brains reply As astute reader AleV pointed out in our Forum: “I don’t think this iron causes less damage than any other flat iron. When you apply the kind of heat an iron produces over the wet hair surface the water in it will also reach high temperatures like boiling, this is going to result in some sort of blisters in the cuticle, that means a lot of damage, more than if you use it on dry hair. This damage will occur no matter if the iron is “special” or not, so you better use it on dry hair with a heat protection product or a silicon serum.” We’ve seen electron micrographs of the kind of damage that this “blister” phenomena causes so we know that’s accurate. The big question we have is how is this iron different than others? Here’s what Remington says: “Steam hydration therapy protects your hair from over-drying during this process by keeping the right amount of moisture locked in, ensuring that your hair stays healthy and sleek. This not only saves you the time of having to blow-dry before straightening, but also is better for your hair.” We don’t really know what this means because rapidly heating wet hair with an flat iron is still damaging. Unless Remington is forthcoming with additional information about how this technology works, we agree with AleV’s assessment above.

"Randy Schueller","2016-08-27 09:00:00","Depilatory or bleach – which is better for hair removal? by Randy Schueller Vick asks… Bleach or depilatory – which lasts longer or is less toxic for facial hair? The Beauty Brains respond Vick, I’m not sure what you mean when you say “less toxic” for hair. If you mean “toxic” in the sense of “poisonous” then you don’t need to worry about it because neither product will be poisonous when properly applied to skin. (Just don’t try drinking either one!) If you mean “toxic” in the sense of damaging to hair, remember that products designed to remove hair are SUPPOSED to destroy the hair, that’s how they work. Of the two, bleach is less aggressive but it also is not as effective in removing hair. At best you’ll get partial hair removal and therefore you’ll notice the facial hair sooner. In other words, it won’t seem to last as long. Bleach is really best if you just want to take some of the color out of unwanted hair so it’s less visible. If you actually want to remove hair then depilatories are the way to go. They are are very effective at destroying hair so the effect last longer. However, some people find them irritating.","Depilatory or bleach – which is better for hair removal?","277ce59dcba2dd9589c088f0ad94fff5d9d5bac2","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2015/05/depilatory-or-bleach-which-is-better-for-hair-removal/"

"Perry Romanowski","","Benefit mascara – how to find a cheaper version by Perry Romanowski Ellen inquires… What is the best mascara? I use Benefit’s “They’re Real!” and for me, it does what it says – no flaking, smudging, comes off with a little oil. But it is about 22 dollars. Is there a less expensive brand with similar characteristics? They all make the same claim! I have had to try so many, and sometimes I think they change the formula, because I have to keep changing mascara’s. As a girl, I used Great Lash, but I am 60 now and haven’t tried it for….ages. The Beauty Brains respond: To find a cheaper version of your favorite product you can use a variation of our ingredient “Rule of 5.” 1. Find the ingredient list for the product in question which in this case is Benefit’s They’re Real Mascara. (If you don’t have the package handy you can usually find it on Amazon, Drugstore.com, or the websites for national drug store chains. 2. Copy and paste the first five ingredients into the search field of your web browser. Note that the ingredient names are separated by commas. This can be confusing because some of the longer chemical names contain dashes and slashes. 3. Review the search engine results disregarding the references to the original product until you find alternate products with the same first 5 ingredients. In this case we found two brands in the first few results pages: Givenchy Phenomen’Eyes Mascara and UOUO Curl Lash Mascara. 4. Click through those links until you find the entire ingredient list for the alternate products and compare the rest of the ingredients with your target product. In this case we found that the ingredients for both the Givenchy and UOUO products were almost identical to the benefit product. 5. Locate the price and net contents for each alternate product so you can calculate a price per ounce. In our example we found that the Givenchy product was MORE expensive than Benefit but the UOUO product is considerably less (about $6 a tube for UOUO versus $22 for Benefit.) If you’re lucky, like in this example, you’ll find products that are nearly identical in composition. If only some of the ingredients match up then you’ll need a little more chemical knowledge to be able to identify the best option. (Or you can just ask us!) The Beauty Brains bottom line For a cheaper version of Benefit’s “They’re Real” mascara try UOUO Curl Lash Lengthening Mascara. The ingredients are almost identical but about 1/3 of the price.

"Perry Romanowski","None","What’s the secret of Seacret skin care? by Perry Romanowski Hayley asks (via Facebook)… Please please can you do a review on the skin line ‘ Seacret ‘? It’s newer and there’s not a lot of Info out there. The Beauty Brains respond: I got worried as soon as I saw Seacret’s audacious tagline : “Nature’s richest mineral treasure.” That’s right, this is another product line based on ingredients from the Dead Sea. Are Dead Sea salts good for skin? We’ve written before about the lack of proof that Dead Sea minerals provide any skin care benefits. The only documented benefit that we could find is that soaking in a solution of Dead Sea salts can reduce symptoms of psoriasis.

SEACRET’s collection of skincare and spa products are extracted from the ancient, and some say mystical, muds, salts and minerals found only in one place on earth, the Dead Sea.” “In a cosmetic world that often relies on half-truths and hype, and temporary solutions we believe everything we do must embody and reflect the same purity that originates from the Dead Sea, not only in our products, but also in our ongoing relationship with our customers.” “SEACRET products are manufactured in Israel with supreme care, using the latest technology and best chemists. We offer our products with the promise that they will enhance your own unique beauty.” Are the products really different?

"Randy Schueller","None","How does Osis Dust-It Texture Powder work? by Randy Schueller Hamfan asks… I just inherited some kind of cool stuff called Osis Dust-it Texture Powder from a friend. Once it’s on the hair it gets a kind of unusual tacky consistency and puffs everything up; the effect is visually similar to backcombing. The packaging says the effect is coming from silica silylate, which I’m not familiar with and haven’t been able to find much about. Just wondering what it is that activates the powder (it stays powdery in my hand, so I guess it’s not skin or heat but something particular about hair?), why that type of stickiness would create volume rather than weighing everything down (which is my usual experience with, say, gel or hair wax), and if there’s any potential for it to be damaging? The Beauty Brains respond: Believe it or not, this “Dust-it” product is actually powdered water! The power of powder We worked on this technology a few years ago: if you put water and silica silylate in a blender and pulverize it, the silica encapsulates the water. It feels like a dry powder even though it consists primarily of water! As the “capsules” are ruptured and become dried out the silica particles remain on the hair. The Osis formulators have also added Octylacrylamide/Acrylates/Butylaminoethyl Methacrylate Copolymer, a styling resin, increases the tacky feel. The combination of the tiny silica particles and the resin create sticky little ball bearings that push the hair fibers apart to create volume. Most styling gels and waxes work by coating the entire hair shaft instead of creating these little spot welds, which is why you get increased volume instead of flat, weighed down hair.

"Randy Schueller","None","Ban, a band, and a banned ingredient by Randy Schueller This 1960s Ban deodorant commercial is entertaining because it capitalized on the British Invasion, that time in our musical history when all bands were required by law to look like the Beatles. But behind this Faux Fab Four lurks a tragic beauty science secret. In the 1940s science gained a better understanding of the role that bacteria played in the development of armpit odor. With that discovery came the development of antibacterial compounds that could prevent body odor. One of the most popular ingredients was hexachlorophene which was introduced in 1948 and soon became widely used in soaps and deodorants, like Ban. By the late 1960s more and more products began using this ingredient at higher and higher levels. A baby powder product containing 6% hex caused several fatalities which led to the banning of this ingredient in 1972. Today, aerosol deodorants are much less popular than they were in the 60s.

For example, in the case of this American Crew styling putty here are the ingredients they provide: Coconut Extract, Lanolin & Castor Beans If you’re looking for a product based on naturally sourced ingredients you can’t go wrong with this three component blend, right?

"Randy Schueller","","Is a combination sunscreen and moisturizer a good idea? by Randy Schueller Iammao inquires… I typically use a separate SPF product to have better control of my skincare routine and reliable SPF coverage. However, due to recent changes in my schedule I have been tempted to use day creams with integrated SPF for convenience. I have started with La Roche Posay’s Hydraphase Intense UV which claims to have SPF20. Additionally, I practice all other sun safety measures. My main concern is, how do I know how much to use? Do I dispense the same recommended quantity as sunscreens? Is it safe to use the same amount I would use for a moisturiser? Is this form of sun protection reliable at all? The Beauty Brains respond: When it comes to sunscreen, size matters. The size of the dollop of lotion that you apply to your face, that is. If you’re relying on a foundation to provide sun protection then you need to apply just as much of this product as if you were applying a regular sunscreen. And, according to reliable sources like Skincancer.org , that means about a nickel-sized dollop to the face alone. As you noted, using separate products gives you better control and makes it easier to ensure you’re getting to the proper SPF. Using a combination product almost ALWAYS involves compromise. In this case, there’s not much downside because the worst that can happen is that your skin will end up too greasy. But if you were to use a combination sunscreen and foundation, you might find that you’re applying way too much pigment to your face in order to get the required SFP.

"Randy Schueller","None","Where did my favorite pink nail polish go? by Randy Schueller Wow, this commercial REALLY creeps me out. If you watch it without the sound it looks just like the opening to one of those late ’60’s Jack the Ripper proto-slasher flicks. You know the ones… Defenseless girl hangs out on the dimly lit water front. The cloaked villain sneaks up on her from behind. He grabs for her. She spins around. He twirls his mustache. She breaks free and brandishes her pink talons, apparently startling him for a moment. She smiles coyly and the chase beings anew. This is supposed to sell nail polish? (Maybe for self defense?) Believe it or not, there is a beauty science angle to this rant. It can be difficult to recreate these nail colors from the past (especially pink ones) because some red colors have been banned. Cosmetic colorants are highly regulated That’s right, I said banned. Many people have the impression that the cosmetics biz is the Wild West where anyone can put anything in any product. Actually that’s not true. Colorants, in particular, are highly regulated. On several occasions, when the research shows there’s is a problem, specific colorants have been prohibited from cosmetics. For some reason those red shades seem particularly pesky. And that means that you may have a favorite red or pink shade that’s no longer available.

"Randy Schueller","2014-06-06 11:14:00","Is more expensive eye shadow really different? by Randy Schueller Mamasim asks… Can the processes (methods) as opposed to ingredients, of producing a beauty product be different enough to justify the price differences in the same product type? A makeup artist I like commented in a tutorial that the reason she liked Dior eyeshadows is they have a wonderful texture. She said that when she asked a cosmetic chemist why they said it was because during its production the product was held at the ‘fat combining’ stage for slightly longer than is the norm… (???) I’m interested in knowing if high end companies use more involved methods and this is a reason why their products can be more expensive? The Beauty Brains respond: The only unusual “fat combining” process that I’m aware of is the way Perry eats a hamburger and french fries. He eats ALL the fries first THEN he eats the burger. Isn’t it normal to intersperse bites of the burger with the fries so you can enjoy the flavor of both? I mean you wouldn’t eat your entire bag of potato chips and THEN eat your ham sandwich, would you? Sheesh! But I digress… Processing can impact product cost While we stress the importance of looking at ingredients to understand the quality of a product, there are situations where the ingredients don’t tell the full story. Sometimes HOW the ingredients are put together can be tremendously important to the quality of the finished product. You don’t see this in simple mixtures, like shampoos, but you do see it on more complex products like pressed powders. Case in point: a recent article in Cosmetics & Toiletries revealed that the quality of a powder cosmetic products depends in part on how the powders are pulverized. The powders used in cosmetics can form agglomerates, or clumps. These clumps prevent the powder from having a smooth application. To avoid these clumps powders are processed to break them into tiny particles. This is commonly done using a piece of equipment called a “Hammer Mill” which basically slams metal hammers against the powder’s surface to break the pieces apart. Most manufacturers used to this type of equipment. However a more advanced process, known as “Jet Milling,” can break the particles into even smaller sizes and make them more spherical. Not surprisingly Jet Mills cost more, and not as readily available, as Hammer Mills. That means if a company wants to make a higher quality powder they either have to invest in more expensive equipment or they have to use a contract manufacturer which owns this specialized grinder. In either case the use of jet milling to create a softer feeling product results in an increased price. Therefore it’s unlikely you’ll see this used in bargain products. So the answer is yes, process can impact cost.","Is more expensive eye shadow really different?","33854bf5310f965cd9bf33eb1458e1da53618677","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2014/06/3155/"
"Perry Romanowski","","Preservatives in cosmetics – explained! by Perry Romanowski Many people seem to think that preservatives are the scariest of all cosmetic ingredients. To give you the scoop on why you need them and what they are, I’m sharing this article which was written as an introduction to cosmetic formulators. Why you need cosmetic preservatives There are two primary reasons you need preservatives. 1. To stop microbes from spoiling your products. 2. To stop microbes from causing disease. The microbes that can infect your formulas primarily include bacteria, mold, and yeast. In small quantities they don’t represent much of a problem but when they multiply, look out. Bacteria like Pseudomonas can cause all kinds of health problems including skin and eye infections, toxic shock, strep throat, and even food poisoning. Yeast like Candida albicans can cause thrush. And many other bacteria can cause your products to smell awful, change color or otherwise break down. (This is what stability testing is for). The following is a list of common preservatives used in cosmetic and personal care products. Parabens Parabens are the most commonly used preservatives. They are derivatives of p-hydroxybenzoic acid and go by names like Methylparaben, Propylparaben, and Butylparaben. They are typically supplied as powders and can sometimes be difficult to incorporate into a system due to the water solubility limitations. They are effective against a broad spectrum of bacteria and fungi. They do have pH limitations and are not effective against all microbes so you usually will need an additional preservative. Formaldehyde donors Formaldehyde derivatives are the next most common preservative. These compounds interfere with membrane proteins which kills microbes. They are effective against bacteria, fungi, and mold. Bad press and real safety concerns have led cosmetic chemists to stop using formaldehyde. Instead ingredients that dissociate into formaldehyde when put in a water solution are used. These are compounds like DMDM Hydantoin, Imidazolidinyl Urea, and Gluteraldehyde. They are most often used in surfactant systems. Phenol derivatives Phenol derivatives have been used in cosmetics for many years and can be effective against a range of microbes. Unfortunately, they are not as effective as the previous ingredients so their use is limited. The most common examples is Phenoxyethanol. Quats Compounds that contain nitrogen and have a positive charge when placed in solution are called quaternary compounds (or quats). Many of them demonstrate an ability to kill microbes. This include ingredients like Benzalkonium Chlroide, Methene aommonium chloride, and Benzethonium chloride. Their cationic nature makes them less compatible with anionic surfactants which limits their application & use. Alcohol Ethanol is a great preservative but you need to use it in high levels and it faces significant environmental restrictions. Other compounds like benzyl alcohol, dichlorobenzyl alcohol, and even propylene glycol all have some anti-microbial effect. In lower levels, these compounds are less effective at preserving products. Isothiazolones Synthetic compounds like Methylchloro- Isothiazolinone and Methyl-Isothiazolinone are effective at incredibly low levels. They have been shown to work at a wide range of pHs and in many different formulas. There use has been stymied however, by at least one study that suggested it could cause skin sensitization. Organic Acids & Others Various other compounds are used as preservatives but all face some limitations not experienced to the same extent as the previous ingredients discussed. Some of the most important include Sodium Benzoate, Chloracetamide, Triclosan, and Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate. Pyridine derivatives like Sodium pyrithione and zinc pyrithione are used to kill the bacteria that causes dandruff. Why cosmetic preservatives are vilified More than any other ingredient, preservatives are most often called out as the worst ingredients you can use in a formula. Even people who know nothing about chemistry have likely heard about the “evil” parabens and formaldehyde. Preservatives are designed to kill cells. That’s why they are effective. Unfortunately, that’s also why they are potentially hazardous. They don’t easily discriminate between good human cells and bad microbial cells. But ultimately, the risk from using preservatives is significantly lower than that of using unpreserved cosmetics. There are safe levels of “toxic” chemicals. All chemicals can be deadly if you’re exposed to a high enough level. How many people die from water exposure (e.g. drowning)? Remember, it’s the dose the matters! To be sure, cosmetic science research is ongoing in the field of preservatives since many things previously deemed safe have been reclassified as hazardous. Suppliers who can come up with even safer preservatives will likely make a lot of money. Hopefully, they’ll do it soon but there do not appear to be any promising materials on the horizon.","Preservatives in cosmetics – explained!","94dd5b0dc547d5eeec856b7b03bb3483a9d5999f","aa43-48b8-adf5","Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","http://thebeautybrains.com/2014/06/preservatives/"
"Perry Romanowski","","Does lemon juice lighten hair? by Perry Romanowski John asks… Do you remember the products that used Lemon Juice to lighten hair? If you do remember do you know how they work? I mean we know how to lighten hair with Peroxide at a pH of 11 or so, how does the Lemon Juice Work? The Beauty Brains respond: Of course we remember those products! The most popular of all was probably “Sun In” which is still on the market today. But the interesting thing about “Sun-In Lemon Fresh Hair Lightener” (as it’s formally called) is that the lemon juice is NOT what lightens your hair! Take a look at the ingredient list below and you’ll see hydrogen peroxide which, as you noted in your question, is well known for its bleaching ability. The product may be “lemony” but the peroxide is doing the real work. Does lemon juice lighten hair? Will lemon juice do anything by itself? According to one of the hair color chemists that we work with, the answer is “a little bit.” The citric acid found in lemon juice is a very weak oxidizer, so it works like peroxide but much weaker. Typically, people put lemon juice on their hair and then go out in the sun. It takes a lot of lemon juice and heat helps, and the the sun does a lot of the lightening. People want to believe that it is a safer, more natural alternative and, to some degree, it is. It’s really a matter of expectations andhow the results match those. The Beauty Brains bottom line If you want a subtle lightening effect and you don’t mind spending time in the sun, lemon juice can work as a natural hair lightening agent.
