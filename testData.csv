I have this crap too :/ Any advice would be much apreciated!
accutane got rid of mine
I can’t tell if that salicylic acid product is a face wash or a spot treatment. If it’s a wash, then I suggest removing your gentle cleanser as using those 2 together will strip your skin of oil. If it’s a spot treatment, then apply it after cleansing to any areas with acne. Salicylic acid does NOT kill bacteria, it just chemically exfoliates and unclogs your pores. As you mentioned you have whiteheads, I suggest using a product that contains either tea tree oil or benzoyl peroxide, as you get whiteheads from bacteria and those ingredients kill bacteria. I don’t have any experience with rosehip oil so I can’t talk about that, I suggest doing research on that. Also don’t pop ur pimples as those marks can take YEARS to fade, even with products to help with that. For you, if your acne is moderate to severe, I suggest using a salicylic acid face wash, followed by a tea tree oil or benzoyl peroxide spot treatment, and then followed by a light weight moisturizer that specially says it’s non comedogenic/won’t clog pores. Feel free to reply to this post or PM me with any further questions :) 

UPDATE: After doing some research, I found that many people had great experiences with rosehip oil for their acne scars
I've been using rosehip oil in my moisturizer and wearing sunscreen everyday. I get my rosehip oil from this company called The Ordinary. They also sell a serum for hyperpigmentation but I haven't been able to use it to see if it actually works.
Yes same!!! I don’t have acne as much but I do have lots of hyper pigmentation, and it sucks but I guess it’s better than having acne right ?
