The masks were made for people with all skin types, including dry, oily, and sensitive. The products in the MultiMasking collection can be mixed and matched for various areas of the face — making them ideally suited for combination skin — or they can be used individually depending on the users’ skin needs for the day. Products in the collection include the brands’ FlashMud, YouthMud, SuperMud, GravityMud, and ThirstyMu — each of which target different skin concerns. Individuals who prefer sampling products before committing, or who have highly sensitive skin, will likely benefit from the GlamGlow MultiMasking kit."],"Author":["https://www.trendhunter.com/MishalO"],"_template":"5730-4b9a-be6d","Date":["Feb 19, 2018"],"_cached_page_id":"86d26ece4ce401b90aef3c2efbb71acfeb98eef5"}]
