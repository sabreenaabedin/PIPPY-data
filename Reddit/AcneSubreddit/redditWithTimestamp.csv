I'm no expert but I think change in diet and constant exercise have changed your bodies hormonal production. But it should pass. As I said I'm not sure but that's my guess. My only tip for treating it is what I used to get rid of it is:

-Wash face with foaming cleanser twice a day, 

-don't use soap or shampoo on your face, 

-apply benzoyl peroxide on new breakouts and 

-use Jamaican black castor oil on inflamed skin and acne red spots.


I got acne suddenly at 18, no previous problems with bad acne and boom, in a few months face looked like some scientific misshap. But after a few months of patiently washing and treating my face it now looks decent, with only some marks left and occasional breakouts which I immediately take care of.  ,Sun Mar 25 12:37:55 2018
Your body may be "purging" because you exercice and eat healthier. And depending on where you are getting your break outs it could be hormonal, since your body is adjusting. 

The acne on my chin and along my jawline improved A LOT after i started drinking spearmint tea daily with half of a lemon in it. The spearmint is supposedly great to help balance your hormones and the lemon makes your whole system less acidic. Bacteria strive in acidic environment so lemon making your body more alkaline helps with acne in general and boost your immune system. ,Sun Mar 25 14:48:29 2018
Are you wearing a new sunscreen when you go out running? Are you eating a new-to-you food that you might have some sensitivities to? ,Sun Mar 25 14:58:08 2018
I have a theory that skin issues( don't take my word for it) might be caused by overeating even healthy foods. I am going to try to eat until I am 80 percent full and see if that helps. If you are eating a lot of low calorie foods in high quantities, maybe you're overtaxing your digestive system.,Sun Mar 25 16:26:22 2018
That’s a hard one man, you could be in for a tough journey or it could all blow over. Did you change anything in your diet recently?,Sun Mar 25 17:42:44 2018
I get hydrocolloid bandages and cut them into tiny circles. Sometimes they're sold as blister band aids. I stick them onto the worst lesions overnight and they help suck the pus out while keeping me from touching them before I go to sleep. I might pierce them with small gage needles (I buy them online from medical supply companies) without actually manually extracting anything before I stick the bandages on if they seem really deep.  
When I wake up, the pus shows up on the bandages and the pimples are usually a lot smaller, of not gone.  
I think knowing that I can use the bandages keeps me from popping them. I'll think to myself, "if I leave it alone all day and use a bandage tonight, the pus will come out!". Granted, if you have a lot of acne, this is probably not practical... but I imagine it would help the worst zits heal more quickly while curbing the desire to pop them.   

Before I went on two different rounds of accutane, I decided to be upfront and honest with my dermatologist. I told him "I am someone who tends to pick at my acne. I usually only pick at obvious blemishes that are already there. For some reason, they make me itch and I find myself touching them. They don't go away if I leave them alone, and I also don't pick at clear skin!"   
The reason I was honest with my dermatologist in my adult years is this... I found out as an adult that my first dermatologist diagnosed me with some kind of "neurotic" or self-induced acne, implying that as a teen I caused my own skin problems. This was laughable because I had two siblings with persistent cystic acne, so I wasn't imagining my own bad skin. In hindsight, he only gave me very mild treatments and my acne was really horrible at times.  
The dermatologist I saw as an adult actually listened to me, and seemed to appreciate the fact that I was honest. He seemed to be more willing to provide me with more intense treatments. The only way I truly never pick is if my skin isn't going berserk. As I said, though, the bandages really help keep me from picking at any acne I get as an adult.

I only do my nightly routine with partial lights on. It keeps me from noticing all the small little imperfections. Also, if you have two pimples that are similar, pop one and leave the other one as an experiment. I saw that when I left it alone it healed much faster and that's been a good motivating factor for me. ,Sun Mar 25 09:52:25 2018
I’ve always been a compulsive skin picker, and I honestly believe my skin would be 75% clearer if I could just keep my grubby little mitts off my face. :P I realized I was constantly picking my face on days I spent at home, whether in the bathroom mirror every time I went to pee or in the makeup mirror on my desk while sitting at my computer. Here’s what I’ve been trying to do for the past week or so to break those bad habits:

1. When I’m standing at my bathroom mirror, I don’t allow myself to lean in closer than the edge of my sink, if that makes sense. That keeps me at about a 1.5’ distance from the mirror, which is about as close you'd get to most people during the day. There’s really no need to concern yourself with any breakouts that you'd need to be an inch away to notice. From that distance, I can still see scarring and obvious pustules that are ready to be extracted, but it prevents me from picking at every little closed comedone and blackhead on my face until I’m a tomato.

2. I started storing my makeup mirror up on a shelf instead of at my desk, and only allow myself to take it down to apply my makeup in the morning. When it’s not sitting out, I’m not tempted by it.

3. It's really tempting for me to pick after oil cleansing my makeup off, since that reveals acne that was covered by concealer throughout the day. So instead of picking my face between oil cleansing and the rest of my PM skin care, I go straight to my cleanser and then put a manuka honey face mask on. That prevents me from seeing/touching anything and delivers some soothing, hydrating, and antimicrobial properties to my poor skin that’s been suffocating under makeup for 12 hours.

I also make it a general rule to keep my hands off my face throughout the day, so I'm not absentmindedly picking at scabs or feeling around for under-the-skin blemishes. I only just started doing these things, but I’ve noticed that my redness, breakouts, and congestion have improved. Hope this helps!,Sun Mar 25 10:29:03 2018
In high school my statistics professor told me about a study.  He explained to the class that if you have any little habbit/tick you'd like to get rid of, just count how many times you do it each day.  For example, I cracked my knuckles all the time, whether it be during class, in the middle of a conversation, or doing school work at home.  I noticed how often I did this and wanted to stop.  But, like you said, it was harder said than done.  Bad habits are extremely hard to break. 

Anyway, I decided to start a little chart. (At first I did it on my phone, just typing in the number into a notes page.  Later, I carried around a small piece of paper in my pocket). Every time I cracked a knuckle, I would write down one tally.  Start tallying as soon as you wake up until the moment you go to sleep.  The first day I did this I had about 30 tallys.  The second day I did this I had about 20 tallys.  As you get into this routine of tallying, you will realize how often you truly do the bad habit.  The tallys become a huge inconvenience to your daily life (it's very annoying to mark a tally EVERY time you do the bad habit).  However, that motivates you to stop the bad habit because you don't want to do the extra step that it will require. On the third day, I began to notice when I would move my hands together to start a knuckle-crack.  I began to be able to stop myself before my body subconsciously performed the bad habit.  On that third day, I was down to maybe 5 or 10 tallys.  By the 7th day I had no tallys.  However, it was still difficult to prevent myself and I had to catch myself going for a knuckle-crack before I relapsed lol.  

I have also used this technique with picking my nails, which has so far been successful. And, like you, I am starting to do this technique with "face-touches" as well. I have found the face-touches to be a more difficult one because sometimes I have itches that aren't really itches.  It's hard to explain, but I feel you.  I think my skin would become cleaner after stopping these face-touches too.  Good luck to ye, I hope this strategy will help.  ,Sun Mar 25 11:04:49 2018

I am guilty of this too. Waiting to see what tips people give you!,Sun Mar 25 00:29:25 2018
I put strands of tape over my pimples in the morning and took them off when I went to sleep so they could heal overnight, I was that bad of a picker, best of luck m8,Sun Mar 25 01:53:25 2018
Try taking a Zinc supplement pill with every meal to accelerate the healing.

It really can be difficult to have the self control and not to obsess especially when it's so central to your appearance. But the more you realize that putting your fingers anywhere near your face never leads to anything good and slows down the healing, the easier it is to resist. ,Sun Mar 25 10:03:03 2018
sometimes i'll leave the door open a crack so i have less privacy, giving me motivation to stick to business (skincare routine + brush teeth) and get out quickly. reminds me that i'm going to have to "face" the people outside the door when i get out and i don't want to be a big splotchy mess. mantra: it's counterproductive to pick; it's going to make things worse.,Sun Mar 25 16:13:37 2018
I find that the oil cleansing method is good for my skin. My skin is mostly oily but my chin and the skin around my mouth often gets really dry and some patches on my forehead too. I use hemp seed oil to oil cleanse and i no longer have the dry patches and the oily parts dont get more oily. 

Hemp oil is great and is not comedogenic but most people choose to begin with mineral oil to experiment with OCM.,Sun Mar 25 14:53:52 2018
Use different products for every part of your face.

I use spot treatment on the witheheads only
I use mineral oil on my jaw line only since it's dry .

I don't put niacinamide on my neck but I do on my face etc ,Sun Mar 25 11:07:06 2018
You can try exfoliating with aha/bha (Stridex for example) or using a scrub, but be gentle! Also sunscreen is a must! You can also try snail mucin. :) Hope this helped a bit! ,Sun Mar 25 04:42:25 2018
That's my struggle all my life(lasers,peels etc to no avail).But a month ago I decided to start blow a kiss to my reflection in the mirror right after I did my make-up. I decided just for a second to allow to love myself -all my imperfections(took me almost 40years). Now that second grew up to  5 minutes...the rest of the day I dont even look in the mirror(((( I hope that might help somebody out there in the big scary frustrating world! ,Sat Mar 24 10:15:26 2018
Flirt with the mirror! Put some music that makes you feel cute and move and approach and kiss and I promise you it will boost your confidence tremendously ,Sat Mar 24 14:26:10 2018
A little imperfection doesn’t make you less beautiful! You are still the same person and trust me a lot of people don’t even care about those little things on your face that sometimes make you feel down. They care about you, your smile, the way you laugh and the way they feel when they are with you! So be happy and don’t let something so insignificant stop you from loving yourself and others,Sat Mar 24 15:09:07 2018
Great post.  A lot of the time I was looking for acceptance from others to gain my self confidence. That just led to disappointment. Now, much like yourself, I have learned to love my self and all my flaws. In saying that, getting closer to God has filled the void in my spirit. I focus more on the meaningful things in life like my children, my amazing wife, and growing in my faith. Vanity had left my heart and soul in despair. Funny thing is, when you love yourself, truly love yourself, your inner beauty comes out. A smile or lighthearted personality. That’s what my aim is. I don’t want these scars to blacken my heart. I want to live and be truly happy!,Sun Mar 25 03:23:43 2018
Wanna know an even better way to love yourself? Get some lube, a laptop, and some tissues. ,Sat Mar 24 23:54:56 2018
low dose will keep your acne away while you’re still taking the medication, but as soon as you stop your acne will come back. in order for accutane to have lasting effects, meaning to stay clear even when you’re no longer on the medication, you have to reach a certain cumulative dose based on your body weight ,Sun Mar 25 04:48:38 2018
Have you tried differin gel yet?? It takes about 3 months to work but is really effective. ,Sun Mar 25 05:42:50 2018
no dont Accutane can have baddd side effects,Sun Mar 25 09:41:31 2018
Hormonal acne is caused by androgens forcing our skin cells to move through their replication process faster, resulting in clogged pores that turn into acne. Since you aren't treating the hormonal initiating trigger anymore, you can still use topicals to help slough off those poorly formed skin cells and keep the bacterial populations low. So a low dose benzoyl peroxide, low dose glycolic acid products or salicylic acid can all exfoliate the skin, benzoyl peroxide also reduces P. acnes bacteria populations. ,Sat Mar 24 19:18:35 2018
Spirolactone treats hormonal acne and your derm should give it t o you unless you have a health problem or you're trying to get pregnant.,Sat Mar 24 21:57:18 2018
I got off bc last February and my skin began freaking out. I tried everything before finally seeing a dermatologist, I went through several different products (I've discovered I'm allergic to benzoyl peroxide!) and now I'm in 5th month of accutane. I really wish I had gone to see a dermatologist a lot sooner than I did, because I dealt with awful acne for several months thinking if I just found the right product or did x,y,z I could fix the problem myself. ,Sun Mar 25 00:32:38 2018
I got off birth control in september 2017 and my skin broke out for the first 5 months off it, its been getting a lot better now. Be patient and baby your skin, your hormones can take up to a year to regulate and you may break out until then. ,Sun Mar 25 02:57:04 2018
High frequency treatments!!!,Sat Mar 24 21:16:38 2018
I got off bc about 6 months ago and I take a probiotic daily, and a superfood vitamin. This stuff really helps my acne. 
,Sat Mar 24 22:42:36 2018
You can treat it the same way you would facial acne. Get a body wash with benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid for the shower and a treatment to put on after. Since benzoyl peroxide bleaches color out of fabric I recommend 0.1% adapalene, if you are in the US and see if this helps after a few weeks. 
You can also go to day spa, a lot of them offer "back facials" to help with back acne. ,Sat Mar 24 18:56:32 2018
I was on Roaccutane 40mg daily for 6 months - I believe my acne was hormonal due to PCOS. I have lost weight and now I have also been cleared of PCOS!!
Prior to this I tried the oral contraceptive pill, broad spectrum antibiotics (doxycycline), and Adapalene/benzoyl peroxide gel (Epiduo). 

Under the guidance of my dermatologist whilst on Roaccutane the products I used were...
Once daily: 
Cetaphil Daily Facial Cleanser 
Cetaphil Daily Facial Moisturiser

People give accutane a bad name... personally it was *the only thing* that helped curb my treatment resistant acne as an adult. I had to go through two rounds of it.  
I was put on so many antibiotics as a teen that literally no regular antibiotic works on me when I have a sinus infection or any other non–acne infection.  
I had fewer side effects with accutane than I did with tetracycline. ,Sat Mar 24 11:57:29 2018
unfortunately for me i can't take roaccutane because it negatively affected tablets that i took for a more severe problem so ye :( the 2 weeks that i took roaccutane before they realised it was bad for me i felt such a big difference but now i can't take it and everything else I've tried doesn't work out :(,Sat Mar 24 16:47:45 2018

I’m on minocycline, which is in the same family. They’re very commonly prescribed for acne. I saw results immediately to be honest, but I am also on tretinoin. I’ve been taking them for almost 4 weeks and I have no pimples currently ,Sat Mar 24 22:33:59 2018
I was on doxycycline for two months a few years back and really preferred it over another antibiotic I was prescribed a few years later which I believe was called minocycline. I had an initial purge (of acne that was already deep in my skin coming to the surface) that lasted about a week, but other than that I feel like it started working pretty fast because I didn't develop any new cystic acne after I started taking it. My only side effect was light headaches and some visual sun sensitivity. ,Sat Mar 24 22:37:39 2018
I just got put on doxy! Now I wait...,Sat Mar 24 23:01:44 2018
Doxycycline is a lifesaver.,Sun Mar 25 00:51:13 2018
Have you tried topicals for acne in the past? You could add rose hip oil to your routine, after the toner. Rose hip oil is high in linoleic acid, an essential fatty acid for skin to properly construct itself, that can help with both dryness and acne. A moisturizing mask a couple times a week can help too. ,Sat Mar 24 19:23:04 2018
Retin-A is a retinoid, not a cortisol, there aren't any long term adverse affects from topical retinoids, that I've heard of. If you are in the US, Adapalene at 0.1% is available over the counter now. The original brand name is Differin, but Proactiv has one now and I'm sure there's generics too. Adapalene is also a retinoid; it's a third generation, whereas Retin-A is a first and can be more irritating, and Adapalene should be more gentle on your skin and be just as effective! ,Sat Mar 24 20:52:10 2018
wow thanks for such a detailed answer! i’ll tell my mom about retina not having long term effects. if that doesn’t work i’ll try to go for over the counter. Thanks!,Sat Mar 24 22:17:03 2018
The red marks will fade, but it can take 6-12 months. Accutane slows down your body’s healing abilities so they might fade slower than typical while you’re on the medication. 

You could try a color correcting cream or concealer to cover them in the meantime. Be sure to wear sunscreen every day to keep them from getting darker.,Sat Mar 24 15:18:23 2018
rosehip seed oil, glycolic acid, vitamin c, and always making sure to wear sunscreen ,Sat Mar 24 10:36:56 2018
Try bio-oil, rosehip seed oil, vitamin C and snail mucin. Sunscreen is a must too. ,Sat Mar 24 12:01:15 2018
My treatment includes derm visits for glycolic acid peels (1/mo) and cortisone injections (1/6 weeks), extractions from the esthetician (1/3 weeks), Epicuren cleansing system (cleanser, toner, probiotic moisturizer, sunscreen, spot treatment).

Try not eating any animal products. Meat, milk, cheese, eggs, fish. They all cause inflammation which leads to acne. ,Sat Mar 24 02:18:34 2018
I stopped washing my face it worked just use some water in the shower sometimes or if Im washing my hair i usually let my face air dry or sometimes use a towel ,Sat Mar 24 05:00:28 2018
Inflammatory acne is the worst type I got mine because of my poor diet based on Maltodextrin (An additive in form of powder made from corn, rice, potato starch, or wheat (high glycemic index foods)) which is highly processed. My sugar levels spiked and later on I developed sugar sensitivity. I was taking a mass gainer (supplements) and my diet was poor. 
The first step will be getting rid of all high glycemic index foods in your diet and also all inflammatory ingredients. Stop eating gluten, red meats, cookies, cereal, chips, processed foods and avoid eating after 8 pm. Stop drinking cow’s milk, coffee, chocolate and sodas. Go to sleep early (around 11 pm or earlier) wash your face everyday twice (mornings and before you go to sleep) (you don’t have to do your face routine twice you can just put some water on your face in the mornings and do your routine at night) I want to highlight “wash your face everyday twice a week” that’s a key point if you already have a good diet low in sugars (fructose, glucose, sucrose, etc) I would like to add some tips such as avoid using any type of face brush they will only spread the bacteria on your face is one of the bigger mistakes you can make, this is the type of stuff people buy to get rid of one or two pimples they got but it doesn’t work if you have a lot of pimples. Ignore those good reviews on youtube from people who are either getting paid for promotion or never had really bad acne. Oh and my mind is blurry on this, but I remember African black soap from the brand Nubian getting rid of the inflammation from my new acne caused by the face brush I bought so you may want to try that for a week or more if you see that it works for you too I think you can buy this soap in Walmart for less than 10 dollars i’m not really sure what’s the price. I could tell you all the products that I have used and which ones worked for me, but I believe that what I just wrote will be a huge help for you would like you can always send me a message and we can keep talking about this journey!,Sat Mar 24 14:41:06 2018

Dermablend has a cover up meant for areas of the body if you want to check it out.

Andy suggestions?,Fri Mar 23 16:46:19 2018
Try to find the food that cause you to break out, the most common are: dairy, spicy foods, gluten, peanuts, sugar ecc... if this doesn’t work you may have an hormonal imbalance ( as you wrote you don’t always breakout) very common on the chin in women especially or an allergy to other kind of food. Try to exfoliate with chemical peels (glycolic or salycidic) and put benzoil peroxide when you breakout on the zits. Let us know if it improve :),Fri Mar 23 18:18:11 2018
I used to get acne just like that and read online that it could be the fluoride in toothpaste. I switched to a fluoride free one from toms and it definitely helped. I still get some occasionally but it's much less frequent now! I would look into that if you haven't already ,Fri Mar 23 19:29:56 2018
I’m trying to identify why I’m recently getting lots of whiteheads around my mouth/chin. I usually get acne on my cheeks and they are mostly not whiteheads.  But more recently, I’ve been getting these aggressive whiteheads in these spots.  Any idea on what’s causing them and how I could prevent it from happening further?,Fri Mar 23 19:49:58 2018
Looks like acne caused by bacteria. Change your pillow covers everyday or once every two days. Avoid any type of face brush since they will only spread the bacteria. You are one step from messing up your face for months/years and one step from getting rid of those pimples. Be careful. I wouldn’t recommend using acne products since they can actually spread your acne. Take a shower everyday (don’t let the water hit your face directly since it will cause inflammation) go to sleep before 12 (I noticed that when I don’t go to sleep early my pimples get bigger no matter what I put them on, they just don’t seem to heal if you stay up overnight and will actually increase in size) oh and avoid eating/drinking inflammatory foods such as chocolate, or cow’s milk. Hope that helped I tried to keep it simple so you could follow up and of course avoid doing something that you will regret later!,Sat Mar 24 14:52:44 2018

Less is more in my experience. Historically humans have never put chemicals all over their faces, especially the harsh ones you'll find in some treatments.

A lot of them will simply irritate your skin rather than help it.

If you're gonna use a treatment it should be prescribed by a demo not a pharmacy clerk. ,Sun Mar 25 10:15:40 2018
have you tried an exfoliant to release the whitehead’s before they become worse and painful?,Fri Mar 23 18:13:13 2018
The first time I had one of these, it was sore like a pimple but no head. I eventually squeezed it and sebum came out while the soreness went away, so presumably a pretty clogged up pore. The ones above aren’t sore like that, just a bit unsightly and a tiny bit red. I’ve started gently exfoliating my neck to see if it helps, but I’m not even really sure what these bumps are.,Fri Mar 23 10:10:18 2018

Try out TreeActiv Acne Eliminating Face Cleanser. Someone reccomned it to me here and it has worked so well for me. ,Fri Mar 23 16:51:14 2018
I'd add a benzoyl peroxide leave-on treatment after cleansing and before the moisturizer. Start with a 2.5% product and after a few months if it's not effective, you can go to the 10%. If you are in the US, Differin, or Adapalene at 0.1% is available over-the-counter now, you could try that instead of the benzoyl peroxide.  ,Thu Mar 22 23:24:23 2018
Someone else recommended benzyl peroxide. I’d recommend that too. Have you tried changing your diet? No dairy, more vitamin A and vitamin E consumption. What’s your skin like with your current routine? Oily, dry?,Fri Mar 23 00:09:08 2018
Could be your hair care products. I broke out so badly on my forehead once my hair started looking nice. Sigh.,Fri Mar 23 01:12:22 2018
See if you can find Clean and Clear Advantage Acne Control Kit. It has benzyol peroxide in 2 of it's 3 products and has been working wonders for my own forhead/face acne. It comes with a daily formula that cleans and opens up pores, a fast acting treatment that u dab on specific pimples, and a moisturizer that helps your face not feel like clay. It cost me $20 at a Wallgreens and I've had it for 4 days now and I see a difference. I use it daily (at night) after I take a shower, in which I have a soap that makes my face dry and removes oil alongside some minor cleansing. Once I get out of the shower (the facial soap is the last thing I do) I splash warm water on my face, apply the cleaner formula and leave it on for 5 mins. Then I wash it off and put the fast acting treatment on the pimples/clusters of pimples and finally I add the moisturizer. ,Fri Mar 23 00:21:58 2018
i’ve found in my lengthy acne struggle that forehead acne is typically attributed to your diet. consider going without dairy, added sugars, and fried foods for a week and see what comes of it!,Fri Mar 23 02:04:30 2018
I use 10% benzoyl peroxide or Mario Badescu’s drying lotion. Then I have a skip night where I just use moisturizer. ,Fri Mar 23 03:45:17 2018
Definitely add benzoyl peroxide as an overnight treatment and add sunscreen to your routine. Acne treatments leave the skin extremely vulnerable to the sun. ,Fri Mar 23 06:57:13 2018
Thanks everybody, I’ll definitely try some benzoyl peroxide!,Fri Mar 23 08:35:57 2018

Could it be flushing? Does the skin feel warm to the touch, almost like a blush or how a fever feels but isolated to the red area?,Fri Mar 23 12:56:13 2018
Not sure but just thought I’d mention vani cream. If you haven’t heard of it, it’s extremely gentle moisturizer. It’s great for people with acne and eczema. My dermatologist recommended it. You can google it and read the reviews. They sell it in target. It’s about $11. Worth a try maybe. ,Fri Mar 23 23:51:51 2018
You need cell turn over.  Look into micro needling once you are all clear, and then find a retinol + Vit A combo med that can work to revitalize those dermoid layers.  Be careful as to which micro needle took you use.  They can cause more harm than good if you get a bad one.  Think teeny tiny length, and little bitty bore type needles.  ,Fri Mar 23 00:38:08 2018
So I've basically had bad cystic acne the past year because of bad habits (I was actually clear for 3 years before that and had a bad few years of cystic acne as a teen) - so I'm on Accutane again and no pimples again after the first month.

Issue is the scars are remaining - this was taken about a month or two ago so some of my scars have actually ligteneed and gotten better overall but I wanted to know if there's anything I should look into for more help

I have Vitamin C oil and was considering Radha Beauty Roseship Oil, but wasn't sure how much I should be spreading it on my scars - like more than once? or just once a daily? Says daily on Vit C so wanted to be sure

Also would love tips for anything else tha tmight work. I am going on vacation in 2 months and would love to see a great improvement if not a clear face. It's just my cheek and the cheek I showed in the pic is the worser of the two. 

Appreciate any advice I can get!,Thu Mar 22 23:55:42 2018
Dermarolling is fine, but it does have its limits on what it can fix. If you scars are indented it may not help out that much. It may make them less noticeable, but I doubt it could ever completely heal them.,Fri Mar 23 10:31:34 2018
What's your current routine? What's your skin like, dry/oily? Have you tried stuff that didn't work for you? Have you seen a medical professional? ,Thu Mar 22 19:07:22 2018
Talk to a professional. Severe acne needs a more aggressive treatment than regular cleansers.

Speaking from experience, you may want to consider birth control. Acne is caused by an imbalance of hormones and birth control balances it out and is actually a really common way to treat acne. It worked wonders for myself, and with topical treatments like differin and aczone, I no longer have acne. 

But these treatments need the approval of doctors, so book yourself with a dermatologist, who if they think you need it, will then refer you to an OBGYN. ,Thu Mar 22 21:04:08 2018
Appreciate all the comments, my routine is currently 
AM 
Acne Proof Daily Scrub Neotrugena BP 2.5%
Cetaphil Hyaluronic Acid Daily Moisturizer 
PM
Clean and Clear Exofoliating Scub (no actives) to get rid of makeup
Pan Oxyl Daily Acne Wash  10% BP
Differin Gel Adapelene 1% 
 Vaseline and moisturizer as needed
I have combination skin, can range from being super oily for three days to flaking for three days. Have been dealing with acne for 5+ years. Being blocked from my insurance by my parents because of derma costs and don't make enough money to pay out of pocket on my own. Constant struggle and absolutely horrendous for my self esteem. Thanks for all the previous advice, keep it coming! ,Thu Mar 22 23:24:23 2018
Basic routine for morning and night
Cleanse with gentle cleanser like the Simple brand gel cleanser 
Treatment: 2.5% benzoyl peroxide all over face; I use Neutrogena On The Spot Treatment 
Moisturize: use SPF during the day and no SPF at night

Or get the ProActiv system 

Unfortunately acne is complicated and has several different root causes, and you have to be consistent and patient, two things no one wants to be with acne. If after 4-6 weeks of being consistent with product usage and you see little to no improvement, try Differin, you can get it otc in the US now or adding a glycolic acid treatment or moisturizer. ,Thu Mar 22 22:16:26 2018

Hey Skincare Friends,

Are there any experts about who can tell me why I’ve had a patch of acne here for 3 years?  It started off with 2 or 3 cyst like spots that stayed for about 6 months and it’s evolved into this.  
My doctor put me on anti bs previously which do help when I’m on them, but it comes back immediately if I skip a few days.
I don’t understand any dermatology so it’s all an enigma to me.  I would really appreciate a steer in the right direction to inform my next discussion with the doctor.
Cheers!,Thu Mar 22 17:10:49 2018
I have very similar skin to yours but I get it on both cheeks. I'm fairly sure mine is hormonal- does yours flair up at all or is it fairly consistent? If it flairs up with your hormones Drs may suggest something like birth control to manage it. 

Either way I know it sucks but without sounding like a cliche I've learnt to live with mine and it's genuinely not held me back in finding partners or friends. ,Thu Mar 22 18:28:36 2018
Hi! 

No dermatologist here, but I get cystic acne on my face as well! Usually on my forehead. I take probiotics, these help with the bacteria on your face and with your skin! I would definitely try buying some. You can get them at your local pharmacy or dug store. I would recommend trying a 5 billion culture. Also, zinc and L-lysine supplements help a lot too! Try to cut out some dairy. Mainly milk, yogurt or cheese. Drink lots of water and maybe use a super gentle cleaner? I use cetaphil, you don’t want to strip the skin of its natural oils. Try not to pick at it, drink tons of water and hope for the best? Also if I break out super bad I just go to the tanning salon. I always find it help clear things up as well! ,Thu Mar 22 18:58:11 2018
Ever been prescribed Spironolactone?,Thu Mar 22 18:35:50 2018
Since it is one particular patch on the face, think about things you might do differently there. For example, is it the side of the face you use to talk on your phone? Phone touching the face can commonly causes breakouts. Do you always sleep/lay down on this side? Sometimes changing pillow cases more frequently or sleeping on a towel can help.,Sat Mar 24 19:57:02 2018
I have, but it gets better! ,Thu Mar 22 16:10:13 2018
One of my uncles has facial scars extremely similar to yours. My late grandmother always regretted not taking him to see a doctor/dermatologist despite the lack of money in the family. Since the way my uncle’s face looks is the only way I’ve ever known him to look, I never gave it a second thought.- it gives him character.
Of course you know the time frame it can take Accutane to work... the important thing is that you’re on your way to success!,Thu Mar 22 18:02:26 2018
I really wish there was a solid way of getting rid of these kinds of scars without spending hundreds in treatment. Unfortunately none of the options are covered under insurance. ,Thu Mar 22 23:16:28 2018
I would recommend Stridex pads in the red box, and Paula’s Choice also makes great BHA liquids in their Clear Line as well as a spray. If you choose the PC route, just use a cotton round to apply it. The salicylic really does work, but it takes about 2 weeks! ,Thu Mar 22 21:33:03 2018
You can try gentle chemical exfoliant (maybe Stridex as someone suggested) and then moisturizing gently. Don't use scrubs. Find gentle low pH body wash.,Fri Mar 23 04:37:18 2018
I do too. Sometimes I'll go to the bathroom, see my face, go and eat something I probably shouldn't, go back into the bathroom a few hours later and there are spots where there weren't any before.

It's infuriating. Theres a girl on my degree course, drinks full sugar coke, eats shit all the time and I swear to you she doesn't even have pores.

We lost the genetic lottery my friend. ,Thu Mar 22 20:17:50 2018
Sugar feeds bacterial growth so it makes sense. Not a trigger for me but I can see why it does for some. ,Thu Mar 22 18:37:14 2018
Sugar does this to me too. It's inflammatory as is and I guess my body is extra sensitive to it. Flares up my eczema/psoriasis as well.,Thu Mar 22 21:31:24 2018
My skin has been clearing rapidly since we ran out of holiday candy and Girl Scout cookies. There's definitely a correlation. 
,Fri Mar 23 17:01:30 2018
Educate your bf. People, especially those who have not experienced acne/severe acne simply do not understand the struggle unless you lay out the facts. I know that because I was the same as him, only when developing acne later in life did I understand. Having that negativity in your life is not good for you. ,Thu Mar 22 16:04:20 2018
i would continue accutane. some people just require a higher dose,Thu Mar 22 14:51:13 2018
I would recommend trying to weed high-hormone foods out of your diet and see if that helps. 

I didn't have any acne all through high school, but as soon as I went to college I broke out terribly with cystic acne. Calling my mom to tell her about it rendered the same results -- "you're not washing your face often, you never did at home!" etc. etc. 

When I went home for Christmas break, my mom opened the door and recoiled in horror at how bad my skin had gotten. Next day, we were off to the derm who put me on oral tetracycline and a cream that I can't recall the name of. My skin cleared up magnificently and, besides the occasional hormonal pimple, my acne was gone.

Flash forward another 6 years and bam! I started getting break outs left and right of a completely different kind of acne than I had ever experienced before. After months of battling it with creams, toners, soaps, etc. I decided to cut dairy out of my diet. Two weeks later my skin cleared and I haven't had a pimple, besides one damn period pimple that rears it's uggo head relentlessly each month, since.

I suggest it because it really helped me and you truly have no idea, unless you're eating a completely organic diet, just what hormonal BS is in foods and how that could be affecting you. 

Good luck! I completely feel your pain and wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy. xx,Thu Mar 22 15:47:09 2018
I'm not trying to be annoying by asking this, because you said you've tried everything. .but have you ever been put on spironolactone? I went on it about 6 years ago, and then it was like an unheard of medication..I actually printed documents to hand to the doctor because he didn't even know what it was.  I've had zero side effects and for a few years I had clear skin. I break out still but not like I used to.,Thu Mar 22 15:23:19 2018
Out of the things you’ve tried, I didn’t see anything related to changing your diet. Overall, diet has been THE number one thing that causes my acne. I’m 37 and have been dealing with it for 15 years. I also did accutane, two rounds, and ended up with poor night vision and tinnitus. It’s taken me 13+ years to determine what I put in my body causes me to break out. I mostly have it under control, but if I slip up in my diet, I’m back to where I started. I highly recommend removing dairy, eggs, wheat and sugar (ALL added sugars and even high sugar fruits) to start. Alcohol too. And for me - vaping and cigarettes as well. You can do an elimination diet, cut everything out for 2 weeks and see there is any improvement. If not, then maybe go for accutane again. Good luck! I feel your pain!!!,Thu Mar 22 18:37:06 2018
I feel you. I never had severe acne. It was hormonal and perhaps at the very start in my teens bacterial. I took care of my skin, started the pill, went to the dermatologist, and took some pills. All gone bar the occasional hormonal cycle pimple. Stopped taking the pill at 31 years of age and boom! Full blown hormonal cystic acne has exploded my chin and upper lip. I moved countries so I also know it is not all hormonal, its also stress related. Getting back on the pill is also not an option at the time. So... I feel like scraping my own skin off.
I have no miracle advice for ya. Just saying, I feel you. It fucking sucks. ,Thu Mar 22 20:15:58 2018
Continue the accutane, it will cure your acne for good. You just need to stick to a good routine, deal with side affects appropriately and keep taking whatever amount of dosage.,Fri Mar 23 01:29:47 2018
You should read my post on cure for acne. I'm 21 year old guy who had acne since 12, called pizza face for long time, but and tbh there is some truth to what your bf says. Specifically, acne is caused by harsh application of products as well as harsh products... and dehydration of face by not protecting it with oil and using cleanser or soap on to hard face, pulling out oil and water as well.

He is right in a way, if you did less to irritate your face maybe your acne would go down. My post explains all this.,Fri Mar 23 06:36:23 2018
Accutane. I know how it feels to be so frustrated that the acne is coming back again and again, I’m going on my third round in a few weeks (I’m 18F). I’ve had those people in my life that do notttttt get it at all and it’s so demeaning and feels so invalidating that they don’t understand that there’s nothing you can do about acne sometimes. Most of the time people with acne do wash their face and take even better care of themselves than our clear skinned counterparts. Personally accutane is truly all that’s worked to get my acne gone, each time it’s never come back as bad as the very first time so I’m hoping for this to be my last round of it and then hopefully it’ll only be really small stuff, if it ever returns, that’ll be manageable with OTC treatments. I’m wishing you the best of luck, and hope educating your bf and those around you helps as well as the accutane if you decide to go back on!!,Fri Mar 23 10:48:59 2018
Personally I don't agree with harsh treatments like Accutane, but more power to you if it works. I like taking an all natural approach, and it's seeming like absolutely nothing has worked for me. I've tried everything, absolutely everything except accutane or anything of the sort. I've been doing lots of research on it and I'm coming to the conclusion that mine is mostly hormonal, stress and maybe just genetic, my younger brother started having issues when he hit high school too. Either way, my next attempt is going to be consuming yellow dock root every day. It's a blood purifier, it also helps with stage 2 liver detoxification. So, this will help my liver process and filter any unnecessary hormones and toxins in my body that get built up, resulting in (hopefully) clearer skin. I've also found that mixing a 1:1 ratio of apple cider vinegar and water and applying that every day helps too. I also take 4,000iu of Vitamin D3 every day, that's definitely helped a little bit too. But I'm with you, I'm also 22 and just exhausted and frustrated more than I can explain about STILL having acne. I can keep you updated on whether the yellow dock helps me, if you want.,Thu Mar 22 16:14:53 2018
Sunscreen every day! If you don't already wear it, that is. This is definitely the biggest thing that helps me. 

I've heard that some people use Vaseline as a skin protectant after their moisturizer at night to lock in moisture, but since these "dots" are actually hyper pigmentation and not regular scarring I don't know how effective it would be at speeding up the process of them fading. 

Anytime I get a cystic acne breakout, I can look forward to these suckers for about 6 months. It's so annoying 🙄🙄 

With sunscreen I can usually half the amount of time it would normally take them to fade. ,Thu Mar 22 22:35:35 2018

The #1 rated skin care in the US is Rodan and Fields.  I would start there and see what they have to offer.  MHO,Thu Mar 22 18:19:26 2018
I would add either a 2.5% benzoyl peroxide treatment or 0.1% Adapalene to help get rid of the acne.  Reducing the comedones may help with reducing the oil too.  I've had good luck with using a generic version of Mederma for PIH, but it did take the whole bottle applied regularly to see results.  You could swap out the Nivea moisturizer for one with glycolic acid in it, to help with exfoliation and keeping those pores clear.,Fri Mar 23 00:56:46 2018
Lol thats literally so relateable, i have crazy scarring too and i wear my hood lol. I thought i was the only one.,Thu Mar 22 03:23:23 2018
Have you tried chemical peels? , I do that at home but they're professional strength. During Ultas 21 day sale they'll be on sale from 77$ to 38$. I use Exuviance AP 25 peelsC I also use Murads intense C radiance peel but the Exuviance is stronger? I would give it a try didn't have I've pick scars, but I had some red scarring around my chin that's basically gone. It's worth a shot ,Thu Mar 22 05:56:25 2018
I would say youd probably have to do laser treatments or microderm or something.

Theose scars are pretty common in people, no matter how many you have. Yes, we all feel bad about them, but getting over them is key in feeling better about yourself.

I have a HUGE deep pitted scar on my cheek from cystic acne. Its about an inch long and 1 or a couple cm deep. I also have the ive pick scars. I got over it bc there are some people with worse skin conditions than I. Infortunately, surgery would prob be the only way.,Thu Mar 22 06:02:09 2018
You can do lasers or dermapen, brian turner ( a fitness youtuber who had acne did a video serie about this topic) .... but you have to accept scarring and be proud of the battle you won, cause they will stay on your face forever... at least accepting that helped me a lot,Thu Mar 22 13:06:20 2018
Can you feel it under your skin? Like a hard bump? If yes, then yes. ,Thu Mar 22 10:58:41 2018
Yes they are, treat with benzoyl peroxidea and OTC topicals for now, if it isn't getting better, you should see dermatologist.,Fri Mar 23 01:27:12 2018
I only ever get these cystic spots around my jawline. Starts as a bump and comes to a head about 3 days later and leaves a nasty scab.

BP to spot treat as SOON as it forms really helps. But you have to get it super early. These days I use my tret gel. I only use it 3x a week but if there's a cyst waiting to erupt, I will spot treat 5-7x a week until it goes away.,Thu Mar 22 21:33:26 2018
drinking tons and tons of water has cut my breakouts in half! i get cystic pimples during pms so i make sure to drink lots of water leading up to that week and during it and i've seen a huge difference. also applying neutrogena hydro boost gel before bed. i've heard that cysts pop up more when your skin is dehydrated.,Sat Mar 24 13:08:38 2018
Yes. It worked for me for me as well but had to stop because it wasn’t a permanent solution to my acne (and like you they made a stronger comeback). Reliance on antibiotics would require a stronger and stronger dose every cycle to combat stronger acne production. Your doctor should know what to do about it. Sorry i aint of much help,Thu Mar 22 00:45:07 2018
The same thing happened to me when I was on Doxycycline. I used Proactive concomitantly just like you've been doing, funny enough. I found that the doxycycline stopped working for me about 6 months into use. The Proactive stopped working for me about 3 months into use. Unfortunately it took me years to muster up the nerve to give in and try spironolactone. I've never been one to take medications (even over the counter pain meds) so I just felt weird about it. But so far spironolactone has worked well. I've been on it about four months now and no signs of its effects wearing off (at least not yet). Might be something to discuss with your doctor? I feel like it's a good moderate treatment in between antibiotics and something more intense like Accutane. ,Thu Mar 22 02:12:18 2018

Definitely filaments.,Wed Mar 21 23:59:54 2018
It's sebaceous filaments definitely and unfortunately it's just genetics. People say buy products that can help "close pores" etc and they think they can essentially "shut" these, but you can't. However as long as you keep your face/pores clean and exfoliated they won't show up so bad.,Fri Mar 23 03:55:24 2018

 Wasn’t sure myself so I just switched to an FA Safe routine. Not only did my skin calm down, but I also fixed the moisture barrier since FA products are usually very basic and gentle. ,Wed Mar 21 17:12:47 2018
Looks like acne.  ,Wed Mar 21 23:57:50 2018
It is acne, you're skin is producing a lot of sebum you should use a cleanser made for oily skin, and a gentle exfoliate and use a small amount of tea tree oil.,Thu Mar 22 11:32:53 2018
whatever you do, do NOT use benzoyl peroxide gel. It takes the stretch away and I can only imagine what happens after. ,Fri Mar 23 05:23:31 2018
I think you should see a primary care doctor. Even if it’s not STD doesn’t necessarily mean acne. Could be something else. A primary care doctor would be more appropriate then a dermatologist for that part of the body. ,Sat Mar 24 00:13:17 2018
I'd go to visit derma again. Sounds tricky to treat at home. Good luck! ,Thu Mar 22 10:49:55 2018
Don't be embarrassed to tell a doctor-- they've seen EVERYTHING. Having that kind of infection on your penis sounds horrendous, and I don't even have one. Most doctors would feel very sympathetic I imagine.    

I had a weird breakout on my butt when I was in my early 20s. Turns out it was some kind of folliculitis that needed a hardcore antibiotic. Could be a fungal on your skin for all you know. Better to get it treated now than to have dark scars later.,Sat Mar 24 22:52:59 2018
Hello! First of all, i feel this. Very much. Sorry you’re going through it. I’m a 25 year old woman, but the worst acne phases I’ve been through are times I’m under high stress or not taking care of myself mentally and physically. Stress might be contributing, but sometimes you just have to be able to ride it out. The major thing I see here is picking. Even minor touching or picking my acne makes it erupt like none other. Try to keep your hands off your face at all costs. I recommend to only use a clean cloth to wash your face and never touch your face to put on product unless you’ve just washed your hands (I keep it by my sink and in my shower). Do not pop anything under all costs and grab some blister bandages (also called hydrocolloid bandages) at the drug store to cut up to put on open spots or spots with heads at night. 

Anyway, hope it gets better for you soon. I know it’s awful :(,Wed Mar 21 13:12:41 2018
My mindset is that Im still unattractive without acne.,Wed Mar 21 13:55:30 2018
I am very much a picker myself - if it's there I just can't help but fiddle with it.  One thing that I've used to help trick my brain into thinking I'm doing something about it, is using the COSRX Acne Pimple Master Patch (you can find some on amazon).  When I have a pimple that is 'pickable' I just put one of those bad boys on there and it helps remove gunk safely and reduce swelling.,Wed Mar 21 15:10:09 2018
I understand how you feel - I’m 20 and I too can’t help but pick at my acne and make it worse! Even when I’m picking, I’ll hear a little voice in the back of my head saying “stop it, you’ll regret this tomorrow”.

One thing that has really helped me, not physically with the spots, but mentally with dealing with them, is the mantra “those who mind don’t matter, and those who matter don’t mind”. You may think your skin is unattractive, but who really gives a shit? When you look at other people, you may notice they have acne, but do you care? Probably not. Everyone has flaws, and the people in your life who are really worth having significant relationships with will certainly not care about whether you have acne or not.

Another thing that has kinda helped me is that my boyfriend also has acne, but I often completely forget this because when I’m looking at his face I’m focusing on all the things I love about it, rather than on his “flaws”. So maybe we focus way too much on our own blemishes and imperfections when other people won’t notice and certainly won’t care as much.

I just remind myself that I'm not alone in this. Lots of people have it. When I see others with acne I don't think badly of them, so I expect that's the same way others see me. ,Wed Mar 21 19:51:11 2018
I “prime” them with salicylic acid or tretinoin, let that sit for a while, then put acnomel spot treatment on the spot. When I do this, they typically shrink or come to a head in about two days. Good luck. ,Wed Mar 21 18:35:59 2018
If they’re very very sore (and painful?), this sounds to me like cystic acne. Do they usually come to a head for you? Or is this new?
,Wed Mar 21 18:26:05 2018
Benzoyl peroxide, or calamine lotion as an overnight spot treatment work very well for me. ,Wed Mar 21 22:45:59 2018
These "cystic" pimples are the only kind I ever get. As soon I see the bump forming I know I'm on a tough next couple days. It's so frustrating because you can't so anything but wait, pop it and wait for scab to heal.

I'm pretty sure diet and balanced hormones are the only way to avoid them? ,Thu Mar 22 04:13:28 2018
I use small gauged needles used for medical injections to pierce them.  
Then I cut a small circle of hydrocolloid bandage and stick it on top of the pimple overnight.

All of my derms have described accutane as Plan Z for acne treatment. As in, it's the very last resort. But it's very effective, and chances are it cures your acne forever. In terms of making the personal decision to pursue accutane, I would say you have to be at the end of your rope regarding your tolerance of your acne and things you've tried. It seems like emotionally, you're there, but only you would know if you've really tried everything else. 

My dermatologist had me go on a "detox" for 3ish weeks to see if my lifestyle was the cause. During the three weeks, I ate only boiled vegetables and boiled chicken (no salt, sugar, dairy, gluten, additives, nothing), didn't use any skin care products or makeup, and drank a gallon of water a day. I was also tested to see if I had any deficiencies, allergies, or hormonal imbalances (I didnt). The fact that I still had new white heads and pustules coming up every day during those three weeks told my dermatologist that whatever it was causing my acne, it couldn't be fixed with a lifestyle change. I had also tried basically every skin care product imaginable before then. So I was at the end of my rope and I got on accutane. It's worked wonders, but I'm on a low dose so I have nearly no side effects. ,Wed Mar 21 22:06:55 2018
Hey there. I’m no expert by all means, but I completely understand the whirlwind you are going through right now.
First and foremost, if you ever have those thoughts and feel like talking to someone, you can PM me anytime or call this number 1-800-273-8255. If you have not heard the song Logic made about it, I also recommend this remedy as well. He’s a cheesy dude but he is really thinking outside the box with spreading peace, love, and positivity through his music. 
I do not know much about Accutane but I’ve heard of devastating side effects and it sounds like that is your biggest concern. Talk to your doctor and check out the other options and mention how it made you feel before. Treat accutane as a last resort to combat this battle, which eventually I know you will overcome with victory and self confidence.
Last thing I wanted to mention is - the skin is weird. I get terrible breakouts after I shave and also about 20 times a year I get very large and painful cysts on my neck and/or back. I have yet to resolve this problem, which is why I’m here with you on this beautiful thread. It’s a small community, but so many different people have posted success stories that have worked for them. Read them and think about your lifestyle as you read them. I saw a few crazy videos about Derry allergies that cause breakouts. This on top of oily foods or sugary foods can really do damage to your skin. Play around with diet and various cleansers, and always come back. 
Once you solve your problem, I want to hear the story :) ,Tue Mar 20 23:23:02 2018
Omg reading this post makes me feel really sad but I also feel so relatable. I’ve been suffering from hormonal adult acne and my skin never seem to clear up. Although it’s not cystic acne, I feel like I’ve lost my self confidence because I had to wear make up everyday to cover the acne scars. I’m so self conscious about my skin and there are times where I actually broke down because I just don’t know how to deal with my skin anymore. I hated the way I look without makeup because of my skin. I hate the texture, the pores, the scars, the redness, basically everything and I’ve reached that point in life where I just don’t wanna try anything again anymore. Just a week ago I tried a new skincare routine, nothing fancy, just stuff from The Ordinary, and drinking lots of water, and I can tell you that although my skin is far from perfect, it’s slightly getting a little bit better. I’m just saying that whatever it is, please don’t give up. We all have our own battles but at the end of the day, we just need to keep trying. This is easier said than done but I hope you’ll never give up. I wish you the best of luck in your road to clear skin. ,Wed Mar 21 02:14:27 2018
I know how u feel. But don give up. Everyone tells me it will get better!! :( ,Tue Mar 20 23:09:31 2018
Hey man - I have pretty bad acne and to be honest, it fucking sucks. But what I’ve began noticing is that people genuinely don’t care about - or even see - your acne. Everyone has issues and times can be rough but I promise that your acne is a much smaller deal to those around you than it would appear. 

That being said, I would go to a dermatologist and see what other treatments than Accutane they would recommend. ,Wed Mar 21 03:13:35 2018
I cried every night for 2 years after suffering from bad acne for 10 years. I was tired of everything. I was exhausted from asking people, they all said the same stuff. But here's my advice: it WILL get better. People don't have acne forever. Don't. Give. Up. You will find an answer. It's happening for a reason, you will find what's causing it and you will fix it. It's SO difficult, I know. I was done so many times. It took me giving up completely, fixing my weight and in-turn realize what was causing it all along, and it's a handful of things. You will find an answer, you can't give up yet. Take a break from worrying about it, then the answer will come to you. If you need it, I would love to offer support and minor guidance, I have a background in research and finding the causes behind things like this and am studying to be a health coach so this sort of thing is right up my alley. pm and we can chat if you're up for it. You got this!!! ,Wed Mar 21 04:25:30 2018
If you have the means to get on Accutane I recommend it. Trust me, when you weigh up the side effects (which on average are nowhere near as bad as the horror stories you've heard) and the psychological side effects of acne, the pill is the way to go. 

I have a history of depression (and in my family) and the pill did not make it worse for me. I just had slightly achey joints some days.

You deserve to be happy and have some self confidence. ,Thu Mar 22 04:21:28 2018
Can I ask if you're trying any dietary methods to clear acne? ,Wed Mar 21 10:07:56 2018
I have totally been there. There were days I refused to leave the house because I just felt like a disgusting monster. I felt like when people looked at me, all they saw was my acne. And I would tell myself people probably thought I was gross and unhygienic because of it. Even though when I saw people with acne, it wasn't a big deal. It was just me that I thought people were grossed out by. It really does something to your psyche. I will say, if you are having these thoughts already, Accutane can actually enhance or trigger suicidal thoughts so I would definitely talk to your doctor. I finally decided to give Spironolactone a try and that has been working pretty well. I didn't want to jump right into Accutane but I was going to if Spironolactone didn't work out. I'm 25 so I am fed up with this damn acne. I'm also planning on going to see an aesthetician regularly to get individualized facials. If you can afford it, I recommend you try that as well! I know we don't know each other, but I am here to talk if you ever need it. Just know that you're not alone in your struggle. ,Wed Mar 21 14:32:59 2018
I get these exact things, same places as you. I've tried looking it up but i couldn't really find any treatment info. 
I used to get your normal run-of-the-mill pustules but as I got older the acne kind of devolved into getting those "plugs" which aren't as bad but god I destroy my face pushing those out.,Wed Mar 21 03:34:34 2018

You can give exfoliating a try, just be sure that it’s a mild one, as you don’t want to irritate your skin. Also, changing pillow cases helps a ton! Aim to change them every week or so. As for your routine, personally I’d say wash your face twice a day. Once before bed and once after you get up.,Wed Mar 21 07:50:36 2018
[deleted],Wed Mar 21 08:23:58 2018
Adding an AHA or BHA is a great suggestion. There's some moisturizers that have glycolic acid in them to combine that into one step. You could also try adding a once a day usage of a 2.5% benzoyl peroxide treatment. ,Wed Mar 21 11:58:43 2018
I sleep with a clean towel over my pillow every night. It’s not as comfortable as a pillow case, which i sometimes miss, but i imagine it might help.

Would you say that you most often have no more than one whitehead?,Wed Mar 21 18:31:19 2018
Maybe Follicleanse Shampoo with Zinc. Zinc can help get rid of acne. ,Tue Mar 20 21:47:56 2018
The scalp is just skin, so if he can use it on his skin he probably won’t have a reaction on his head. However fifteen years is a very long time to hve a skin issue. Is there any possibility of a seeing a derm ? ,Tue Mar 20 22:17:19 2018
I personally recommend coal tar and salicylic acid combination shampoo and clean pillow cases at least twice a week.

I don't recommend it but I've seen benzoyl peroxide shampoo for dogs.,Tue Mar 20 23:16:27 2018
It may be folliculitis, not acne. I have it and it sucks. My dermatologist has dismissed my signs. I guess I will be trying Chlorhexidine shampoo soon.,Tue Mar 20 23:26:56 2018

I’ve been been using products with glycolic acid and my face has a completely different texture in just two weeks. My skin feels so much better. My pores look smaller.

Just got a round of fractionated CO2 laser done last week, actually. My scars definitely look better, a lot less red, a lot less deep. I’ve been getting so many compliments about how good my skin looks.

Don’t expect a miracle though. I had horrible scars before, and they’re less horrible now. I’m not gonna lie and tell you that I look like a porcelain doll. I maybe went from looking like a piece of blue cheese to feta cheese. You can definitely tell that  I still have scars, they’re just not as prominent as before. 

The procedure itself was PAINFUL. They numb you for about an hour before the procedure, and I had two layers of numbing cream put on me. I still felt it. It was worse than getting a tattoo. You can literally smell your skin burning. Afterward, you end up looking like someone shoved your face into a hot grill for a couple days, and your face HURTS, until your skin peels. 

Keep your face moisturized with aquaphor, which you will need to reapply multiple times a day, because your skin just eats it up. Then, as you peel, you start itching INTENSELY. Get some
Benadryl, because I could not sleep for two days due to the itch. 

My dermatologist says that I’ll continue to see improvement for a few months, and honesty, I’d gladly get the procedure done again. As long as your expectations are realistic, you’ll be happy.,Tue Mar 20 21:07:58 2018

I work in an office where our aesthetician can do profractional laser treatments and our physicians can do the full CO2 laser while the patient is under anesthesia. For the profractional laser, there are thousands of pinpoint areas targeted, but it is not the entire surface of skin. Patients have topical numbing cream and an occasional dental block, but it still smells like burning flesh in the office. The full CO2 laser takes off the whole layer of skin and the patient cannot feel any of it while under sedation. The results are much better after the latter treatment, but it is much more invasive. ,Tue Mar 20 23:56:14 2018
Some of it looks like scarring. Reminder- scarring is not your fault, just happens if you get acne. Try a Vitamin C serum. If that fails, micro needling or laser therapy can help. See a dermatologist for that. Also try adding a moisturiser to your routine! Nothing fancy, I like cetaphil everyday but another popular brand is cerave. 

Good luck!! ,Wed Mar 21 00:49:11 2018

I know this is not what you come here for, but from experience I can tell you that what you need most is to eat properly and drink tons of water. Yes you can follow the routine recommended to treat what’s already happening on your face but I would suggest staying away from sodas, saturated fats (anything deep fried, covered in grease etc) and would replace it with tons of water. There might be more to your skin imbalance than it might look so perhaps start there(?). I personally saw a HUGE improvement after i quit dairy and soda from my diet. Still working on drinking more water, though.

Looks like rosacea to me. Look up Metrogel and either get a prescription or find OTC women’s products with the same ingredients. Nutragena french milled soap 2x a day. Both of these cleared up my skin quickly. Good luck!,Wed Mar 21 02:08:12 2018

Do you wipe your mouth with your hand a lot? I’m really bad about touching my face and I often get acne only the areas I touch. I often find myself touching my mouth while sitting at my desk and so I struggle with blemishes around my lip line. ,Wed Mar 21 00:49:52 2018

It honestly could, depending on the person. Personally, I have to use face wash twice a day (day and night) to keep my acne at bay. However, I know a friend who treats his acne by showering twice (day and night), without facial cleanser and letting the shower water on his face. If it controls your acne, why the hell not? You actually "cleanse" it at night anyway and you cleanse it in the morning with water and the shower steam. You do you,Tue Mar 20 12:13:16 2018
Some people are better off rinsing their face once and washing it once a day. I rinse in the AM and use sunscreen and moisturizer. 

Edit: adding also to remember to rinse your face the last thing you do before you get out of the shower so you don't have shampoo on your face. ,Tue Mar 20 16:11:26 2018
Hi there, I’m an Esthetician. Water can be drying to the skin and doesn’t do much to actually help with your acne. You’d be better off finding a good cleanser with 2% salicylic acid and a moisturizer with spf for the daytime. Wash that off at night and apply a night moisturizer and eye cream. Professional grade products like Dermalogica are more concentrated and more effective, so you have to use less product. They’re more expensive but are better for your skin and will last you longer. Ulta is the only place aside from professional salons that sells Dermalogica.,Tue Mar 20 12:32:40 2018

Also want to know that how you guys use these gel - do you apply it on whole of face or on just pimple surface.
I have a lot of mild pimple around my face so what i do is I kind of apply it as a whole layer on my face.
Do suggest your opinions regarding that.,Tue Mar 20 14:56:55 2018

Do you use anything else currently, besides the moisturizer at night?  

I love my benzoyl peroxide products. I mix up my day and night routines between products that are gentle but have no "active" ingredients and products that actually do something to my skin.  

I would recommend starting with a simple routine, and building on it once it becomes a routine and not just products you use every now and then.  Find a gentle face cleanser that you like, the Simple brand has a nice gel cleanser that is affordable and should be easy to find.  You can use this day and night.  The benzoyl peroxide treatment I use is the Neutrogena On the Spot acne treatment, but I use it all over my face and just at night (benzoyl peroxide has preventative properties too).  A gentle moisturizer with sunscreen for during the day, and you can continue to use the same moisturizer that you have at night, or get one that has some glycolic acid in it too.

My favorite acne body wash is the Neutrogena Body Clear Body Scrub. I like it because if I use it regularly, it keeps my bacne at bay and I don't also have to remember to put another anti-acne treatment on my back.,Tue Mar 20 23:50:28 2018

Do you sweat a lot? Before working as a bartender, I worked on a ranch outside and would get sweaty through out the day, so I started bringing extra shirt so I could switch it out half way through the day. Then once I got home, I would hop in the shower and use a back scrubbed that I bought at target and wash my back in the shower. Once I got out of the shower, I would just spray a toner onto my back a few sprays and just put on a clean shirt for bed. It didn’t get rid of it completely, but it helped A LOT. Now that I bartend, I don’t change my shirt (except after going to the gym if I’m not going straight home) but I still do everything else the same. Hope it works out for you :),Tue Mar 20 02:00:24 2018
I started using this soap called Asphyxia (sp?) strictly on my back two weeks ago and it has drastically cleared my bacne. I have the moisturizing kind which is a godsend because i feel that my back is so dry once I get out of the shower and impossible to really moisturize, which I think contributes to the acne on my back. Give it a try! You can find it on Amazon.,Tue Mar 20 04:36:45 2018

Hi there, believe me I'm a victim of the worst acne/pimple. I experienced way heart breaking than that. Like my pimples was all over my face and not just a normal pimples, it has puss in them, every single one. And it really feels itchy. I even tried to dry them out with some kind of anti-pimple topical gels but they keep on coming back. It really breaks my heart. I wear mask when I go to school. I even eat at the cafeteria with my mouth mask on (it cover everything below my lower eyelids to the chin) I've been to dermatologist before. But the best thing they've given to me is an oral antibiotics. But it just last for 2 weeks, they can't prescribe it to me anymore coz maybe my body would be immune with it. I've experienced crying my self to sleep just because of my pimples. Im from the Philippines by the way. I have oily skin. The only thing that helped me is a food supplement name "MX3". I drink 2 capsules a day for two months and once for maintenance. I choose this coz i know for myself that I can't be a healthy eater. It really made a difference. I SWEAR. And I exfoliate my face using "maxi-peel", for starters, use it for straight 2 months and use sunscreen coz your face will became very sensitive with sunlight and would start peeling. 


But if you are just having a problem with that part of your face and not the whole face, i could still suggest the MX3 Capsule, and just moisturize. Coz i find it really dry. Don't try to dry up your face just to get rid of pimples dear. Been there, done that, but doesn't really helped me in solving my acne problem.,Tue Mar 20 10:51:43 2018

Have you tried altering your diet? Cut out dairy and gluten for a few weeks and see if that helps. If you don’t notice any changes then you could also try eliminating eggs, nuts, sugar, coffee, and caffeine (i.e. the top food allergens). Also, as far as supplements are concerned, vitamin D, zinc, NAC, l-lysine, and fish oil are all supposed to be very helpful for acne. ,Tue Mar 20 01:31:36 2018
Don’t worry I had really bad acne in high school and I still do but not as much in college now. One thing my dad told me was it’s normal to see teenagers with acne, just like it is to see old people with wrinkly faces. The fact is everyone including adults know how hard acne can be on people and plus many adults know what you are going through because trust me they probably been through it as well. ,Tue Mar 20 03:00:30 2018
I’m 20 and Im also struggling like the way you did back in school.

But hey, if it helps, it takes time but I dont hate myself as much anymore. ,Tue Mar 20 03:47:19 2018
What's your current routine besides the differin? As far as picking your face, it will only lead to more discoloration and scarring, j know it's hard but that's only going to make it worse. ,Tue Mar 20 08:34:29 2018
I know what you mean, I was in the same boat. It was bad enough that I legitimately considered going on accutane, but decided not to because of all the negative side affects and health risks. 
I’ve been using the Paula’s Choice extra strength acne kit and it’s helped wonders in a surprisingly short amount of time. Maybe that could be a good option for you? I went from having more pimples than skin to only 5 small ones. ,Tue Mar 20 09:24:48 2018
Please now that you are not alone. Acne is a b*tch. We all hate it. 
If you can see a doctor, ask him/her about cod liver oil. I hope you get rid of this sooner than you think. ,Tue Mar 20 14:50:39 2018
I can’t tell if that salicylic acid product is a face wash or a spot treatment. If it’s a wash, then I suggest removing your gentle cleanser as using those 2 together will strip your skin of oil. If it’s a spot treatment, then apply it after cleansing to any areas with acne. Salicylic acid does NOT kill bacteria, it just chemically exfoliates and unclogs your pores. As you mentioned you have whiteheads, I suggest using a product that contains either tea tree oil or benzoyl peroxide, as you get whiteheads from bacteria and those ingredients kill bacteria. I don’t have any experience with rosehip oil so I can’t talk about that, I suggest doing research on that. Also don’t pop ur pimples as those marks can take YEARS to fade, even with products to help with that. For you, if your acne is moderate to severe, I suggest using a salicylic acid face wash, followed by a tea tree oil or benzoyl peroxide spot treatment, and then followed by a light weight moisturizer that specially says it’s non comedogenic/won’t clog pores. Feel free to reply to this post or PM me with any further questions :) 

UPDATE: After doing some research, I found that many people had great experiences with rosehip oil for their acne scars,Mon Mar 19 20:42:31 2018
Are you using the salicylic acid  on current breakouts or just the old scars? The rose hip oil is good for moisturizing, but I would put other treatments in your routine to lighten the scars. Vitamin C is a great start. I had some scarring on my chin and vitamin c serum combined with at home chemical peels, they greatly reduced the redness and the scars. It depends on what type is scarring you have? ,Tue Mar 20 08:00:13 2018
I haven’t tried it yet but my derm told me to use it as a spot treatment for now. She said if I rub it on a spot and wait about 15 minutes, the spot treatment I use next will be able to penatrate the skin better.  Sounds reasonable but like I said I haven’t tried it yet. I use acnomel as a spot treatment currently. For me it works a lot better than bp but doesn’t dry my skin out as bad. ,Mon Mar 19 23:26:11 2018

Yes same!!! I don’t have acne as much but I do have lots of hyper pigmentation, and it sucks but I guess it’s better than having acne right ?,Mon Mar 19 11:52:12 2018
alpha hydroxy acids (ahas) did really well with lightening my hyperpigmentation. I’m 16 as well and had the same problem with no idea how to fix it. TO glycolic acid toning solution really helped my skin, but for something more gentle the FAB facial radiance pads won’t dry out your skin as much. do some research on the ordinary because there are a lot of different ahas (lactic acid 5% or 10%, glycolic acid) and theres also the AHA BHA peeling solution I think it’s called but I can’t get it in canada but many people love it. A more easily accessible one is pixi glow tonic, which is loved by a lot a lot a lot of people 😂. do your research on AHAs because there are a lot of options,Mon Mar 19 12:30:40 2018
Same,Mon Mar 19 11:02:13 2018
You can a skin whitning product to even out texture.,Mon Mar 19 12:17:49 2018
I used to get this a lot when shaving and would even use the bump stopper product to reduce the razor burn. What worked for me was switching from the "how many blades can we put on this thing" model of razor and switching to an old school safety razor. I bought the Merkur long handle off Amazon. For me irritation greatly reduced and it is a lot cheaper as well. Also, a really good product for lather. I found shave soaps and lubricants worked a lot better for nonirratation versus the stuff that comes out of the can. And I use witch hazel and later moisturizer instead of an after shave. Sorry for the rant but hopes something here helps.,Mon Mar 19 17:01:27 2018
I agree with using a straight razor. Cheaper in the long run. 

You can also try a sugar scrub before and after shaving. Depending on your skin sensitivity it might be good to get a scrub with some kind of oil(jojoba, shea). I would reccomend using alcohol or an alcohol based product(like aftershave) afterward to close the pores and sterilize your skin. ,Mon Mar 19 19:57:35 2018
Shaving against the grain is always the best way to avoid getting razor bumps. I recommend going to Walmart and upgrading to an electric razor to prevent razor bumps.,Mon Mar 19 15:24:43 2018
I switched to an electric razor and no longer get bumps unless I cut myself. ,Mon Mar 19 21:14:22 2018
Meats that contain nitrates such as salami, bacon, sausage are on the avoid list on some acne diets but lean, organic proteins that don't contain hormones should be fine.,Mon Mar 19 15:09:56 2018
No. If you're really worried, stick to lean meats like Turkey, chicken, etc. But honestly, if it's decent meat, there should be no problems. ,Mon Mar 19 15:20:56 2018
I’ve been vegetarian for about a year. I occasionally consume dairy, like cheese or eggs. I’ve always struggled with acne mainly on my cheeks, but when I stopped eating meat I no longer have bad acne or break outs. I may occasionally get a very small pimple but nothing like before, and people have asked me what I did differently for my face to clear up. Now I just struggle with a bad complexion and acne scars. So in my case, yes meat can cause acne. But I’d also keep a limit on dairy ,Tue Mar 20 01:17:22 2018
It might be the dairy more than anything. I experimented with my diet over 2-3 week increments various times and found a decrease in dairy consumption made my acne flare up less. It's important to incorporate a face washing routine as well, but dairy is usually the place to start if you want to begin changing your diet.,Mon Mar 19 17:12:44 2018

Hey man, the same thing happened to me. I went vegan and juiced a lot of vegetables. I also take a lot of Vitamin C. Currently I would say I am 90% clearer than I was before. It took a long time to see results though, probably 9-10 months is where I turned a corner. Feel free to PM me if you want to chat. ,Mon Mar 19 17:48:27 2018
Not exactly in the same boat but maybe try fish oil. I have been using it to fight off breakouts for a while now. It doesn’t prevent them completely but helps them to clear up much faster. Typically if I have a breakout I will take 2 capsules about 3 or 4 times a day with meals if possible. On other days I do maybe 2 a day. ,Thu Mar 22 12:55:43 2018
Tell your doctor. I had to go through two rounds of Accutane.  
I still get acne, but it’s minor and not as bad as it used to be. Rarely get it so bad that I don’t want to leave the house. ,Sat Mar 24 12:04:53 2018

“Bimples” is killing me. At least you have a sense of humor about it! Is it possible to switch to a standing desk?,Sun Mar 18 22:40:40 2018
I started getting horrible buttne from working out- so i went to the derm and its not acne but folliculitus. I had to get prescribed acne neds for it tho and it works. The dark spots and scars take forever to fade which is what I am working on now. Dont worry its actually really common,it doesnt matter how clean you are, but try to not wear tight clothes where you build up sweat.,Sun Mar 18 23:20:38 2018
You could try the standard benzoyl peroxide spot treatment and/or stridex after you shower. That way, the medicine can stay on your skin for longer.  Also try to wear cotton underwear so your skin can breathe.

If the above doesn't work, it could be fungal acne/folliculitis, in which case washing with Head & Shoulders might work.,Mon Mar 19 01:45:43 2018
If it’s over the course of a day, it could be an allergic reaction, but it’s hard to say. ,Mon Mar 19 20:05:47 2018

Bumps* sorry!,Mon Mar 19 09:52:35 2018
I know exactly how you feel. I can't stand it. I am in my senior year of high school and I'm a girl with moderate acne on my cheeks. Everyone in my classes have perfect skin and I'm sitting here with a pizza face. One time a boy told me I should put lotion on my face. I have no confidence when it comes to boys. I am 5'11" and I already stand out. The acne on my cheeks just makes it even worse. I hate it. I deleted Instagram because I couldn't stand seeing all the popular girls with their clear skin at the beach or hanging out together. I will never be like the popular girls who are petite with beautiful skin. They can go out tanning meanwhile I can't leave the house without sunblock on because I don't want to worsen my hyperpigmentation. I feel for you so badly. Your post made me realize my frustration. We will pull through and have glowing skin one day. Much love to you. ,Sun Mar 18 10:28:24 2018
My boyfriend will have Dr. Oz on with these people that have these awful skin diseases and be like, “Babe, now *that* is terrible. Yours is no where near that bad!”

And I’m just like “ oh okay I feel so much better now!” Haha. ,Sun Mar 18 13:43:08 2018
I feel this so much. Sometimes I just want to say "my skin looks like shit" and have someone look at me and be like "you're right. It looks like shit." It wouldn't feel good, but I'd sure as hell like to hear that over the "oh no your skin looks fine!" ,Sun Mar 18 17:21:39 2018
Why bring it up? Of course they’ll say it’s fine. As a mod/severe acne sufferer myself, I’ve learned to try my best to ignore my acne because it does hold us back in terms of self esteem and overall happiness. The one thing I still can’t get over is doing outside activities where I’m sure everyone is staring at my cakey foundation and awful texture.

It will probably subside somehow, someday.

And even if it doesn’t just remind yourself that it is just ONE part of you. You are not ugly or inferior by default due to acne. Not at all. Everyone has something they hate about themselves and honestly they’re so caught up in their own insecurities that they probably hardly notice ours.

It’s gonna be alright.,Sun Mar 18 17:57:06 2018
After reading these posts I relate to all of you on so many levels. My cystic acne broke out when I was in middle school, before everyone else had their break outs, and I was so self conscious about it. I used to blame my acne on why boys in high school were never interested in me. My friends were the same way, they said my skin wasn’t that bad...they just could never relate. I spent so much money and time on prescription topical creams and oral medications that my night routine would take 15-20 minutes. Insanity! Sadly, my skin didn’t start to improve until I was in undergrad. Now, even being 26, I still suffer with adult acne that gets pretty bad at times. It’s about finding what works for you and hormones are NEVER the best friends for us with difficult skin 😞,Sun Mar 18 20:19:54 2018
I totally get it... but to be honest even now that my skin is clear as an adult, there is always something about my appearance that I dislike. ,Sat Mar 24 12:06:20 2018
Did you change your soap in the last few days? As the comment above mine mentions, try tea tree oil baths. I also recommend African Black soap. Someone i know used it for their eczema and it helped clear their skin. ,Sun Mar 18 21:07:37 2018
Also, grab some ceraVE body wash. It’s non-comodemic and cleared up my shoulders they used to be horrible they would hurt so bad !,Sun Mar 18 22:44:55 2018

This looks like it might be an allergy. Have you ever been allergy tested for various food intolerances?,Sun Mar 18 23:51:56 2018
If this happened over the course of a couple days, this could be a product issue.  When you have pustules or red papules like this, this means it is a bacterial issue.  When they are flesh colored bumps, it usually means it is congestion and it is a desquamation issue.  The bacteria that usually causes this is called propionibacterium acnes.  In order to reduce the amount of this bacteria, you need to use an acidic cleanser that contains AHA and BHA (Alpha Hydroxy Acid and Beta Hydroxy Acid) .  Look for a cleanser that has Glycolic Acid and Salicylic Acid.  Using soap or fragranced body wash such as Axe, or Old Spice with heavy Fragrances can be comedogenic (can clog the pores).   After you wash with an acidic cleanser, use an exfoliating towel to scrub off the dead skin.  After you get out of the shower, apply a spot treatment contains both Salicylic Acid and Benzoyl Peroxide (if your skin can tolerate it) .  Avoid wearing shirts that don't breathe, and if you perspire a lot, try not to stay in the same clothes.  If you are still getting break outs, you may need a professional back facial and then follow the protocol the service provider recommends.  Good luck! ,Mon Mar 19 00:48:42 2018
Try tea tree oil baths! ,Sun Mar 18 20:57:51 2018
I know how to heal it to avoid scars at least- 

Use Dudu Osun Black African soap AFTER you shampoo your hair (sometimes shampoo and conditioner left on back skin causes break outs)
Pat skin dry
Apply Cos RX BHA, let it dry 
Apply Seoul Ceuticals Vit C Ferulic Acid and E serum or equivalent to aid with brightening and scar prevention (it also fixes your skin barrier) 
Let dry 

Snail creams (I love Mizon) are good to heal skin as it heals btw ❤️,Sun Mar 18 23:31:52 2018
Accutane,Mon Mar 19 03:56:28 2018
I got healed by using ketoconazole & zinc lotion. For allergy control use Air Tab FX. PS: Not a doctor. Stop using any lotion/soap immediately. Change vests twice a day. ,Mon Mar 19 08:56:06 2018
DIY at home? nope. tried numerous times and never saw a difference. i did two sessions at the dermatologist where they used a derma pen which has needles that go a lot deeper and requires numbing cream, but the results are a lot better than DIY dermrolling ,Sun Mar 18 22:31:48 2018
I had microneedling done and my skin looked great for a month and then back to normal. I have rough skin and scarred pores.  I went in for another session and the rn shrugged and said cells turn over every month and I would not see any long term results. I appreciated her honesty but now what..,Wed Mar 21 22:57:37 2018
I think it depends on what you’re able to handle as far as pain tolerance because depending on how deep your scars are is going to be how big the needles will need to be to really penetrate them.. I use 1mm and I bleed but nothing insane and my scaring is significantly better but I didn’t have horrible scaring to begin with it was bad but not horrible I mostly have some indentations and pigmentation issues and I use it for fine lines.. I’ve seen great results from that size and if I ever decided to penetrate deeper or get a bigger sized needle I’d need to buy some numbing cream because this is about as far as my self inflicting pain tolerance can handle! I personally think it’s the holly grail of skin care but consistency and post care are so important. ,Thu Mar 22 03:46:35 2018
Owndoc it’s an online store it has a ton of info and people talking about derma rolling plus super excellent quality rollers ,Thu Mar 22 12:21:13 2018
I wouldn’t use anything that makes my skin burn. Your moisture barrier could be damaged. Get that in check first before using those, and also look at moisturizing before and after you apply those gels if not indicated otherwise ,Mon Mar 19 05:53:24 2018
Hi! I had a really similar experience: a lot of acne when at college and almost none when I go back home. What I've done is basically avoid getting my face wet. I know. It sounds crazy, but I have actually gotten used to it and my skin has DEFINITELY improved! I used to get these massive white heads on my face a lot, but it's died down since I stopped using water. I now use simple skincare dry skin micellar water to cleanse my face once a day at night.

I hope that helped!,Sun Mar 18 21:10:15 2018
I experienced huge breakouts because of the water quality when I was in college. I ended up just not letting the water touch my face, and using wipes/micellar water to wash my face after showering. Some of my roomies would buy a gallon of purified water a week to use to splash their face - seemed kind of excessive but it worked. 

While the water might be a factor, could it also be your boyfriend/his bed? When I didn't live with my SO, I would break out after visiting him because I would snuggle into his chest and he would sweat almost straight into my pores lol. It's a nasty visual but that's really what happened. I would make him put on a clean tshirt for bed and also be sure to wash my face after snuggling and not fall asleep on him, which helped immensely. Similar to you, I would bring my own pillowcases because I change mine every other day at home. Good luck!!!,Mon Mar 19 12:44:05 2018
Ok um hi I have the same problem with literally ALL the moisturizers. The only one I’ve found that doesn’t do this to me is the Pond’s moisturizer, the one with the light blue cap. I can’t remember the exact name, but there’s only one that is light blue!,Mon Mar 19 00:16:45 2018
It could be the facewash, sometimes "oil-control" cleansers can be very drying. And contrary to popular belief dryness and oiliness can go hand in hand especially when your moisture barrier is damaged. If you are not looking to change products or routine then idk. But I would recommend a more hydrating cleanser, and then possibly adding a couple drops of pure plant-based squalane oil to your moisturizer (or on top of it) daily. It's non-comedogenic, non-greasy, absorbs quickly and can also be used on the lips.,Sun Mar 18 17:47:15 2018
Hey, I'm sorry to hear that! (yes I'm from the other thread LOL but I got curious and wanted to help you out)... I recommend using plant-based moisturizers, such as shea butter, jojoba oil (which is actually a liquid wax, not an oil), castor oil, etc... I have eczema and psoriasis, so I have to be very mindful when it comes to using skin care products. The less, the better. Bonus: Rose water spray is the best when you need a quick refresher! ,Thu Mar 22 21:57:23 2018
It’s 40 mg doxycycline capsules. Doxycycline works well to clear up infection while topical treatments start to work. I’m sure your doctor already said this, but you don’t want to be on it for longer than a month or so. ,Sun Mar 18 20:31:11 2018
So, I am using tetracycline for two weeks now, and my skin just get worst, my dermatologist said that if this does not work, I'm gonna take isotratinoin.

Just hoping for the best :(,Sun Mar 18 18:48:22 2018

For the winter months I would highly recommend the HEMP face protector from The Body Shop. 

I use Benzaclin for my acne and it really dries out my skin to the point where it feels like a race I'm constantly losing when trying to give my skin back some moisture. However, I started using this HEMP Face Protector cream and it has changed the game entirely for me. I have oily skin and I find that right now this doesn't make it worse at all, however for the summer months I might change to a lighter moisturizer! But for the winter months this might be a good choice for you if you live somewhere with a winter season. ,Sun Mar 18 12:14:11 2018

I am eighteen years old and a senior in high school, what a coincidence I too am on Spironolactone right now and have little baby cysts on my chin. I have one question: How many weeks are you into Spirnolactone? If you started it recently it might be a purging phase.  

Edit: I know how you feel. About two weeks ago I had a cyst on my chin and it was so inflamed that my bottom lip was lopsided, you know what else happened. I had to go to the orthodontist too. The most embarrassing thing ever was trying them putting new elastics on my bottom teeth because my lip kept covering them. ,Sun Mar 18 07:44:49 2018
I’m on it too! I also went through the purging phase and I cried every day through it but I read that it was so common that I stayed hopeful. I’m nearing two months now and my skin is over the purge phase and SLIGHTLY better so I’m starting to see the light lol. Stay strong! It’ll get better!!,Sun Mar 18 11:18:18 2018
I am on both aczone and spironolactone as well. I’ve taken it before in the past (with tazorac) and it cleared up my skin so wonderfully. Unfortunately my acne came back so I’ve been taking it again and I’m already seeing huge results 1.5 months in. But it was reeeeeeally bad for a while. It sounds like you’re having a lot of pain because the acne is in areas that move whenever you open your mouth or lift your eyebrows. The only thing that helped me with the pain was to eat smaller bites of food, so I wouldn’t have to open my mouth so wide. Also using a benzoyl peroxide face mask everyday (I use neutrogena clear pore wash/mask, it’s 2.5% benzoyl peroxide I believe.) 

Is your skin cracking at all? Or is the pain from the cysts themselves? ,Sun Mar 18 17:00:27 2018

It looks like it's hormonal acne. You said you've tried contraceptive pills? The best one for acne would be Dianette or Yasmin depending on your country. 
However, if you don't want to go on the pill for any reason you could maybe at least manage your acne with a topical retinoid. Differin does take time but I've really noticed a difference in the texture of my skin. ,Sun Mar 18 06:37:43 2018
I get these too. I assumed they were hormonal/stress related and I just had to suck it up. I have the copper IUD so I'm not on any hormones besides whatever my body does and I don't know how to clear them. I also have one on my chin that will take weeks to clear, and will leave a nice purple scar even though I don't pick at it 🙃

I’ve stayed away from oils ever since I got bad CCs from when I tried OCM (grapeseed, rosehip and tamanu). Took forever to clear them and they all turned into either pustules, papules or cystic zits.

I’m so hesitant on trying it again (I finally got an all right routine going for me). 

But maybe I’ll come around to it soon. Imma just save this post for if/when that day comes. Thanks for experimenting and sharing your experience.,Sun Mar 18 00:27:08 2018

For the average and very lucky person, a halt in acne production usually follows a decrease, or regulation, in hormone production, typically sometime after puberty.

Unfortunately, for alot of the people in this sub that is not the case, to which I would suggest diet may be playing a large role in your skin's health, and/or perhaps stress and other lifestyle related issues.,Sat Mar 17 11:19:49 2018

I hated Tactupump and it did nothing for me. But if BP works for you, you might like it. I’m on minocycline now, and it’s definitely keeping my IB from Retin A under control. Make sure you’re taking a probiotic a few hours before or after. You need to take probiotics with antibiotics but they should be a few hours apart so they don’t interfere. If you’re female, you’ll likely get yeast infections. The probiotics will help, but tea tree oil baths can help externally ,Sat Mar 17 11:55:48 2018
I’ve tried tactupump and t didn’t do much other then burn my face, I pretty much just stopped using it and went back to over the counter medicated overnight cream. I personally used a neutragena over night cream with benzoyl peroxide every night until my face started to feel irritated and then I stopped for a couple of days. I’m currently on my second day of doxycycline which I’m pretty sure is closely related to minocycline and I’ve heard good things about it. But I would be careful with the tactupump because it also drys your skin out a lot.,Sun Mar 18 12:54:58 2018
I know exactly how you feel. One cheap solution you could try for acne scars is Rosehip Oil. You can get good 100% rosehip oil from Amazon or The Ordinary. If you have oily skin, use it at night instead of in the day so the shininess won’t bother you as much.,Sat Mar 17 20:24:45 2018

yeah i'd say warmer water is fine as long as you don't let it run for too long over your problem areas and moisturize afterward!,Sat Mar 24 13:14:08 2018
Since you use AHA at morning you *have to* use sunscreen because it makes skin photosensitive. Adding toner is totally ok too as someone else suggested. ,Sat Mar 17 05:37:23 2018
How long have you been on this routine? 

Adding a witch hazel toner to your routine should be fine, make sure you let it dry completely before moving on to your next step. 
Just to be safe I would alternate the days you use tretinoin and benzoyl peroxid. Don't use them together until you've consulted with your doctor or at the very, VERY least done a patch test to see how using both would react on your skin.


**edit**


For hyperpigmentation I would suggest adding a few drops of rosehip oil (one or two max) to your moisturizer to start (since you're worried about too many products). This will also help your skin recover if you have any sort of dryness and irritation as a result of your acne treatments. ,Fri Mar 16 23:38:56 2018

Hydrocortisone!! I’ve been trying all sorts on my acne cysts for 20 years and finally, after seeing my new favourite dermatologist and being told that some simple OTC hydrocortisone will calm down the redness and swelling (and trying it!), mind = blown!!
(She also prescribed Retin-A to actually treat them but that takes weeks; the hydrocortisone was instant).,Sat Mar 17 01:30:25 2018
Hi there, maybe ask your doc for Retin-a prescription. If you have a lot of little bumps then you want a cream that will be a gentle chemical exfoliation of your pores. Breakouts heal must faster with Retin-a because it accelerates cell turnover.,Fri Mar 16 22:23:14 2018
not about what you were prescribed, but do you have bangs? long hair that touches your shoulders/back? ,Fri Mar 16 21:03:32 2018
Do you have skincare routine to treat your skin? Those gels may be drying and acne skin needs moisture too. I've had acne meds too and only afterwards I noticed that moisturizing more would've made my suffering back then easier lol. Check a blog called  "simple skincare science",Sat Mar 17 05:49:20 2018
Are you referring to duac gel? That stuff works awesome but it is temporary. Then again it will take about 6 months for your hormones to regulate after going off of birth control so it might be a good solution while you wait it out.. Do yourself a favor and stay off of birth control if you can. ,Wed Mar 21 00:27:28 2018
I always moisturize last, I have had topicals from my doctor and put them on right after washing my face, let it dry, then use moisturizer. I have never had tretinoin so I don’t know how different it is ,Fri Mar 16 20:36:56 2018
Usually oily skin is dry and needs light moisture. So it'd be good to moisture both morning and night, since tretinoin etc can be drying. (Just my guess tho.) So maybe cleansing- acne creams - moisture would be good to start with. Check a blog called "simple skincare science" too. ,Sat Mar 17 05:43:47 2018
I’ve got those pimple squeezing tools that make the work a lot easier and I apply anti bacterial gel to the area immediately afterward. I rarely wait for whiteheads because scarring is not so much an issue.,Fri Mar 16 12:59:22 2018
I squeeze. Can’t help myself, especially once a cyst FINALLY comes to a head after weeks of waiting. My personal rule of thumb is once you see ANY blood, STOP. I haven’t scarred. ,Fri Mar 16 19:23:47 2018
In addition to potential scarring, popping pimples can make them worse by increasing the inflammation in that area. You can rupture the inner lining of your pore, introducing the bacteria in the acne pore into neighboring pores. Don't use sharp (or dirty) fingernails and don't squeeze too hard, if you're gentle it can help the pore drain and not cause too many other problems. Definitely use an acne treatment too. ,Fri Mar 16 14:28:21 2018
If you really feel you must  pop, do not squeeze and rupture skin with force or fingers. Clean your hands and skin, use a few cotton pads and put fingers on either side.  With very very gentle pressure, push down very slightly. Don't push towards the fingers as you can create scars, which is a good reason not to. ,Fri Mar 16 14:04:13 2018

Hey OP, I'm sorry you're feeling this way. Please reach out to a suicide hotline if you need immediate help and see a doctor about these feelings as soon as you can. I hope things get better for you and I sincerely hope you don't hurt yourself. ,Fri Mar 16 00:16:02 2018
It won’t last forever, what really matters is how you see yourself on the inside. That’s what makes you a human. I hope things get better for you, and will send positive thoughts your way! ,Fri Mar 16 01:18:29 2018
Hang in there, I'm in the exact same position. 21, been dealing with this since I was 14. So trust me when I say that I know how shit it feels. One day we'll have perfectly clear skin and we'll look back at this time and laugh. My heart goes out to you, if you ever need to talk I'm here. ,Fri Mar 16 12:42:46 2018
I was the exact same way when I was 21. I had cystic acne and hated my face so much I stopped leaving my apartment. I was severely depressed from it as well.

Now I’m 31 and have almost no acne. When I tell people that I used to have horrible acne they tend to be shocked. 

When I was 21 I felt like I had tried everything and I never thought my face would actually ever clear up. 

Hang in there. It gets better.,Fri Mar 16 22:59:37 2018

What did you do to your diet? It took me 2 years of playing around with my diet before I got to a diet that completely healed my skin.

If you have any questions Id be more than happy to help!,Fri Mar 16 20:41:07 2018
Try drinking peppermint tea ☕️. It’s good for hormonal acne.,Fri Mar 16 21:42:11 2018
There is hope for you! I would seek out a reputable naturopath that can help you diagnose your cause of inflammation. It could be food allergies, enzyme deficiencies, yeast overgrowth, mold toxicity, insulin resistance.. dermatologists rarely if ever seek to diagnose the root cause but a good naturopath could help! ,Wed Mar 21 00:37:27 2018
Please don’t start Mirena. I have heard a lot of horror stories and if you’re acne prone, it just isn’t worth the risk. You could look into non hormonal methods of birth control such as the copper IUD.,Fri Mar 16 13:46:11 2018
This routine doesn't promote or prevent acne. If you wanted an anti-acne boost, you could use a benzoyl peroxide dash wash at night, or a 2.5% benzoyl peroxide treatment at night. Since you're not acne prone, that might be too much and a daily moisturizer with salicylic acid or glycolic acid may be enough extra exfoliation to keep acne from forming. ,Fri Mar 16 14:21:49 2018
You can’t really prevent hormonal acne with a routine, based on my knowledge. I get cystic hormonal acne monthly because of my period. The reason you get hormonal acne is because androgens like testosterone increase at a certain point in your menstrual cycle (I think just before your period starts.) The androgens increase the production of sebum(oil)  which can lead to blocked pores and hence, acne. The problem with hormonal acne, or mine in particular, is that it starts super deep within the skin. Topical produces like creams, ointments, or cleansers work at the surface so they have little impact. I’m not sure how hormonal levels change with the insertion of an iud, but this is what I know about it based on my own experiences. I have to treat my acne with, ironically, birth control. It’s a different kind than what you’re planning to use, though. Hormonal acne is typically treated with specific birth control pills that regulate the production of androgens. ,Fri Mar 16 14:57:26 2018
You WILL BE FINE on the mirena IUD. Yes its hormonal bc but most of the hormone stays localised in the uterus, some may enter the blood stream and circulate but at much lower amounts than what you get by taking oral contraceptive. Everyone reacts differently, I have had the mirena for 2 years now and it hasn't caused any problems. I was previously on Ginet 84 which is awesome for skin (but not so much your body)on, so coming off that I did have a wee adjustment period but nothing major. 

The main change I would make is remove the coconut oil from your routine, it sucks for skin and I have no idea how it got so trendy. If you would like an oil go for something like rosehip oil or argan oil. For a more occlusive oil squalene is good to help seal in moisture. 

,Fri Mar 16 15:34:25 2018
don't put coconut oil on ur skin,Fri Mar 16 14:22:20 2018
I'm also have problem with acne on my face. Should I use tretinoin to treat it? Any side effects. Sorry I'm not good at English. I really appreciate your help!
,Sat Mar 17 01:16:51 2018
I would get your hormones tested, see if you can rule that out. It sounds like you’re taking really good care of your health and skin. That’s what makes me think it could be related to hormones, especially because it’s out of the blue and it’s origin is confusing. I hope you find answers! ,Fri Mar 16 00:46:15 2018
You’re getting acne because you’re a puberty aged male and your hormones are so out of whack. Keep using the products that work for your skin and keep drinking water - that’s really all you can do,Thu Mar 15 20:49:15 2018
It could be hormonal. It's not unusual for teenagers to get hormonal acne. You can also look into using things other than salicylic acid for acne  like benzoyl peroxide or differin.  You can also tell your doctor about it and they can refer you to a dermatologist or they can prescribe a topical antibiotic or medication themselves( that's what my doctor did)

I am not an expert on male acne however when my husband gets acne its on his chin and  because of his beard. So get a gentle exfoliator and try using that and also get a moisturizer.  When you clean you face you remove impurities but if you skin gets go dry it will crack and cause acne. ,Fri Mar 16 19:46:48 2018
I'd lance it, put a hydrocolloid bandage on it over night (or all day if you have no shame like myself) and then after the bandage is done sucking all of the gunk out of it, use either the clindamycin or BP.,Thu Mar 15 17:19:53 2018
Out of all the products you listed, Benozyl Peroxide would be your best bet. If it's during the day and you want to be discrete. I would just dab a little bit of 90% Isopropyl Alcohol to dry it out. PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU ONLY DAB A LITTLE. ALSO, TEST A DAB OF THE ALCOHOL ON YOUR ARM OR LEG TO MAKE SURE YOU WON'T GET AN ALLERGIC REACTION OR INCREASED REDNESS. And that's pretty much it.,Thu Mar 15 17:55:01 2018
My friend was traveling in asia for a while and when she got back in north america she started breaking out again. For her it was the added sugar everywhere so she tried to eat less bread/pasta/pastries and it worked for her. Cutting dairy also helps. Try to find the differences in your diet when you were there and when you are in america. ,Thu Mar 15 12:56:30 2018
I feel you there, my skin got angry during my study exchange. Different climate, food and more pollution.
Try double cleansing your face, maybe it could help a little?,Thu Mar 15 17:00:35 2018
Amazing results ,Tue Mar 13 21:13:21 2018
Scars?! Girl WHERE. You look amazing. So happy for you. I’m on week 2 of tretinoin... praying for results like yours ,Tue Mar 13 22:05:20 2018
Looks amazing!!! You hardly have any scars! I had  similar, maybe a little more scarring than you and I’ve been getting microdermabrasion facials regularly and now they are gone, highly recommend it. Great job!!,Wed Mar 14 00:49:27 2018
That's amazing! I'm so glad you posted this because I have the same kind of acne and I'm wondering about scaring myself ,Tue Mar 13 21:31:52 2018
I am amazed at this transformation!! I’ve been on tretinoin for about 6 months now and wow the difference it has made for my skin! I had a lot of those comedones all over my forehead temples and chin and it’s all gone now. I cried when i noticed it start actually working. Ive struggled with all different types of acne since i was like 12 years old. So going to the dermatologist and figuring out wtf is wrong with my skin and the treatment actually working was amazing. I’m so glad there are so many people benefiting from tretinoin too!!,Tue Mar 13 22:49:40 2018
I literally said out loud “daaaaamn” when I saw this, talk about a stunning before and after! You look like a completely different person I’ve never seen one this dramatic 👍🏻,Tue Mar 13 22:21:46 2018
Hot DAMN. Girl look at you! That is absolutely amazing!,Tue Mar 13 23:21:03 2018
Wow this is seriously amazing. I know you want help with acne scars, but you have been seriously blessed with fast-healing skin because I don't see any! Congratulations on you awesome results. Your dermatologist should use this before and after for their website to show potential patients that miracles can happen,Wed Mar 14 11:43:36 2018
There’s a reason tretinoin is prescribed as much as it is for acne, and I’m so glad it was prescribed for you, as it seems to have truly transformed your skin. 👍 I don’t have too much experience myself with scar treatments, but two things I do which are highly recommended are daily sunscreen application to prevent any scars/spots from darkening and then exfoliation. Tretinoin use by itself will help with leftover scarring, but another exfoliating option is glycolic acid. Vitamin C serums/products are also good for lightening dark spots or dark scars- Skinceuticals C E Ferulic serum is pretty well liked and also contains the antioxidant vitamin E, which can improve the appearance of scars after the initial wound has healed as well as protect skin’s outer layer. There is also micro needling, which can either be done at a dermatologist’s office or at home with at home devices, but that’s something I’ve never done so I can’t exactly personally recommend it.,Wed Mar 14 12:42:04 2018
You look amazing! What type of moisturizer?,Tue Mar 13 22:20:19 2018
I think the clindamycin really helps because if there’s any hint of infection it clears it right up. I actually use it on my ingrown hairs too and on my arms. My arms and back of my legs have keratosis pilaris so it helps with the redness of all of that crap. 😬,Tue Mar 13 23:05:45 2018
I love this. Really gives me hope for the future of my skin and self confidence!! So happy for you!! ,Wed Mar 14 04:32:57 2018
amazing! looking fab!,Wed Mar 14 07:27:00 2018
I thought my acne was bad. But those seems like excellent results 
Acne scars will heal over time. Although i have heard exfoilating helps clear them faster ,Tue Mar 13 22:49:33 2018
i have found that massaging Bio Oil on my face before bed helps reduce my acne marks/scars ,Tue Mar 13 23:12:01 2018

WOWOWOWOWOWOWOW what scars?  you look like you haven't had a breakout since high school!,Wed Mar 14 01:05:57 2018
Whoah!!! And as for scars I don't see any really lol, but I can recommend Jamaican black castor oil. I was super sceptical about it but my sister bought some and in just like a week my scars were already alot less red and noticable. And skin feels smoother and softer. Just apply overnight and if your at home doing nothing.
And again, stunning transformation, you sure give motivation for many people!
,Wed Mar 14 02:46:28 2018
This is awesome and you look amazing! Did you have any initial breakouts? Also how long did it take for you to see noticeable results with tretinoin? ,Wed Mar 14 03:29:01 2018
Oh my gosh! You go girrrrrl! Incredible results. I’m 6 weeks into Retin A and purging like crazy. I want to cry. Are you using birth control pills or Spironolactone? Wanting to know if it’s only the Tretinoin that has cleared your skin?!?!,Wed Mar 14 08:49:30 2018
Gosh what a difference. And acne scars? What acne scars. Freckles aren't acne scars ,Wed Mar 14 18:00:38 2018
u look really sad in the before...  like I didn't even see the acne, I just saw your eyes. it breaks my heart. I'm happy things are better for you ( :,Sun Mar 18 22:53:40 2018
 Was tretinoin used every night then moisturizer for a year straight? what was your routine exactly? did it irritate at first then get better with time? what percentage of strength was it 0.05? 

how long to see results, let us know!  ,Tue Mar 20 22:00:50 2018
for scars use organic virgin olive oil or organic virgin grapeseed oil ( olive oil is better but try and see what works) massage into skin very well every night (pea size amount)before bed where the scars are as night serum! save lotions and creams for the morning, & use oil at night, it will take a couple weeks to see results but worth it! ,Tue Mar 20 22:22:16 2018
WHAT THE WOAH! 

Congrats on tret working for you! It did little to nothing for me.,Wed Mar 21 17:34:36 2018
i feel like the products you’re using are too harsh and are compromising your skin’s protective barrier. are you moisturizing? time to simplify and to ditch the wipes.

am routine:
gentle cleanser like cerave hydrating
good moisturizer
spf (elta md clear is the best for acne!)

spf is so important as it prevents the scarring/discoloration from getting worse among many other reasons :)

pm routine:
remove MU with micellar or oil cleanse
gentle cleanser
good moisturizer
retinoid (moisturizer before acts as a buffer for irritation)

as things progress or plateau then i’d suggest adding in more but not by means of scrubs or fragrance, two enemies of acne!,Wed Mar 14 22:48:30 2018
Chemical peels are wonderful especially for what you're suffering from. I use Exuviance AP 25 peels they're professional grade that you can do at home. They have helped by skin so much, they treat wrinkles, hyperpigmentation, scarring, and general texture of your skin. Before you spend a a lot more money on lasers I would try it out. ,Thu Mar 15 02:26:23 2018
I have been told that it takes multiple laser treatments to see full effects. Like 4-5. Idk how many you had within a period of 2-3 months but if it was only 1 that's probably why there wasn't much change,Wed Mar 14 23:05:11 2018
you should clear up the acne first before getting laser (I thought that was a requirement?). also it should take 4-5 sessions like said above to see a difference. sometimes you need a mix of treatments as well for maximum results. ,Wed Mar 14 23:44:51 2018
I've had acne since I was 10, so for about 18 years now. My skin looks to be similar to yours, but instead of forehead scarring, much of my pimples/cysts/scarring is concentrated on my jawline and neck. I also have EXTREMELY oily skin (more oily than anyone I've met or seen), have tried plenty of prescribed and OTC stuff, etc just to give you some background. 

I've changed my routine a little lately and have seen some improvement! 

AM- 

- pink Garnier Micellar Water: super gentle; non-irritating; doesn't dry out my skin; leaves my skin feeling clean; my favorite new product to have added!

- Neutrogena oil-free moisturizer spf 35: doesn't break me out, but not my favorite because it doesn't sink in well; used to use their daily moisturizer spf 50, but found it way too greasy, didn't sink it, and often pilled

- If I'm putting on foundation that day, I'll make sure to use these well before applying makeup


PM- 

- Stridex pads (red box): sometimes used as soon as I get home from school to cleanse/remove some oil from my face/neck/chest

- Neutrogena acne wash (orange colored): lathered with either my hands, a soft rubber facial scrubber, or a gentle exfoliating sponge; still on the lookout for something better though

- CeraVe PM moisturizer: was afraid the new formula would break me out, but I haven't seen any adverse reactions in the last month 


Occasionally PM- 

- Cosrx hydrocolloid patches: keep yourself from picking and use these! They're good for any size pimple or cyst and have definitely reduced inflammation time for me

- Target brand benzoyl peroxide: used 3-4 times per week if my skin isn't feeling sensitive

- Prescribed Tretinoin 0.1%: used maybe once a week; can be extremely drying, so moisturizers and hydration is necessary

- Squalane oil: sometimes I'll mix a couple of drops of this with my moisturizer; no frangrance; doesn't seem to clog pores; makes my skin feel softer

- Collagen face mask (from Daiso): really helps my skin feel refreshed and hydrated; seems to help with redness


I am definitely a beginner when it comes to knowledge about skincare, but one thing I know for sure is WATER makes a huge difference in my skin. Stay hydrated!!! Even a humidifier might work for you as well. (I loathe outdoor humidity, but when I travel to humid areas, my skin looks and feels great!)

I'm not sure if any of this will be helpful or beneficial for you, but I hope, at the very least, you know someone out there is struggling with the same stuff! 

PS: If anyone has any suggestions for me, I'd greatly appreciate it as well! Thanks!! ☺️

That after shave balm has hella fragrance. My skin hates fragrance and breaks out from it. Might want to switch to just a regular fragrance free moisturizer instead. I use moisturizer after I wash my face every time. A well-known option is Cerave PM in the pump. You can get it at the drugstore. ,Wed Mar 14 18:17:05 2018
Do you exfoliate? ,Wed Mar 14 23:20:52 2018
You should be exfoliating at least two To three times a week, using a Glycolic cleanser. I use Murads AHA/BHA cleanser. You need to exfoliate all the dead skin cells off and treat the skin underneath. L'Oréal also has a Glycolic acid cleanser you can get at the drug store ,Wed Mar 14 23:26:47 2018
?,Sat Mar 17 08:47:28 2018
If you want to have your skin treated by a professional, see an esthetician. Estheticians are skincare specialists. Cosmetologists are technically licensed estheticians, except they are only required to learn about a 3rd of what actual estheticians are. So she might have a general knowledge of skincare but she is likely better sticking with hair care. ,Wed Mar 14 22:49:42 2018

Slight improvement? I think it’s a drastic improvement! Congrats :) ,Tue Mar 13 13:51:33 2018
Hello r/acne, posted on here about a year ago detailing a 5 month improvement by means of only erythromycin. Since then, the antibiotic lost it's effectiveness causing me to relapse at times, the left picture being the worst. 

I knew prolonged antibiotic use wouldn't be good for me in the long term and eventually stop working, so since then I've committed to an actual skin care routine while also monitoring my diet.

For the about the past 3-4 weeks, I've been going with a basic 3 step routine day and night consisting of:
 
1). Noxzema Original Deep Cleansing Cream
2). Clean and Clear Persa Gel 10% Benzoyl Peroxide
3). Cetaphil Daily Facial Moisturizer

Alongside reduced intake/complete omitting of dairy, excess sugars and chocolate, I've noticed a gradual reduction with my current acne, with less appearing in my typical trouble spots.

The flash probably makes it seem better than it actually is, but I tried replicating the current picture to the before picture as best I can. My skin isn't perfect, but it's a sure way better than it was at its worst. Hopefully this helps you guys out there!,Tue Mar 13 12:13:03 2018

Have you tried cerave? They have a thick night cream that I like. ,Tue Mar 13 23:10:52 2018
Have you tried any hydrating face masks that you can leave on overnight? I love the thirst quencher mask from complex beauty. I apply a generous amount and leave it on overnight and wake up to more hydrated skin. After a few days of doing that in a row, my skin was flake free. I also have the glossier moon mask, and like it, but overnight it left my skin feeling sticky and kinda gross. The Glow Recipe watermelon sleeping mask is also really nice, but it has ahas and enzymes so I think it might not be the best because you mentioned your skin was sore after scrubbing and might need a break from exfoliating, physically and chemically. I *think* your skin barrier might have been compromised from too many exfoliating products so I would also try the dr. jart cicapair cream to help soothe and repair the barrier. ,Wed Mar 14 15:00:31 2018
Girl, if you’ve been doing bunches and bunches of routines that haven’t been working it’s very likely you have dehydrated skin (which will get oily and acne prone *because* it’s so dehydrated, but it isn’t true oily skin). Specially with the redness around your nose, that’s what it looks like to me. Check the blog “maid from scratch”. I’ve been following her routine for a couple of weeks and it’s been really good for me.
All the peeling you’re doing is probably just further drying, damaging and irritating your skin.,Tue Mar 13 20:51:59 2018
what's ur current skincare routine ,Tue Mar 13 18:11:19 2018
I had similar acne 2-3 years ago. I still having scaring left but what helped me tremendously was to simply wash my face without any products. My breakouts slowed down and lessened. It didn't go away completely though. 



Also, I used to eat tons of sugar. (Cookies,Cake,Chocolate,etc)

 Giving sugar up and those harsh face washes helped my acne a lot. I learned that my face was sensitive and easy to over dry (dehydrated) and that caused my face to produce EXCESS oil causing more acne.,Wed Mar 14 01:11:48 2018

Haven't tried these for acne by myself, but you just need to moisture more if your skin feels like burning. I don't know do you have skincare routine, but try layering (alcohol free) toner, add oil and find good, gentle yet heavy night cream. ,Wed Mar 14 11:35:18 2018

Do you have healthy diet otherwise and do you have skincare routine to treat your skin?

Personally I've noticed that green tea helps a lot for me but the results are slow. Matcha and rooibos is good for acne, as well as peppermint tea.

I'm also trying to eat almonds for vitamin E. Keeps skin soft and healthy.,Tue Mar 13 17:13:37 2018
You might benefit from a routine that treats dehydrated skin instead. This is what I do:

Every morning: freshen my face with rose water, then moisturize with cold cream

Once a week: do a probiotic face mask and a hydrating face mask (usually one on Wednesday and one on Sunday)

Stopped showering every day, and when I do, I no longer use hot water. Just cold or lukewarm. And water almost *never* touches my face. Also started drinking more water everyday and took out the foods that were offending me from my diet.,Wed Mar 14 07:53:07 2018

If you look close enough, most people do have some form of acne. Some cover it up, others don’t, so that’s an option. Acne is only a problem if you make it out to be, most people won’t even notice it/think twice about it. ,Tue Mar 13 09:05:14 2018
I know it's easy enough for other people to say but it's true: no one cares about acne, and the only people who point it out are insecure about something they have. You'll grow out of it; they'll never grow out of being a prick. Just play the waiting game, see a derma, and most importantly, stay happy. You deserve it xx,Tue Mar 13 09:10:12 2018
No one cares about acne my guy (or girl?). Really it all depends on how much you let it define you, do you see yourself as nothing more than a face filled with acne? Or a person with other qualities who other people should see? Everyone suffers from breakouts, it all falls down if you let it physically and emotionally cripple you. ,Tue Mar 13 13:53:06 2018
I usually just look around and realise a good percentage of people also have some form of it.,Tue Mar 13 16:18:10 2018
Personally i dont stay confident and just keep my head down,Tue Mar 13 11:19:07 2018
From what I've experienced, people don't look at you long enough to even notice your acne.. but if we're talking friends, well they probably don't care. I had 2 amazing friends back in HS who had probably the worse acne in school and no-one ever commented nor cared. (They were popular as well haha),Wed Mar 14 01:17:38 2018
It's not a cure. It may temporarily relieve redness or inflammation.,Tue Mar 13 11:18:15 2018
Just be very careful because taking it for long periods or at high doses can cause permanent kidney damage. Definitely let your doctor know that you have been taking it, how much and for how long etc. ,Tue Mar 13 20:16:01 2018

Dont exfoliate ur skin daily, it may irritate ur acne too much. I'd add more moisture and gentler cleanser.
For scarring  vitamin c and snail mucin is good. Also sunscreen! ,Tue Mar 13 11:49:54 2018
Someone on skincareaddicts sub mentioned ordinary’s nittroxine or some funky chem name. It’s only 6$, and is great with redness and scarring. It’s currently out of stock at Sephora, but I intend to get my hands on it when it becomes available again :),Tue Mar 13 11:57:28 2018

Oh listen to your derm. It seems to be a solid routine,Tue Mar 13 10:48:40 2018
Hyper-pigmentation sucks!! I’ve reduced mine SO MUCH in 1 month.

I use Vitamin E oil to fade my hyperpigmentation. I should’ve taken pictures to show how much my super red scars faded.

I recommend Jason Vitamin E oil (the more thiccc, the better! must have 3 c’s!) at 32000IU. Make sure it’s PURE oil and not laced with other ingredients, as you might be sensitive to other ingredients and breakout. 

Application Tips:
1) You need to apply it religiously and consecutively if you want scars to fade FAST.
2) Apply it at night.
3) Rub the oil into the scar spots. RUB. Now don’t tear into your skin, but you want a good rub.
4) Don’t apply the oil into active pimples. 
5) Cover your pillow with a towel


My usage: I used the oil for nearly over a week straight each night, and it faded my back and face hyperpigmentation dramatically. 

It also makes your skin glow, which is an awesome plus. ,Tue Mar 13 08:14:45 2018
I don't see what's "cash grabbing" about this. Your derm isn't making money off elta sunscreen. It looks like a good, simple routine that will do the job while being gentle.
Before I even had a routine, antibiotics cleared me up completely after my skin went a little nuts changing birth control. Took it for a few months and now I've not needed to since. Retinol is great for preventing acne, and it's also good for clearing scarring. Salicylic acid is my holy grail even now I only get the occasional spot. TO salicylic acid is the only thing that remotely touches cysts, and a facewash is a good preventative. I haven't tried lytera, but the reviews all raved about it fading scarring. ,Sat Mar 17 11:47:33 2018
I used a product with 1.5% Salicylic Acid for a few months and noticed a decrease in red hyperpigmintation spots. I don't have experience with the exact product you were prescribed, but it seems to me like you might as well give it a go. ,Tue Mar 13 13:20:43 2018
Additionally : lytera was suggested. Does anyone know anything about this?,Tue Mar 13 23:15:04 2018
I’ve been dealing with the same issue. Sounds like closed comedones. I have gotten rid of about 90 percent of mine but it has taken three months so far and I still have a ways to go.  I’m not a dermatologist but my best advice would be to get a super gentle cleanser. One that doesn’t make your face feel tight after you use it. Definitely stay away from the physical exfoliating scrubs like st Ives. A bha toner is what helped me the most but it takes time. Classic acne treatments don’t seem to work well on closed comedones because they aren’t inflammatory. Maybe start with a bha exfoliator every couple of days. When your skin gets used to that you could try alternating with an aha exfoliant like glycol is acid. Don’t forget your moisturizer. I also seem to develop fewer comedones when I use a light mineral makeup vs a liquid foundation. Hope this helps. Good luck. ,Tue Mar 13 03:04:39 2018
Used this exact cleanser in high school. Every Neutrogena product I have ever used (cleansers, SPF, even spot trestments) caused some kind of redness, dryness/flaking, breakouts, irritation... I swear my skin just hates Neutrogena. Never tried the other brand.,Tue Mar 13 20:19:43 2018

It has Glycolic acid and Latic acid, But the three different charcoals are what Amazing, it pulls everything go then surface then slowing the  acids into the pores to really do deep clean ,Wed Mar 14 21:06:40 2018
Latic and Glycolic ,Wed Mar 14 21:07:42 2018
Anything with a head (which is what I assume you mean since you said “open”) would actually be referred to as a pustule. Papules are inflamed, under the skin pimples that rarely form a head. As for your skin concern, I would suggest adding an active if you don’t use one already. Actives don’t really work for me but a lot of people seem to have good results. Glycolic acid, azealic acid, salicylic, etc..,Mon Mar 12 23:19:41 2018
I'm curious - - what is your skin type and what areas of you face that you seem to get the most acne? I also get acne around the same times and it comes up around my jaw line the most. ,Mon Mar 12 20:55:31 2018
use a moisturizer and a sunscreen in the morning!! also maybe try a more gentle cleanser because the actives in the cleanser may be irritating your skin. Maybe try a gentle routine for a while? Try a cleanser like cerave foaming cleanser, then follow up with the aveeno moisturizer that you already have. if you want to slowly start adding it actives, try stridex in the red box/cylinder whatever,Wed Mar 14 00:44:20 2018
I'd go see a derm. Cystic acne is hard to treat at home too. Also, do you cleanse your skin properly? 
Edit: its maybe not cystic, sorry! Try aha/bha and hydrocolloid patches ,Tue Mar 13 06:11:54 2018
Hemp Milk. Hemp milk is rich is Omega-3 and Omega-6. Studies have shown that supplementation with Omega-3 can reduce acne severity (over a ten week period (nothing is quick with skin) participants found they had reduced inflammatory acne by 40 to 50% and non-inflammatory acne by about 20% after supplementing with 1000mg EPA and DHA).  Hemp milk contains 0.9g Omega 3 and 2.9g Omega 6 per 250ml which means you would have to drink a lot of Hemp milk to have similar response to the clinical but.... it is a good choice alternative to dairy. Dairy milk has been shown clinically to increase the hormones that lead to a rise in sebum production and skin cell growth; both of which are a root cause of acne. Hope this helps.,Tue Mar 13 05:52:35 2018
Does or doesn't? There's a lot good alternatives, maybe r/vegan may help more ,Tue Mar 13 06:12:55 2018

I had acne across my jawline too, and also acne on my chest and back. Have you tried doxycycline antibiotics? Literally the only thing that helped me.

Not sure about that brand, but I use the body shops tea tree oil and I love it. Was my first step into skincare and it really helped my skin get more clear. Not helpfully for cystic but great for having less breakouts,Mon Mar 12 13:45:57 2018
Always dilute it in another oil or something else it is soluble in! I use about two drops mixed in with a teaspoon of jojoba oil or almond oil and use that as a spot treatment. It works for me because the tea tree is antibacterial and dries out the acne and the jojoba or almond oil then moisturizes to heal and protect.,Mon Mar 12 14:58:00 2018
I use it as well. Helps as an antibacterial and drying agent. I use about a 5 to 1 ratio dilute of tea tree oil in witch hazel and shake it up then use it as a toner on my face after washing but before moisturizing. For treating local acne it’s completely normal to put some on a cotton round and just gently dab on the spot. Make sure that if it burns or stings for longer than a couple of minutes you dilute it in some water or witch hazel to avoid irritating your skin!,Mon Mar 12 14:01:18 2018
I use it morning and night. With clean hands, i pour a dot out onto my finger (i used to use a q tip but this is so much easier), then spot treat each individual pimple, let it dry, then add a dot of aloe Vera gel on top of every spot individually. 
Clears my cystic acne better than retin-a or antibiotics.,Mon Mar 12 14:14:55 2018
I’ve used it with ‘meh’ results. Didn’t really see an effect on my acne. Be careful using it though! It’s poisonous if ingested, even in tiny amounts. So keep it away from your mouth, obvi. ,Mon Mar 12 14:34:31 2018
I don't dilute it. I have been using various brands for years. It works amazing on acne and insect bites. ,Mon Mar 12 17:25:22 2018
Thank you so much for all your tips! I realized I didn’t knew that much about it ,Mon Mar 12 14:51:21 2018

Be prepared for your skin to fluctuate a lot. I have acne as well, my skin cleared up a bit while pregnant and I had that "glow", but afterwards it came back in force. However, some women get worse acne during pregnancy. So it really just depends on you since everyone is different. Your best bet is to find a good routine that works for you and stick with it throughout. ,Mon Mar 12 12:00:15 2018
My dermatologist told me there are only 3-4 medications you can use during pregnancy. Clyndamycin lotion being one of them (that’s what I used). I would get off all supplements and acne meds and eat clean for a couple months before you plan to get pregnant. Only take a prenatal vitamin. My skin broke out for a few months and I would go to a lady for light peels, dermaplanning, and facials. But by around month 5 or so, my skin never broke out at all and stayed clear until like 4 months after baby came. Then all the sudden booooom cystic acne came back. Now I am back on Epiduo. Best of luck to you!!!!   ,Mon Mar 12 12:52:45 2018
i have been drinking tons and tons of water since i stopped the pill and i've been seeing a difference in my skin! i know it sounds obvious but it works. i've heard that hormonal cysts pop up when skin is dehydrated so hydrating your skin from the inside is a great place to start. drinking lots of water helps to regulate hormones too so it's a win win! i try to drink 64 oz + a day. getting those big water bottles with the measurements on the side is a good way to track your water intake ,Sat Mar 24 13:16:54 2018

Thanks for sharing - I had the exact same experience cutting out dairy.

Went on Accutane for a year, which worked temporarily, before deciding I would try treat the problem at the source - what I was putting into my body. Dermatologists fail to ask these questions and jump to medication.

I don't even crave dairy products anymore because all I can see/think about when I look at them is breakouts. We don't need dairy to be healthy, quite the opposite. I eat a lot of broccoli for calcium. ,Mon Mar 12 02:14:15 2018
I HAD THE SAME RESULTS. ITS DAIR NOT JUST MILK. FUCK IGF 1. ,Mon Mar 12 11:19:21 2018
I had the same experience as well. I also ended up finding out even butter gives me acne. Not completely break out, but it doesn’t look as good as if I cut it out 100%. Ghee seems to be fine but I also try not to have it all the time,Mon Mar 12 09:10:03 2018
Thanks for sharing your experience! I'm curious, did you cut out just milk or all forms of dairy (cheese, yogurt, etc)?,Mon Mar 12 10:06:02 2018
Are soya based products better? I’m just wondering because I love yoghurt and cheese. ,Mon Mar 12 14:06:20 2018

ive wanted to cut out dairy, its hard, but i think i will try,Mon Mar 12 15:02:45 2018
I have been dairy-free for a week now but I can’t say I’ve seen improvements. I know it’s only been a week but I’m so discouraged. :(
Did you see an immediate effect after quitting? ,Mon Mar 12 21:03:08 2018
I'm so happy you had a good experience, my GP was also amazing for my acne and eventually got me put on Accutane. ,Mon Mar 12 11:27:44 2018
My first GP was absolutely dreadful, wouldn’t listen to a word I said. Eventually I moved to another surgery and my GP there is amazing. Recommended me to a dermatologist for accutane at my first appointment (even though my acne at this point was fairly mild, but I spoke about how much it affected me mentally and it really felt like he actually cared what I had to say about my own skin!). So happy I didn’t let the first negative experience keep me from going to a doctor - and extremely happy the appointments are free and prescription prices are so decent!,Mon Mar 12 19:01:10 2018
F/23... Glad you had a good experience! I’ve had mild acne since I was 11 and never realised how unseriously I was taken by my GP until I switched practices very recently! This new GP saw how I had been on every acne medication available on the NHS (bar roaccutane) and had even been fobbed off with some twice over the years without realising! 

I only became aware of Roaccutane after joining Reddit. The GP took one look at how upset I was that my ‘mild’ acne was so stubborn, she referred me for it.

But surprise -- after waiting 8 weeks for the referral letter I rung up today and they haven’t even received my details 😂 

GPs and I don’t get along apparently!,Mon Mar 12 16:08:10 2018
That’s a really bad idea.  ,Mon Mar 12 13:39:44 2018
Yeah you shouldn’t do that. Go see a physician. ,Mon Mar 12 15:33:49 2018
I just started drinking matcha tea two days ago so I'm curious about this.,Mon Mar 12 06:26:22 2018
What kind of acne did you have before? Mild or moderate? I'm not saying matcha tea has no health benefits but how do you know it wasn't the prescription cream working its magic after a while? ,Mon Mar 12 10:54:13 2018
Anyone else have experience with Matcha Tea? I'd love to I hear more opinions,Mon Mar 12 13:58:24 2018
I Want to be able to drink matcha so bad but I am super sensitive to caffeine. Caffeine in sensitive individuals can lead to cortisol levels going up which could translate to more acne. I actually drank a bunch the other day and it made me throw up. If anyone does consider matcha make sure you’re consuming a proper amount - it’s super strong! ,Mon Mar 12 21:51:34 2018
hang in there!!!! i had gone to a dermatologist after i had struggled with mild acne that had turned severe after my town was hit by hurricane harvey. no cleanwater for a month + the stress RUINED my skin. but.....he made my skin even more terrible. i mean, cystic, oozing, and rashes all over. it was awful. i decided to go to a different dermatologist out of town, who prescribed me minocyline & tretinoin. within two weeks, my skin was A W F U L. it had worsened! i gave it another few months & my skin cleared right on up. give it time & do not pick!!!!! i know its hard but dont!!!!! remember to tone (i use the mario whatever rose water, any rose water would work), and moisturize! i use aveeno but its just what ive been using until i find something im set on. if youre on tretinoin, exfoliating is your new bff. i also use a skin bleach/lightening cream called nadinola for leftover scars, theyll be gone within a week. if youre using tretinoin with mino & it isnt working, ask if you could bump it up! when i used .025% i didnt get results, but when i went up to .050% it worked immediately. like i said, hang in there! it gets worse before it gets better. ,Mon Mar 12 05:04:02 2018
You’re probably having an initial breakout, especially if you started using all those products everyday all at once. Generally it’s a good idea to ease into a big change in your routine (for example, rather than starting out using epiduo every day, using it every other day until your skin gets used to it). Your skin is probably irritated by all these new products, which could be contributing to your initial breakout (IB). ,Mon Mar 12 15:01:26 2018
i don’t see anything.. bad pic? ,Mon Mar 12 12:50:13 2018
I agree.... diet plays a HUGE role (especially when we're wired to break out)! But gdamn, pizza is amazing--and pizza without cheese just isn't pizza.

A nice substitute for cow's milk is cashew milk -- it's pretty tasty (even unsweetened)

Blame it on being a teenager, especially being male, since your test levels are gonna be out of whack ,Sun Mar 11 19:08:06 2018
teenage acne is due to hormones, that’s not something you can prevent unless you go in birth control or something ,Sun Mar 11 20:20:54 2018
No chance,Sun Mar 11 19:59:19 2018
No way,Sun Mar 11 20:45:38 2018
One pimple does not mean your whole routine isn't working lol... Most acne is influenced by hormones, and further aggravated by genetic predisposition to things like oil production or inflammation. There's no perfect routine that will magically cure 100% of acne. Especially at your age. 

Stick with the routine, keep your skin healthy, and treat the occasional pimple with a spot treatment when they occur. ,Tue Mar 13 21:22:12 2018
diet is a major factor in acne.  no amount of skincare will fix a bad diet,Sun Mar 11 23:39:17 2018
I just started a new birth control in January for my hormonal acne called Gianvi (has the same hormones as Yaz), I don’t have any experience with ortho tri cyclen, but I’m really glad I started this new birth control. I’ve been taking birth control since 2015 and have tried three different kinds, this was the first one that worked for clearing up my face. As long as you take it around the same time every day, you shouldn’t get irregular periods or spotting. I encourage you to give it a couple months, you can always stop taking it if you don’t like it or don’t get the results you want. Good luck :),Sun Mar 11 14:03:52 2018
Each person reacts differently when taking any medication so it depends on how your body will react to it. If the birth control doesn’t work out for you then switch to a different one. I’m taking Yaz right now and it really made my skin clear. I do still break out but it wasn’t as terrible as before. Just give the pill a few months for it to adjust your body. ,Sun Mar 11 14:48:13 2018
bc pills cleared up my acne but once i stopped taking it due to the side effects, my acne came back 10 times worse. it got so bad that i am now on accutane. unless you plan on taking bc pills forever, i don’t think it should be used to treat acne, because once you stop taking it it’s just gonna come back. ,Sun Mar 11 16:51:52 2018
Apparently there are a decent number of women who get unwanted side effects from hormonal birth control. It’s really just depends on each individual person. For example, I’ve been on a handful of different hormonal birth controls over the years just for birth control reasons and I’ve not had a single negative side effect from any of them. That’s just me, but your experience will be your own. You can always discontinue (with your prescribing doc’s permission) the birth control if you experience bad side effects- there are multiple basic hormonal formulations, so you can try a different one at that point. On the other hand, while birth control didn’t cure my acne, it does definitely help keep it mild and under control.,Sun Mar 11 14:44:27 2018
Every woman has different side effects so you shouldn’t base your thoughts on someone who may have never had a side effect. 

I was on for a long time for my acne and it helped me tremendously. I got my period every time I was supposed to. Never had any spotting (only when I came off I got my period twice in one month)

I had a friend who became extremely depressed on birth control so she didn’t last long. 

You should try it out. I am going back on once I give birth in September. ,Sun Mar 11 15:24:06 2018
I was very very nervous about getting on birth control but I’m so happy I did! The reason I got on it was because of my acne and my periods were very heavy and irregular. It’s cleared up a lot of my acne which is great. Also going back to ur comment about spotting and ur period getting messed up. My doctor told me (and she was also right) I only had random spotting the first 2 months of starting my period and it wasn’t that bad, also ur periods r not random they are planned because of the birth control :) good luck,Sun Mar 11 20:57:29 2018

I’m also very curious about this. I have a (non-reproductive-related) condition that I need to take medicine for permanently, and the medication interacts negatively with hormonal birth control. It’s not harmful to me, just makes birth control less effective, so I would imagine it wouldn’t help my acne much. I have an appointment with my doctor next week and I plan to bring it up, but I’m starting to feel very hopeless, because my acne is very clearly related to my hormones (there’s a noticeable difference at different points in my cycle).,Mon Mar 12 15:42:02 2018
Get on birth control because it will help, but pay attention to your body and communicate with your doctor if you feel like something is wrong. I can’t stress enough how important both of these things are. 

There are a lot of different types of birth control pills out there, at a lot of different hormone mixes and levels. The first one you try might not be the right one for you. One that makes your face completely clear might make you have horrible mood swings. That doesn’t mean you need to give up or live with it, talk to your doctor and try something else!! And if you feel like something isn’t right (ie: you find yourself crying more than usual or are easily irritated) then tell them. If they don’t listen, find a new doctor. They should take your concerns seriously and there should be mutual respect. 

Finding the right birth control might take time, but is worth the effort because it has so many benefits (regular periods/less mood swings/improves acne/no babies). Good luck!!

Experience: I’m almost 30 and have been on bc since I was 16. Tried at least 4 different pills, now have an IUD,Mon Mar 12 19:12:09 2018
It’s completely normal to feel how you’re feeling. I was in the same exact position. I agree with everyone else that says it’s important to listen to your body and work with your doctor. I was put on ortho tri cyclen a year ago. I was iffy because I didn’t like the idea of being on medication. But I’m really glad I did!! Take my experience with a grain of salt, but I didn’t have any disturbances in my cycle. Remember, medical practitioners generally prescribe things because they feel that the benefits outweigh the risks. For the first week I took it, I did have pretty bad nausea for about an hour after I took it each day. I like it because it actually made my cycle more regular though and after that week or so I didn’t experience any side effects. My skin did clear up quite a bit :) But after a year, I still had some pimples. So I definitely won’t preach it as a cure-all, but it has been helpful for me. I’ve now re-evaluated my acne with a derm, and she put me on spironolactone which works with my birth control to stop hormonal acne. My skin is quite clear now! Best of luck! :) ,Sat Mar 17 13:25:06 2018
I tried about 7 different kinds of birth control for my skin from about age 14 to 23. I was off and on for years because for me,  THE SIDE EFFECTS SUCK.  I only found one that didn't give me crap side effects and of course they discontinued it.  One of them,  I put on like 15 pounds in a month. Being a health nut, I was NOT ok with that.  Another pill made my anxiety worse and gave me panic attacks.  I stopped taking bc for years and in a desperation, tried one more in my 20s just to see how my body would react. I was given lo ovral, which is a very low hormone pill and is supposed to have the least amount of side effects.  I was fine until about 15 days in and I woke up literally thinking I had the flu. I spent hours sitting by the toilet so nauseated. I was nauseous for days following and I couldn't take it anymore. I went off that one too. Everyone is different though.  My mom never had any bad side effects.  My body just doesn't take to bc,Sat Mar 24 00:28:06 2018
I started spiro without BC and it didn’t do much of anything for me because of my PCOS. I added BC recently and it has done a lot. Conversely, i was off BC for about a year and lost all libido and general interest in my relationship but since restarting, that has begun to change and i’m happier about that. I should note that from 16 until 27, i was on estrostep and trilegest fe but I requested yaz (well, generic obviously) because i felt the other wasn’t really helping my PCOS nor is it as effective when paired with spiro as ones often touted on this sub. Also worth noting, i’ve taken adderall for my ADD since ~2009 and *that* is the cause of all my fuzziness. I have learned to manage that as best as possible though it has gotten increasingly harder as i’ve got like 10 years of that crap impacting my memory and brain :( i have found that certain brain foods really help though, have you tried adding certain foods and removing others? If the spiro doesn’t help alone or you feel like you should try a BC again, it’s worth looking into and also developing certain methods that help you keep your mind sharp (new studying or learning approaches, different brain exercises, etc). It may sound fruity, but it *has* helped, even in my situation. 
Which BCs have you tried? Some really mess with moods :/,Sun Mar 11 15:20:18 2018
Moisturize, don't touch it, and wait. It's likely just blood under the surface of your skin but anything beyond your normal skincare routine is just going to make it worse or lead to scarring.

Go see a derm if you're able, they might be able to give you a shot or extract something.,Sun Mar 11 16:00:28 2018
I have had a few of these. The blackish blue color faded (to reddish normal pimple color) and the pimp went away. I wouldn’t worry at all.,Sun Mar 11 23:39:47 2018
I have noticed my skin is much clearer when having 1-2 bowel movements a day.
And if I don’t my skin will be terrible the next day with painful acne.
I definitely think there’s a connection ,Sun Mar 11 06:30:15 2018
Yes! This is so true. A great way to help this is taking probiotics. You can find them in your local vitamin store, or if your grocery has a vitamin aisle. Also, try to cut out some dairy in your diet. Maybe drink almond creamer with your coffee, lay off yogurt or cheese. Also zinc supplements are great with acne! But 100% look into getting some probiotics. I would suggest 8 million per capsule. It helps the good bacteria in your guts which will help benefit the bacterial on your skin :) ,Sun Mar 11 12:45:35 2018
I'm having this issue at the moment and it's really getting me down because I've had my acne pretty much under control for the past year. I always get a few spots on the last week of my pill and during the break week when I get my period, and I usually have some digestive issues during this time too. My digestion has been particularly bad this month, and that combined with my period has spots breaking out in places that I never get them like my cheeks and forehead. There's a lot of redness around the breakouts too and it doesn't seem to be fading, I think it's probably because I've got a lot of internal inflammation with my digestion. ,Sun Mar 11 07:16:08 2018
Yes I do, I think it's due to the inability to get rid of toxins from the body so they are expelled via the skin. I have poor digestion so naturally this fucks up my skin 😭,Sun Mar 11 04:57:16 2018
Hi , u can use benzoyl peroxide /clindamycin  gel to coat the acne with and then try manoeuvring around the active acne 🤔.. or u could do a pulse dose therapy of azithromycin  ( 500mg OD  three days a week only for 5 weeks  ) use BP nightly .. wait for the acne to subside and then Dermaroll ...  
Please seek ur physicians guidance before  any oral medication ..  

,Sun Mar 11 11:02:31 2018
Definitely avoid rolling on any active spots. It will spread the bacteria and potentially cause more acne or even damage and scar your current spots. Blackheads probably don't matter so much but for sure try to avoid CC's/whiteheads. Only roll over the scar you are trying to improve, and only about once every four to six weeks. You don't want to overdo it. It takes time for your collagen to regenerate after being damaged which is basically what dermarolling does. 

Always do it on a clean dry face and sterilize the roller as best you can with alcohol before and after every use. Also for cleaning personally I use a baby toothbrush and lightly brush it then soak with alcohol to remove any hair or skin particles that may get stuck. They're gentle enough to not break the needles.,Tue Mar 13 21:34:57 2018
Since a few months, I've been visiting a skin therapist almost weekly. I'm still in treatment, I hope I'll have clear skin in a while!
I've also been changing my pillowcase daily. I drink lots of water, I changed the products I use on my face, and I stopped wearing face makeup. Also, I changed my diet (not sure it it's related to my skin clearing up), I eat way more fruit than I used to, and I have way more fibre in my diet.,Sat Mar 10 07:22:29 2018
What exactly is a skin therapist?  Never heard of this ,Sat Mar 10 21:15:49 2018
Depends on the lotion. Most hand/body lotions are scented which can cause acne/irritation for some people. It’s best to find a moisturizer specifically for face to use. Moisturizing your face is super important imo. ,Sun Mar 11 04:36:22 2018
I use Gold Bond Ultimate Healing Skin Therapy 
Doesn’t really have much of a scent though. But i wanna get a moisturizer that has a spf ,Sun Mar 11 05:03:19 2018
I use shea butter it works well on moisturizing and it doesn't clog my pores.,Sun Mar 11 10:26:09 2018
Don't use body/hand lotions onbyour face. Find a moisturizer formulated specifically for use on the face.,Tue Mar 13 21:39:38 2018
Most of them are just scars. Best thing you can do is going to dermatologist,Sat Mar 10 16:59:37 2018
Looks like mostly scarring and some freckles. Doesn't look like cystic acne so it could be helped by something simple like cutting things out of your diet (dairy, sugar) or even just as simple as switching laundry detergents to something more natural and changing pillow cases often. Lots of sunscreen too! If you go to a dermatologist they are going to prescribe meds. Before I would do that, I would exhaust all other natural options first because I think you can help yourself, I don't think you'll need heavy meds or anything! Good luck! ,Sun Mar 11 00:53:34 2018
Scarring with some inflammation, a few tips I can give you, make sure you're using only non scented moisturizers, rub gently (no need to scrub your face it just makes it more red and irritated), changing your pillow cases, try cutting dairy out for a bit and see how that works for you :)

If all else fails and you consider the option for yourself then go ahead and see a dermatologist ,Sun Mar 11 03:46:14 2018
How long does it last? It could be a cold sore?,Sun Mar 11 00:35:46 2018
You might wanna see a professional for this one,Sun Mar 11 03:47:16 2018
I honestly think it's a cold sore. I get one on my face occasionally and I thought it was a pimple but nothing worked. I tried Abreva and it was gone in 2 days. 🤷‍♀️,Sun Mar 11 09:04:54 2018
Could also be a cyst—one of those cysts that need surgical removal.,Sat Mar 24 12:12:55 2018
Sorry I'm on my phone and it won't let me add text to the post but basically I've never had terrible, terrible acne/skin, only mild, but my skin has never been perfect. I've always gotten this nasty pimple in the same spot on my face though over and over again, and even though it will go away for maybe a week, it always reappears in the same spot. Sorry the picture isn't good, but is it cystic acne? There's never a head to them always just a large red pimple on my face that's so gross :( any suggestions on how to get rid of this for good? It really affects my confidence in day-to-day life and I don't like to wear makeup, but especially when it looks this bad, I feel like I'm required to. ,Sun Mar 11 00:28:31 2018
I recently talked to my derm about the same issue - I get acne on my back in the summer. She recommended using Nizoral Shampoo on my back while showering. I *have not* tried it yet, but it was recommended by a professional, so maybe it is worth a try for you. It is available at Walmart and other common places.,Sat Mar 10 15:44:33 2018
Hi! I had that issue as well. I got the First Aid Beauty skin rescue body bar and it changed my life. It is $5 and I promise you its worth it, which is crazy because it is kind of a high end company. I got a lot of my friends on it and it worked for them too. Just rub it on your loofa and keep it on your back and shoulders for a lil while. Make sure you arent allergic to any of the ingredients. Good luck!,Sat Mar 10 16:14:55 2018
I had back acne for 10 years and it’s cleared up almost completely after playing around with a few routines. When I shower I ALWAYS wash and condition my hair first making sure to completely rinse everything out and put my hair up before washing my body (shampoo/conditioner can clog your pores).  I use the body clear pink grapefruit as well,  it definitely works for me. I use a loofa and scrub my back in a circular motion to rid the dead skin and clean my pores. Rinse with lukewarm or cold water to close up your pores and make sure to rinse completely so no product is left on your skin. Pat your skin dry and wait a few minutes before moisturizing. I use cetaphil moisturizer for back and body. It’s extremely important to moisturize because dead skin cells can clog your pores and cause acne. If you have long hair don’t let it touch your back while it’s wet. Keep it up until you have a shirt on and put a towel over your shoulders so it doesn’t saturate your shirt. Also, don’t over do it with the acne products. Sometimes I’ll just use the cetaphil body cleanser to clean my skin. Over using acne wash can also cause breakouts lol basically everything can which sucks. Don’t go more than two days without showering! This cleared up my back acne (still have scars) in about a month. It takes time but have patience. This comment is longer than I wanted but I know how depressing body acne can be. Hopefully this helps! If not feel free to message me for any other advice! 

Edit: make sure you wash your back immediately after working out,Sat Mar 10 22:50:42 2018
Maybe try switching shampoos. Something in there might be causing you to break out. I just switched to a paraben and sulfate free shampoo and noticed improvement. ,Sun Mar 11 03:16:55 2018
I think you might have answered your own question; if a Derm prescribed your Accutane ask them about the spots as they may need to be extracted to avoid the scaring/pigmentation. Good luck ,Sun Mar 11 12:49:49 2018
[deleted],Tue Mar 13 21:52:23 2018
Going off of the type of cystic acne and placement on the face, I think accutane would work very well for you. It’s a tough medication to take but after 6 months of using it, many people don’t ever get acne again. My fiancé had acne like yours and accutane worked wonders for him. You wanna go to a dermatologist. ,Sat Mar 10 10:58:47 2018
What is your diet/routine like?,Sat Mar 10 12:38:31 2018
Maybe Accutane? I’ve also tried all so my derm finally said Accutane. ,Sat Mar 10 10:06:16 2018
Please ho on accutane,Sun Mar 11 09:51:41 2018
It would be easier to help you if you posted your current skincare routine and background info like treatments and products you have tried in the past that were ineffective. ,Tue Mar 13 21:56:34 2018
I’m glad you’ve decided not to remove the honest review. Others want to know what your actual experience was so they don’t end up having the same one.
This actually just happened to me but on eBay (and the bribe wasn’t money but sending me a new item to replace the faulty one I received). It was sketch because they wanted me to change my review to a good one BEFORE sending me the new product, which might not have worked either. I say just let the truth hang right out there because what are they really going to do about it (besides waste your money)?,Fri Mar  9 16:42:00 2018
well i think that you deserve your money back, so maybe you could post from an anonymous yelp account just warning ppl not to go,Fri Mar  9 15:21:10 2018
I’d take the money, we broke. ,Fri Mar  9 21:49:35 2018
This sounds so dodgy. You definitely deserve the refund and I wouldn’t remove the yelp review. Also is there not someone you can report him officially to? Especially if he is prescribing without a licence. I’m in the UK so don’t really know how it works where you are but he would be      disciplined here and probably stopped from practising.  ,Sat Mar 10 02:59:27 2018
Wtf you should report this dude to the authorities he should not be practicing without a license. What country are you in??,Tue Mar 13 21:58:43 2018
Well there are a few more things to try:

- Cutting our dairy 
- Benzoyl Peroxide Contact Therapy
- Epiduo
- Differin + antibiotic
- Epiduo + antibiotic
- Azelaic Acid
- Clindacymin + Differin
- Tazorac
- Retin A
- Isotretinoin

In order from mild treatment to nuclear haha,Sat Mar 10 06:00:54 2018
Currently using tretinoin 0.05%, and cetaphil gentle skin cleanser ,Sat Mar 10 04:37:03 2018
It looks like you have some hormonal acne. I would recommend the birth control pill. I take brand name yaz (generic won’t help as well as brand name for acne) and it has worked wonders on my chin acne. 
Also, try a silk pillow case and changing it every 2-3 days. ,Sat Mar 10 11:00:32 2018
I fuckin love your attitude and the fact that you’ve got yourself in a quality comfortable position in life. Imma save this post for if acne ever gets me down.

Anyway, laser treatments are the new big thing. They are very promising. They completely restore texture after a few sessions.

My suggestion? Vbeam laser (pulsed dye laser). Effective, safe, might be costly but I promise you won’t be disappointed. Good luck!



,Sat Mar 10 06:05:39 2018
Microneedling Radiofrequency :) works amazing for all types of acne scars . Talk  to your dermatologist . U need a minimum of three sessions once a month . If u have ice pick scars ask your dr about  a technique called TCA cross.. good luck 👍,Sat Mar 10 06:14:51 2018
Laser treatments is a thing, tho haven't tried them. Some also say dermarolling is good, you can do it at home but if you go to spa they can use longer needles. 
Idk how into skincare you are, but vitamin c, rice and snail mucin is good for scars. Bio-oil is nice too.,Sat Mar 10 07:10:29 2018
Congratulations!,Fri Mar  9 07:41:50 2018
What amazing progress! Keep it up and keep us posted!,Fri Mar  9 00:38:39 2018
Great! Thanks for posting your results and message of encouragement, because god knows us people in this particular sub can often use a dose of skintastic optimism,Fri Mar  9 17:05:15 2018
You have very nice routine! You're not over doing it at all, remember to patch test them slowly, so you can see do u get any bad reactions from he products. For example I've had rash from sunscreen and lots of CCs after using some specific products/brand. 
I see no reason why not to use oil together with the acne cream, but try it with oil or moisturizer to see which is better for your skin. ,Sat Mar 10 00:31:19 2018
You’ve got a good start with a routine! I highly recommend the acne(dot)org regimen! It’s basically what you are already doing plus a Benzoyl Peroxide gel. You’d do your Cetaphil cleanser, wait 5 minutes, apply BP gel, wait 5 minutes, and lastly apply your moisturizer. It’s a very simple and effective regimen! ,Fri Mar  9 17:39:46 2018
Which moisturizer are you using? I would probably start incorporating some “actives”. Have you tried azelaic Acid? It has been so helpful with my acne. Look up Melazepam on amazon! ,Fri Mar  9 19:17:35 2018
A couple quite commonly used (and easily found over the counter at the drugstore) treatments would be any benzoyl peroxide product (topical application, comes in different formulations, mild to moderate acne, kills acne bacteria, takes at least a month to show progress, only works while being consistently used, can dry skin out); salicylic acid (topical application, mild acne, comes in different formulations, unclogs pores/prevents pimples, mild acne, only works while being consistently used); retinol (topical application, comes in different formulations but Differin Gel is the only OTC retinol product approved for acne treatment, mild to moderate acne, chemical exfoliator to prevent pimples from forming, can get a prescription strength for more severe acne, MUST be diligent about using sunscreen always when using, can take a couple months before consistent progress is seen and acne may initially seem to worsen before getting better, can irritate skin, must be used consistently).

There are of course also a host of prescription acne treatments, especially for moderate to severe acne, but if you’d like to get good information on those I suggest visiting a dermatologist/doctor who can both suggest certain medications, prescribe them, and also monitor your progress. I would suggest first trying one of the over-the-counter treatments for a while... whichever one you discover your skin tolerates best. If it doesn’t do anything/enough after a month, try another kind of OTC acne treatment. If that one doesn’t do anything/enough, you may want to find a dermatologist in order to discuss prescriptions meds/in office procedures (because it’s not always about something you slather on your face).,Fri Mar  9 19:28:44 2018
Just adding my two cents but have you had your hormone levels checked? Even if it is considered “normal” each person has their own normal levels. I dug into this for my own skin and had success in tackling it from a hormone perspective. Been on spiralactone and progesterone and it has done wonders. ,Sat Mar 10 02:46:52 2018
Just a different sugggestion, you might wanna try adding more moisturizing agents into your routine, maybe something like jojoba oil or hemp seed oil. This would allow your skin you stay hydrated and repair itself ,Sat Mar 10 12:42:37 2018
Your acne looks like my acne did. I used Cetaphil products for a long time before I experimented and learned my skin was irritated by cetyl/cetearyl alcohols that their products are laden with. Could be a starting point to change those products if that is all you are using. ,Sat Mar 10 13:01:36 2018
I have been thinking of trying Differin Gel, Glossier Solution, Pixi Glow Tonic or something by The Ordinary to help clear this up. does anyone have recommendations? ,Sat Mar 10 18:51:54 2018
Please go on accutane now is the best time and put non comedogenic sunscreen when going out,Sun Mar 11 09:53:46 2018
Please use sunscreen ,Sun Mar 11 06:12:33 2018
And vitamin c and zinc can interact, I hope those aren’t both lotions or serums ,Sun Mar 11 06:13:35 2018
Also, there are some way better options then vitamin E for acne scarring ,Sun Mar 11 06:54:45 2018
[removed],Sun Mar 11 06:55:19 2018
Defending on your age and type of breakouts, I would say vitamin C would be better for fading minor scarring. The skincare addiction subreddit is amazing ... great product recommendations and advice ,Sun Mar 11 06:56:53 2018
You got this dude, do you use a moisturizer aswell?,Thu Mar  8 22:19:56 2018

Take a look at  those fuckin gains. Props 👯‍♂️,Mon Mar 19 15:09:41 2018
So no bread? I don't think I could do that :(,Thu Mar  8 21:06:39 2018
Nope, tried basically every “natural” solution and there is no easy, homemade, one or two product solution, BUT thankfully, there are lots of organic skin care brands out there that cater to people who don’t want a bunch of chemicals on their skin. 

Tea tree oil (diluted ALWAYS DILUTE ESSENTIAL OILS, I don’t care what the shifty pyramid scheme companies say!) helps for some but not most. 
Oil cleansing method works for a very very select few. 
Aloe helps with moisture and is a nice step to add to skincare routines but won’t do anything on its own.
Never use lemon juice or baking soda on your face, EVER. Strips your moisture barrier and damages your skin soooo bad.
Coconut oil on your face is an internet joke, people are telling you to use it to break you out and mess with you. It’s highly comedogenic and dries most people’s skin out because it’s a surfecant and doesn’t actually moisturize but keeps a film on your skin.,Fri Mar  9 20:10:35 2018
Daily turmeric supplements made a huge difference, it’s not a cure but it cleared me up significantly.,Fri Mar  9 22:24:50 2018

Darn. I meant to link some NIH studies but r/acne isn’t a fan. Anyways, check out gugulipid and zinc. ,Wed Mar 14 23:44:26 2018
Just thought you should know that homeopathy is fake. It doesn't work for anything. The idea behind it is you take a substance that causes something, like acne or insomnia and use it to cure that thing. But, there's a catch, you take the substance and dilute it with water so much that there is no longer a single molecule of the substance left. Homeopathy is just water or in some cases sugar pills. Don't waste your money.,Thu Mar 15 01:48:46 2018
Nervous it’ll spread bacteria around but kind of intrigued by the idea of cleaner pores than I’d have using my fingers! Or am I a sucker for buying this?

Also do you use regular cleanser on it, exfoliant, either?,Fri Mar  9 00:37:11 2018
Don’t use an exfoliating cleanser with it! I’ve seen amazing results with silicone scrubbies (so much so that I upgraded to the Foreo Luna Mini 2). I put on my treatment products right after and the exfoliation helps my products absorb so nicely ,Fri Mar  9 03:45:28 2018
I have the exact same one and was using it with a regular cleanser. It is nice for exfoliation once a week but doesn't give the deepest clean ever. For $8 or whatever it costs it's fine,Fri Mar  9 10:49:29 2018
You shouldn't stop taking your antibiotics before the prospect/ your doctor says because then you'll "create" resistants.

See, here's the thing: antibiotics kill bacteria, if you take one dose you'll kill the weaker ones, another dose you'll kill the ones that are slightly stronger, and so goes on. Meaning that your last doses are targeting the stronger bacteria. If you cut off antibiotics prematurely, you are leaving the *stronger* bacteria on your skin. And moreover, you've just cleaned the other bacteria that were competing with the stronger ones for space, and the stronger bacteria will spread potentially creating stronger ones.

These will make it more difficult the next time to get rid of your acne-causing bacteria.

&nbsp;

So regarding how much time you have to be on Cefalexin, you should just take it as much time as your doctor tells you to; they will set a timing regarding the severity of your acne. Anyhow, you shouldn't be on antibiotics more than three subsequent months because that could really affect your natural biota.,Sun Mar 11 07:42:07 2018
Time to go on Accutane! ,Fri Mar  9 10:45:26 2018

So I’ve been on them for 8 months. ,Sun Mar 11 14:53:45 2018

I had one of these. A dermatologist had to surgically remove it in the office (quick and not too painful). ,Sat Mar 24 12:14:40 2018
You may have something called keratosis pilaris. Look it up and compare. If you do have it, there isn’t really a cure since it’s genetic. But you can manage it. When you take a shower use an exfoliating cloth to scrub your arms, and use really good lotion right after. I would use gold bonds rough and bumpy.,Thu Mar  8 13:32:36 2018
I guess scrubbing is a bit of a strong word but you do want to exfoliate. But yes you don’t want to scrub your acne because it will break the skin and scar your face. But keratosis pilaris is caused by excess production of keratin and blocks the hair follicle causing the bumps and redness . You should look it up because though I have KP and manage it, I am by no means an expert. If you are unsure, go to your General practitioner or dermatologist. ,Thu Mar  8 13:48:40 2018
Lactic acid or Urea may help.,Thu Mar  8 15:36:25 2018

Eat less gluten ,Thu Mar  8 17:05:20 2018
I have to eat gluten free due to a disease and it does not help me with acne. Mine is hormonal and needs spironolactone,Thu Mar  8 10:54:26 2018
I'm on the leaky gut diet (basically an elimination diet including no dairy, grains/gluten, soy, sugar, legumes, night shades to name a few) my skin has been clearing up miraculously. It's only been a week and a half so I don't wanna get too excited yet. Since starting this my diet has been so much healthier at the same time. I'm only eating fish/meat and tons of veggies and a little fruit. I've been an acne sufferer for 13 years and have tried everything under the sun, so maybe diet is the real answer for me, I dunno!! You could have unknown food sensitivities that are triggering your acne also. I think it's worth a shot, nothing to lose,Thu Mar  8 14:23:02 2018
For me cutting out carbs worked. I was trying keto to lose weight and clear skin was a side effect. I eat moderate amount of dairy and it is not a problem for me. Get your vit D levels checked, if it is low your hormones will be imbalanced. Try getting more Omegas in your diet along with Vitamin supplements and see if it helps. ,Thu Mar  8 11:28:35 2018
Gluten free did nothing for my acne. Cutting dairy did. ,Thu Mar  8 12:21:45 2018
I’ve been gluten and dairy free for a couple months now and nothing’s changed for me :(,Thu Mar  8 12:22:39 2018
Nars concealer breaks me out, so I'm right there with ya.,Thu Mar  8 17:59:33 2018
My sheer glow breaks me out. I don't understand how so many people love the foundation, my face hates it. ,Thu Mar  8 18:20:52 2018
