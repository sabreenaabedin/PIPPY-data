Skin can be a little finicky as it adjusts to the changing seasons. Our solution? Picking products with the same precision Goldilocks did (without drumming up a fight with three bears, luckily) so everything is just right . Seaweed Cleansing Soap . Creamy, mineral-rich, and formulated with real (yes, real ) seaweed grains, this easy-rinsing face wash leaves skin feeling rejuvenated. It’s a double-duty face wash that exfoliates while cleansing your skin, which means you get a little glow-boosting action twice daily. Plus it smells like the sea—every bit fresh and beach-y like its ingredients. Seaweed Cleansing Lotion . Some skin types tend to get oilier once the weather warms up—but they’re still a little dehydrated or too winter-worn to start using the Cucumber Cleansing Lotion just yet. Enter the Seaweed Cleansing Lotion, a mild astringent that’s formulated with Witch Hazel to help cleanse skin of excess oil and impurities without overdrying skin. Bladderwrack (a mineral-rich seaweed) and Aloe Vera combine to soften and lightly hydrate—leaving skin refreshed and re-balanced. Botanical Exfoliating Scrub . Exfoliate away the dull, winter blues. Literally. Hyaluronic Eye Cream . Swap out your rich, winter eye cream for something a little more lightweight. Hyaluronic Acid and Safflower Seed Oil are the power players in this formulation that replenish and lock in moisture without feeling heavy on your skin. Honey Moisturizer . Though simple by nature—the name says it all—our Honey-infused moisturizer is truly a gorgeous formulation that softens, smooths, and boosts radiance in combination skin. Seaweed Night Cream . For extra nourishment in the evenings, reach for this oil-free night cream. A luxe, silky-smooth texture makes it a treat to apply every night. And come morning, you’ll wake up with softer, smoother, dewier-looking skin.

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Title":["ABOUT"],"url":"https://blog.mariobadescu.com/about/","Text":["Here at Mario Badescu we’re always finding ways to stay connected to our customers – some of whom we’ve shared 40-year-long relationships with. We believe in maintaining that connection; our mission remains the same since Mario Badescu himself founded his Manhattan skincare salon in 1967: To brighten up the world with our time-tested skin care products and treatments, in order to provide customers with the beautiful and healthy skin every human being is entitled to. Romanian-born Badescu started in his kitchen, formulating his signature products in his home. Eventually he opened a skincare salon on the bottom floor of his residential building, establishing a one-on-one relationship with clientele : intimate, and very much exclusive. And since its opening, Badescu has both grown and evolved as a brand, having amassed a loyal following privy to his line of simple, gentle, fresh-botanical-based ingredients and reliance on Old-World skincare techniques. We insist on holding true to Mario Badescu’s vision: simplicity is the key to healthy, clean, radiant skin. Confidence starts with beautiful skin : it’s our duty to bring that to you . We pride ourselves in still offering the same personal, customized skin care treatments that were Mario’s patent offerings. Everyone deserves good skin care . Thus, we have maintained Mario’s dedication to offering our skin care products at exceptional prices. We invest in the product itself; packaging and advertising is of irrelevance when it comes to giving you – our customers – the best we can deliver. We’ve relied only upon your word of mouth : so without you, Mario Badescu would be nowhere what it is today. And so, in this little roundabout, we’ve been brought back to where we began. As we’ve evolved and grown throughout the years simply from good word of mouth, you have, too. We want to stay connected, to share our little tips and secrets and most importantly, hear from you . How? Here."],"_cached_page_id":"53478578541a5c942a10a549e02b4f3441592e4a","_template":"4e29-4ca9-8be4"}
{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Nicole Darmanin"],"url":"https://blog.mariobadescu.com/best-cleanser-toner-skin-type/","Text":["Because the right cleanser and toner can make or break your daily skin care regimen. If your skin care regimen was a house, your cleansing and toning routine would be the foundation. These steps set the rest of your regimen up for success. Using a cleanser or toner that is too aggressive can leave your skin feeling tight and uncomfortable, which can lead to dry patches and flaking. Using ones that are too mild for your skin type may cause congestion, blackheads, and milia. The right duo will leave your skin feeling fresh and comfortable. Whether you are cleansing after a night’s sleep in the morning or washing away traces of a long day before bed, there are few things in life that feel quite as nice as a freshly washed face. Keep reading for our favorite cleanser/toner duos for every skin type. Oily/Acne-Prone Botanical Facial Gel – This Grapefruit-infused cleanser breaks down shine and impurities on even the oiliest skin types without being harsh. It is a great summertime face wash if your oil production rises when the thermometer does.

This formula contains complexion-boosting botanicals including Thyme Extract, which has been shown in studies to help banish blemishes.

Cleanser? Check. Toner. Check. Drying Lotion ? Check! And since you’ve done your research , you know not to shake the Drying Lotion (Still want to give it a shake? Don’t take our word for it. ) You skin is looking good and you feel like this: Then, when you least expect it, a blemish pops up! You know what to do. You reach for that bottle of zit-fighting magic, and before you can even register what is happening, you fumble. Your Drying Lotion slips, escapes from your hand, and your #catlike reflexes kick in (Luckily, you took those martial arts classes for that month in second grade! #thanksmomanddad) and you are able to catch the bottle before it crashes to the floor. Whew! But, ugh, not before your perfect bottle of layered pimple kryptonite is all mixed up. First you feel confusion, then despair sets in and now you are all: So here’s where one of our most frequently asked questions comes in. Lots of you would like to know, “If my Drying Lotion is shaken, is it ruined?” The A. to that Q. is, no. Not at all. Simply set the shaken bottle on a flat surface then distract yourself with some TV, or better yet, a good book, and hang in there until it settles. “But will it still work the same?” you ask. Yes, it will. “It won’t make it less effective?” No, sir or ma’am. It will not. Us? Oh, we’re just waiting for our Drying Lotion to settle. So there you have it! The most anxiety-provoking conundrum in the battle for clear skin has been solved for once and for all. It seems that when it comes to Drying Lotion (and life in general) an occasional shake-up is nothing to worry about!

This new facial spray has been a long time coming. Long, because our chemist is a perfectionist (a woman after our founder’s own heart), and because we wanted to find the perfect combination that satisfied your needs. For years, you’ve asked for a new facial mist. Some just wanted something to add your collection of rosewater facial sprays; others were a little more specific. You wanted invigorating. You wanted an antioxidant boost. A mist that was less rose-y, perhaps—one that ups the fresh without the floral. Check, check, check, and check . We’re thrilled to give you a first look at our latest launch: the Facial Spray with Aloe, Cucumber and Green Tea . “What is it?” It’s an invigorating facial mist that revives dull, tired skin with an infusion of nutrient-rich botanicals and Cucumber Essential Water. Aloe Vera and Cucumber—both rich in essential vitamins and minerals—deliver a cooling boost of hydration as Green Tea provides powerful antioxidant protection. “Where can I get it?” You can purchase Facial Spray with Aloe, Cucumber and Green Tea on MarioBadescu.com or find it at a store near you that carries MB! Shop it here . “What’s the difference between the two Facial Sprays?” There are a few differences; our goal was to formulate a facial mist that would complement the OG rosewater facial spray. Both boost hydration. Both also feature Aloe Vera for its soothing properties—but these are the main differences: Our cult-favorite Facial Spray with Aloe, Herbs and Rosewater was created to give skin a hydrated, dewy glow. With radiance-boosting and soothing botanicals like Rose, Gardenia, Thyme, Aloe, and skin-softening Bladderwrack (a type of seaweed), this is the ultimate pick-me-up product that leaves skin radiant. What we love it for : Boosting hydration in our moisturizing routine Misting over makeup as a final step for a flawless, dewy finish Rehydrating throughout the day, on the plane, everywhere basically Facial Spray with Aloe, Cucumber and Green Tea , has a little more zing to it. Like your morning, wake-me-up green tea (literally), with extra benefits. Infused with nutrient-rich botanicals (like Aloe Vera and Cucumber) and Cucumber Essential Water, our latest instantly invigorates and tones to perk up dull or tired skin. Green Tea provides a protective, antioxidant boost—leaving skin fresh and revitalized. What we love it for : Waking up tired skin in the morning Giving skin additional toning benefits after cleansing and toning Invigorating skin before, during, and after a workout Cooling skin on a hot, muggy day So, which do I need? It’s up to you! We recommend incorporating both in your regimen, but the beauty of these facial mists is in their versatility. Here at MB HQ, we love starting the day with Facial with Aloe, Cucumber and Green Tea to wake us up, then misting the original rosewater facial spray throughout the day to revive dehydrated skin. We’re also toting the new one in our gym bags —it’s a must during and post-workout as a super refreshing and cooling boost. The Facial Spray with Aloe, Herbs and Rosewater, however, take permanent residence in our travel bags ( here’s why .)

Spot treat whiteheads only! Some of us are naturally prone to using too much product. My sister, for example, somehow manages to use up every hair care/skin care product in my bathroom every time she visits. I don’t know what she’s doing in there, to be honest. If you’re using too much cleanser, moisturizer, eye cream, etc., you might not be getting the results that you want. More isn’t always better, especially when it comes to acne-fighting or anti-aging skin care, which usually have powerful active ingredients. Not sure how much moisturizer to use? What about cleanser Here’s what you need: Cleanser: a dime-sized amount Toner: Enough to soak your cotton ball or pad lightly Moisturizer: A nickel-sized amount. If you need more, you might simply require a more hydrating moisturizer. DON’T slather more moisturizer on dry skin—switch to one that’s more suited for you. Serums: 1-2 drops, depending on directions. (We include the number of drops in our directions!) Eye Cream: A (very small) pea-sized amount. Using too much eye cream can cause it to run into your eyes and irritate them. Acne Spot Treatments: Our Drying Lotion for Whiteheads is pretty powerful. Use sparingly on affected areas; it is not meant to be used all over the face. Related posts: Product Spotlight: Makeup Remover Soap Indulge with this gentle, non-stripping facial cleanser.

In light of gratitude and positive thinking, let’s approach skin care a little differently in 2018. What do you love about your skin? What does your skin crave? Start with the qualities you appreciate and work from there. For example: You love how dewy your skin looks even in the dead of winter, but you wouldn’t mind cutting back on some shine to maintain the balance. Easy solution : Use a clay-based mask a few times a week to help deep clean and absorb excess oil. Or, perhaps you’re grateful that breakouts are something you never have to worry about—but could use a little pick-me-up in the hydration department. The answer? Mist your complexion throughout the day with our hydrating facial spray , and layer up your serums and moisturizers . This New Year’s, make a resolution to carve out time for self-care—which means, taking care of your skin twice a day, seven days a week. Make that commitment, because you’re in it for the long haul. (We read somewhere that it only takes 21 days for something new to become a habit. Put in the elbow grease for three weeks and before you know it, you won’t be able to leave the house or go to bed without following your skin care routine.) Plus, in 10 years, you’ll be grateful you’ve held onto that resolution. Here’s how to get started. Never go to bed with makeup on . Ever. Cleanse twice daily . Here’s how to find your perfect face wash . Make it a mission to incorporate eye cream into your daily regimen . I’m the overachiever who keeps a jar of eye cream with me at all times ( true story, read more about it here ), but you could easily do just fine with applying it every morning and evening.

How often should you mask you ask? Funny you inquire. Resolution: Mask twice a week . Our aestheticians recommend up to three times a week depending on your skin type and concern(s).

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Subtitle":["Toners, astringent, cleansing lotion"],"Title":["Toner: Essential or Excessive?"],"url":"https://blog.mariobadescu.com/toner-astringent-8-20-2016/","Text":["Of the many types of skin care products that make up a well-rounded regimen, the most controversial category by far, is toner. Do we need them? Let’s find out! Doubters, naysayers, and conspiracy theorists alike have been warning the masses of the uselessness of toner and astringent for as long as I can remember. They have explained that this extra step is not only completely unnecessary but also a manipulative ploy by beauty pros to take up space in your medicine cabinet and lighten your wallet. On the other hand, the pro crowd will tell you that toners help to balance the skin post-cleanse. They will talk to you about how they will leave your skin feeling fresh and clean while whisking away the traces of dirt and makeup that are inevitably left behind after you splash away your facial cleanser. Now that that’s out there, I’d like to tell you the simple reason why I think that toner or astringent (or cleansing lotion as Mr. Badescu was partial to calling them) can be such a key, game-changing element to a skin care regimen: this step is a weightless way to deliver complexion-enhancing ingredients directly to your skin. Think of it as a cheat layer of skin care. Sweep it on and forget that it is even there. So, what does toner do, again? That depends on your individual skin care concerns. Sensitive skin? Calm down with Aloe Vera Toner . This formula is coveted by MB devotees with dry and sensitive skin and is a refreshing but gentle way to prep for moisturizer. Feeling dull? Brighten up Glycolic Acid Toner . Glycolic Acid is known for its ability to dissolve the dead skin cells that sit at the surface of the skin and dim your glow. Oily? Refresh with Cucumber Cleansing Lotion . This ultra-refreshing formula will wipe away excess oil and leave skin cool and clean. Prone to breakouts? Clarify with Special Cleansing Lotion C . Sulfur works to manage oil production and fight stubborn summertime breakouts. Where do you weigh in on this issue? Related posts: It’s Halloween! Happy Halloween!

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Kimberly Yang"],"url":"https://blog.mariobadescu.com/vitamin-c-serum-review/","Text":["It’s no secret I adore the Vitamin C Serum —I mean, I have since day one. It was only a matter of time before it became the hero product of a story—which brings us here today for an official declaration of my love to the little green bottle of anti-aging serum. I figured a list of reasons would be most appropriate—I’m a list-making type of girl, for one, and they’re easy on the eyes. Shall we? This is exactly what goes on in my mind when someone brings up the serum: The GLOW. It speaks for itself. Seeing is believing, and it’s a pretty sight I tell you. The anti-aging benefits. Anti-aging isn’t my main concern (I’m only 24), but preventive measures are key in any skincare regimen. Think for the long run. However, if you’re the instant gratification type, know this: good skin is a gradual process that takes consistency and diligence. It’s worth the addition into your current routine because the results are tangible. Anti-aging properties? Great. But it’s what the Vitamin C Serum does for my skin within a week that has me head over heels. (At this point only clichés can convey how much I love this product.) Seriously. The glow . The radiance. It’s imperative I reiterate just how crucial this is in achieving that dewy complexion. Highlighters and other pretty, shimmery powders optional . One of our MB staffers, Mei, calls this our little “superstar” product. I know the little bottle of pink is an all-time favorite, but go green! Give the green a chance. (Mei is also responsible for getting me hooked.) Skin becomes noticeably softer and smoother to the touch. It’s like an instant pick-me-up for tired skin. I never travel without this . After flying, I’m exhausted, dehydrated, and looking a little more sallow than I like. The moment I check into my hotel, I give my face a good cleanse and apply the Vitamin C Serum all over. The difference it makes in a few minutes is astounding. I have my fair share of skincare woes, but lately people have been making a point of telling me that I have good skin. Call it a congratulatory high-five for getting over the hump of the hormone-raging teen years, but I think it’s the result of obsessively diligently using a moisturizer twice daily, and the Vitamin C Serum every other night (or under masks as a mini spa treatment). This is it. A good moisturizer and Vitamin C Serum, together, is the recipe for beautiful skin. . . . Do you love the Vitamin C Serum as much as I do?

You can imagine how much fun I had this weekend at home in my pajamas and a messy bun watching my favorite reality housewives duke it out while I cared for my face with my weekly at-home facial starring Mario Badescu. In celebration of beautiful, happy skin everywhere, I wanted to share with you one of my all-time favorites from our line: Facial Spray with Aloe, Herbs and Rosewater . The first time I tried this bottle of pink mist, I followed my basic skin care regimen, which includes a cleanser, toner, exfoliant, eye cream and moisturizer. Then I applied foundation, gave my face a light spritz and I was hooked. This lovely little product had the ability to somehow make my skin feel both recharged and soothed, while setting my makeup in place. The aromatic scent of rosewater, herbs, and aloe is evocative enough to transport even the most die-hard spa-goer’s mind to a relaxing visit at the day spa. This formula is great for all skin types, and anyone who loves feeling hydrated should enjoy the refreshing feeling of this spray. You can use it with or without makeup, and it comes in a portable size that can be easily stored. In addition, this year-round favorite hydrates the skin after exposure to indoor heat and air conditioning. (Double bonus!) I find myself spritzing my face any time I need a pick-me-up.

Among my little circle of friends, Mario Badescu’s Facial Spray with Aloe, Herbs and Rosewater has achieved cult status. The obsession over Mario Badescu’s Facial Spray began with one girl in our group. She’s been a Mario Badescu fan for years and when she moved to our area she brought her excellent skin and skin care products with her. These days, the use of this spray has spread like wildfire. Passed around while doing our makeup before going out and slipped into gift bags during the holidays, I know that I will find a bottle of this in the medicine cabinet of any acquaintance. When we’re shopping or having a night out, you can be sure that at least one of us always has a small bottle tucked in her purse. In case you’re unfamiliar with the spray, it is a multi-purpose hydrating mist that can be used anywhere, anytime, and on all skin types. You can even spray it in your hair. It’s fantastic for adding moisture when you’re stuck with overzealous air conditioning or heat and it’s the perfect thing for setting your makeup. So many of you have left lovely reviews on our website for this spray (after all, what’s more fun than sharing your favorite products with others, right?) and we appreciate your time. In fact, we thought we’d share some of your reviews right here on our blog. Here’s what you had to say about our Facial Spray! Corrie H. in Massachusetts says: Fabulous! This spray is what I have been looking for for years! I use a mineral based powder foundation and this helps to set my makeup and make it not look so powdery and more natural. I use this spray every single day and would be lost without it! It is also very refreshing, smells amazing and adds a nice bit of moisture. Love it! And Maria H. (also in Massachessetts) reports: This spray mist is so wonderful! I like that it is non-irritating because of my eczema-intolerant skin. It is so calming, gentle, hydrating! I use it for my neck-face-hair! … When I wear makeup I use this to set my makeup. Also nice to use as a light gentle fragrance! Try it you will love it! Finally, Julie K. from New York tells us: This is the first thing on my skin after my shower. It relieves the tight skin feeling and it allows my moisturizer to absorb better. I also use this to set my makeup. This stuff is great to use if you have oily skin. … It is very fresh feeling and it is great! A must-have for oily skin. Thanks!

Cheers to beauty resolutions that make all the difference—also happen to be beauty resolutions you can keep (BRYCK ) too. How are we doing with the water intake so far , ladies and gents? Good, I hope, because we’re moving onto our second Beauty Resolution You Can Keep: Resolution: Remove your makeup every night. Sleeping in makeup is bad for you, period. Save yourself the dull skin and mascara-stained sheets and remove your makeup every night. Seriously: Nothing will make a more noticeable difference to your skin than removing your makeup properly on a nightly basis. And by properly, we mean the whole she-bang: eye makeup remover , cleanser , toner . No skimping. No makeup wipes. (You deserve better than that.) In a matter of days your skin will feel more refreshed. It’ll look brighter. Your makeup will apply better, your skincare will absorb and work better. It’s likely you’ll see your skin clear up, or feel less dry. And with products these days geared towards longevity (24-hour wear eyeshadows, 16-hour liquid lipsticks, waterproof mascaras, anyone?), it’s more important than ever to find the makeup remover that works well—and jives with your skin. Our personal office favorites? The Carnation Eye Makeup Remover Oil and Eye Makeup Remover Gel (Non-Oily) . Both are gentle formulations great for all skin types and especially effective at removing heavy makeup; the difference in texture is a matter of personal preference. I’m partial to the former because I how easily it breaks down my waterproof mascara, but I love the latter for fixing mistakes during makeup application (its non-greasy formula lets you apply makeup straight away!). Simply moisten a cotton pad or flannel with the eye makeup remover and press gently on the eyelids and lashes. Leave on (with eyes closed, of course) for a few seconds before wiping down in a downward direction. Repeat until the cotton/flannel comes up clean, then follow with cleanser and toner. It takes an extra five minutes. But trust: it makes a world of a difference. . . .

So while we’re all trying to stay warm without leaving the house resembling the abominable snowman, let’s talk winter skin for a second. Colder, harsher weather requires an upgrade in the hydration and anti-aging department. (Dry skin tends to show fine lines, wrinkles, and other signs of aging more, FYI!)

And while there is no magic product that will instantly smooth these lines, there are definitely things that you can do to help improve their appearance and prevent them in the first place. Crow’s feet are the horizontal lines that start at the outer corners of the eyes and extend toward the temples. They tend to become visible when we smile or squint. When you combine these common facial expressions with the fact that the skin around the eyes is thinner and more delicate than the skin on the rest of your face, it is easy to see why these wrinkles are so common. Here are our favorite #MBSkinTips for dealing with crow’s feet: #1 Squinting? Sunglasses are your best friend, find a pair you love and don’t leave home without them. #2 Hydrate. Dehydration enhances the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, including crow’s feet. Drink your daily recommended amount of water and use an eye cream formulated with ingredients that bind moisture to the skin like our Hyaluronic Eye Cream . #3 Look for products that contain Peptides. Collagen in the skin starts to diminish as we age, which leads to loss of firmness and elasticity. Peptides work to encourage the rebuilding of this lost collagen. Targeted products like our Cellufirm Drops and Dermonectin Eye Cream are made with this collagen-boosting ingredient. #4 Protect your skin from the sun. The most effective way to ward off premature signs of aging is to shield your skin from the damaging rays of the sun. Wide-brimmed hats and umbrellas help as will applying a bit of Oil Free Moisturizer SPF 30 away from the eyes and onto the temples where crow’s feet tend to form. #5 Never stop smiling.

We know you love your toner, but unless you’re a beauty YouTuber racking up used products for an “empties video,” those bottles need to go. You deserve a fresh one! That pack of face wipes is all dried up . You know you should not be using those as a sole cleansing method, right? (Face wash and eye makeup removers are non-negotiable in every cleansing regimen!) Toss out those wipes, make a pact to never buy them again, and replace an Enzyme Cleansing Gel in its spot. Your mask is all dried up too, which can mean one of two things : (1) you didn’t like that mask much and still kept it for whatever reason, or (2) you barely reached for it. Masks are supposed to be used regularly—2 time a week—and thus are meant to last a year max. If you’re not sure what kind of mask you should be using, take this skin analysis to get a recommendation from a skincare specialist. And remember: mask often to keep your skin in tip-top shape. You’re not quite sure what that jar used to be . If the label’s grubby or all worn off, TOSS it. Expired or bacteria-infested profits from being kept too long or stored improperly are no joke. Better to be safe than sorry. Your cotton swabs are looking a little dusty . Don’t think twice; kick ’em to the curb. Chances are, you’re using them for to dot on your Drying Lotion , and the last thing you want to do is have a whole bunch of germs and dirt further clogging up that pesky spot. Storing your Q-Tips in that mini Diptyque candle may be cute when you #doitforthegram, but it’s not the most sanitary way to do it.

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Kimberly Yang"],"url":"https://blog.mariobadescu.com/the-monthly-edit-glowing-for-july/","Text":["If there’s an ideal time to glow hard, it’s now. We want clear, radiant, and luminous skin for the summer (well, all year-round actually—but let’s not get ahead of ourselves just yet!), so these are the skincare products we’re reaching for all July long: Glycolic Foaming Cleanser : Part cleanser and part exfoliant, this multi-tasking hybrid deep cleans skin of pore-clogging impurities while rejuvenating dull skin. Glycolic Acid retexturizes uneven skin and helps brighten areas of discoloration—leaving the complexion clearer, smoother, and more youthful-looking. #MBSkinTip : Got bumps or breakouts on your neck, chest, back, arms, or legs? Don’t be afraid to incorporate the Glycolic Foaming Cleanser into your body regimen, too. Use it one to three times a week (just as you would for your face) to target those troubled areas. Special Cucumber Lotion : Sometimes you need a little extra somethin’-somethin’. To help keep excess oil and problem-prone skin in check, give your skin a good sweep with this clarifying toner. Botanical Exfoliating Scrub : We love how this scrub leaves our face feeling fresh—but we love using it on our body, too. To help keep summer skin soft, smooth, and glowing from head to toe, we make sure we give our skin a good polish two to three times a week. Orange Tonic Mask : Weekends should be spent masking while indulging in new summer reads. The Orange Tonic Mask is our treat of choice (and no, not just because it smells like the creamsicles of our youth, spent hailing ice cream trucks from a mile away) because it’s formulated with Orange Peel to rejuvenate and natural minerals to help purify and tighten the appearance of pores. Silver Powder : Bust blackheads and T-zone congestion with this unique treatment. Simply dampen a cotton pad, dip it into the white powder, and pat it wherever you need clarifying. Facial Spray with Aloe, Herbs and Rosewater : This mist never leaves our beloved medicine cabinet, but now that we’re averaging 90-degree days, we’re storing Facial Spray in our fridge instead. Nothing beats a cooling, refreshing boost on a hot summer day. A.H.A. & Ceramide Moisturizer : Lightweight, radiance-boosting hydration is exactly what skin needs this summer. Citrus Body Cleanser : Smells like summer. Feels like summer, too. . . .

Sure, it takes a little more finesse when finding the perfect combination, but what’s a little trial and error once you find a regimen that just works ? Got combo-oily skin? Me too! Here’s a threesome that works brilliantly for keeping combo-oily skin healthy, happy, and balanced: 1. Enzyme Cleansing Gel . Think of this cleanser as the anchor in your regimen: It cleanses, brightens, and refreshes your skin of any dulling or pore-clogging buildup without overdrying skin. It’s gentle on skin, but effective at reducing T-zone shine—making it the ideal face wash to keep on hand during the warmer months. 2. Kiwi Face Scrub . Exfoliation is #majorkey when it comes to keeping your complexion in check…especially if your skin veers on the oilier side. Regular exfoliation should be implemented into your regimen 2-3 times a week to help brighten, soften, and smooth your complexion. What makes the Kiwi Face Scrub a combo-oily essential is the Kiwi Seeds themselves. Because of their small, firm texture, they’re able to polish away surface buildup to reveal healthier, clearer, more radiant skin. 3. Seaweed Night Cream . The Seaweed Night Cream is unique in that it’s an oil-free formula—an uncommon feat in the night cream territory—but still boasts a luxe, silky texture that makes it a dream to apply before bed. Mineral-rich Bladderwrack Extract (a marine botanical), Sodium Hyaluronate (a powerful humectant), Collagen, and Elastin combine in this skin-plumping formula that enhances your skin’s tone and texture and reveals a dewy complexion come morning. This is one of those products you just have to see and feel for yourself—because once you experience it first-hand, you’ll fall in love. . . .

Thank goodness for progress. . . . 2800 B.C. The very first soap is invented in ancient Babylon. Legend holds that its name derives from Mount Sapo, a sacrificial site. 1000 B.C. You are what you eat , said the holistic Ancient Chinese (more elaborately, though). 1550 B.C. When in Egypt… do as the ancient Egyptians once did. Queens soaked in milk baths , exfoliated with pumice stones and massaged their skin with Aloe Vera for beautiful skin. Pyramids first, skincare second. 476 A.D. The fall of Rome also meant the end of bathing and personal cleansing habits. (A shame, really – let’s be thankful it’s 2013.) 500 – 1000 A.D. Let the Early Middle Ages be remembered not for their supposed poor hygiene, but for the birth of apothecaries that dispensed increasingly elaborate herbal concoctions. 1000s – 1400s Sun protection was all the rage. Medieval maidens also begin to tackle blemishes … using amethyst. Did you know? According to Elle.com , “medieval maidens tighten[ed] their skin with a cream made of chickpeas, barley, almonds, horseradish seeds, and milk.” 1400s – 1500s While skincare and cosmetics remained relatively the same (albeit a little more hazardous), the skincare philosophy was less about the appearance of attractiveness, and more about personal cleanliness. 1600s – 1700s Two opposing skincare philosophies came to be: Baroque extravagance versus Puritan minimalism. Makeup versus the natural complexion ; perfumed “makeup-removing” soaps versus a simple splash of water . Baroque or Puritanical? Which skincare philosophy would you have followed?

Dehydrated, tight skin needs extra help from night creams and richly hydrating moisturizers. Not so much during the summer. Having Dry Skin technically means that your skin simply doesn’t produce a lot of oil. But hot, humid weather helps the skin avoid becoming dehydrated and itchy. As long as you’re using broad spectrum sun protection during the day, you’ve got it made in the shade, right? You still need to moisturize. The key is to choose something that’s lightweight and soothing. If you’re looking for the perfect summer moisturizer for Dry Skin, we’d definitely recommend giving the Buttermilk Moisturizer a closer look. It’s really lightweight but provides just the right amount of moisture. Plus, it includes Lactic Acid to gently exfoliate and revitalize your skin.

In fact, I was just saying it last night to a friend of mine. There are certain people who amaze me simply because of the amount of accomplishments they accumulate in one lifetime. Whenever I get on this topic my go-to examples of this type of mystical person are always the same, Martha Stewart and Oprah Winfrey. I will eternally be amazed by these women and the accomplishments they have made on so many levels. Chances are I won’t be launching my own network in this lifetime, but I must say I am always tickled when I notice similarities between myself and these ladies. My love of literature and inclinations toward spirituality . . . totally Oprah. My overwhelming desire to make cauliflower soup from scratch the minute the temperature drops below 70. . . how much more Martha can you be? As many of you probably know, this past Tuesday Martha and Oprah united when Martha was a guest on The Oprah Winfrey Show (Goosebumps!). I could barely breathe when Martha presented Oprah with a gift basket containing (amongst other surely wonderful goodies) Mario Badescu products! Not only were these Mario Badescu products, but included in the basket were the exact hand cream and facial spray that I cannot live without. Just the notion that the three of us could possibly have something in common is almost too much for me to process. I now have to wonder what else we three have in common? Is pizza their favorite food too? Do they set their alarm clocks a half hour early so that they can press snooze at least twice before waking up also? I may be a media mogul myself before I have the answers to these questions but at least for now I know we have the same skin care products.

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Lee Ann"],"url":"https://blog.mariobadescu.com/how-to-remove-eye-makeup/","Text":["Getting rid of stubborn eye makeup can be frustrating—especially when dealing with waterproof formulas. Your first inclination may be to tug at the skin when attempting to remove makeup, but this consistent tugging can lead to premature wrinkling. So what is the proper way to remove eye makeup? Here’s how professional estheticians are trained to remove eye makeup: soak a cotton ball or pad with the eye makeup remover of your choice and gently press on the eyelids and lashes for a moment. Let the makeup remover sit there, dissolving your eye makeup and making it easier to remove. When you’re ready, gently wipe in a downward motion, repeating carefully as necessary. A careful upward motion along the lower lash line will remove any traces of makeup lingering there. Never tug or pull at the eye area. The skin in this area is some of the thinnest skin on your body and is usually the first area to show signs of aging.

Take advantage of the weekend to reach for a few powerhouse products each evening—your friends will wonder how you manage to look so fresh-faced at brunch. Going out? We know, your week was insane—you made it through! It’s Friday, you’re tired, but you just. . .want. . .to. . .go. . .out. Only for a few hours and a few drinks—you know, to feel human, and to have fun. You’re running on fumes and you are going to use those fumes to dance! Going out this weekend? Temporary Lifting Mask is made for parties. Apply this mask to clean skin and leave on for 7 minutes before removing. It gives your skin an instant boost so you can power through the night like the champ that you are! Pop a jar of Ceramide Eye Gel into the refrigerator before you get into the shower. When you are ready, gently apply the cool gel to the under eye area to hydrate, refresh, and help to reduce puffiness—a virtual disco nap when there’s no time for one! Staying in? Sometimes nothing seems more luxurious than a night in. For some, Friday and Saturday nights can be that magical window of time when you can slip off the radar. These are the few waking hours when emails stop (or at least slow), kids sleep (maybe), and you can just be calm, clear your mind (or watch mindless TV), and restore. Holing up for the weekend? Remove makeup and cleanse then give the skin a gentle massage with Almond and Honey Face Scrub . Use the pads of your index and middle fingers to lightly go over the skin in upward, circular motions for about 30 seconds, then rinse. Next apply a thin layer of Azulene Calming Mask to the face, avoiding the eyes. This gentle detoxifying mask is great for just about everyone, especially those with sensitive skin. Follow with a giant mug of tea and your coziest throw blanket. About that brunch, are we ordering something sweet or savory?

Cleansing is so, so important when it comes to keeping skin looking as healthy as it can be. Treat the skin on the rest of your body as would your face—don’t just cleanse it with any ol’ bar soap and think it’ll do. (It won’t. Bar soaps won’t strip your skin of essential moisture and leave behind a residue that can clog pores, which lead to breakouts). For daily use, our aestheticians always suggest A.H.A. Botanical Body Soap for troubled skin; it has revitalizing alpha hydroxy acids that help dissolve away excess oil, dirt, and dead skin cells to help reveal clearer-looking skin. Two to three times a week, try using the Glycolic Foaming Cleanser on affected areas (like your back, chest, arms, and/or behind the legs). 2. Tone . You know toner is crucial to your cleansing routine, so why would your bodycare regimen be any different? You’ll find that a quick sweep of Special Cucumber Cleansing Lotion “O” (which was specially formulated for targeting troubled skin on the body) will remove excess sebum and leave your skin feeling that much more refreshed. 3. Target problem areas . Two times a week, apply a thin, even layer of the Drying Mask onto trouble spots to deep clean skin and help dry up surface blemishes. Leave on for 15-20 minutes, rinse off well, and follow with the Special Cleansing Lotion “O.” For added reinforcement, you can use our Drying Lotion , Buffering Lotion , or Drying Cream to further target spots while you sleep. . . .

After all, September (a.k.a. Back-To-School) is all about returning to the basics . The goal isn’t to stir things up—we know seasonal changes and new beginnings can be stressful—it’s to go back to the tried-and-true favorites we trust. The result? You’re able to help your skin maintain balance and achieve healthier, clearer-looking skin. To help you put your best face forward no matter what, keep these back-to-school basics in your skincare stash: Enzyme Cleansing Gel Perfect for all skin types, this refreshing face wash is infused with alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) and natural fruit enzymes (found in Papaya and Grapefruit Extracts) to provide effective—but gentle—exfoliation. Dulling dead skin cells and pore-clogging oils are removed from the surface to ensure that your complexion looks and feels rejuvenated. #MBSkinTip : Leave the cleanser on your skin for an extra minute or so to allow more time for the AHAs to work their magic. Then, massage the gel into your face once more before rinsing well with warm water. Facial Spray with Aloe, Herbs and Rosewater This cult-favorite facial mist is a must-have—so much so that we keep one at home and one in our backpack. To help wake up tired skin and boost hydration during those early mornings, we love a good spritz before we apply our moisturizer and after makeup application. You can also revive dull or oily skin throughout the day—simply mist your face whenever, wherever. #MBSkinTip : Keep one in your gym locker to help refresh your hair, face, and body. Drying Lotion Pesky problems seem to pop up when you least expect them to—or right before Picture Day (or a big meeting). Our solution? Nip it in the bud while you sleep . Simply dip a clean cotton swab into the pink sediment, dab the product directly on any surface blemishes, and go to sleep. It’s that simple. . . .

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Kimberly Yang"],"url":"https://blog.mariobadescu.com/10-tips-glowing-summer-skin/","Text":["Always apply sunscreen . Sun protection is crucial to skin health—in fact, it’s one of the most surefire ways to prevent premature signs of aging (like fine lines, wrinkles, and sagging) and discoloration (like age spots and darkening of post-acne marks). Be sure to apply first thing every morning or 20 minutes prior to any outdoor activities; re-apply every hour to ensure your skin stays protected throughout the day, especially if you’re going to be spending time during the sun’s peak hours (11 a.m. to 3 p.m.). For combination/oily, oily, or acne-prone skin: Oil Free Moisturizer SPF 30 For combination/dry skin: Hyaluronic Moisturizer SPF 15 For dry or mature skin: The Moisture Magnet SPF 15 Protect your hands and feet. Yes, driving and walking around in open-toed shoes makes you susceptible to sun damage and premature signs of aging. Be sure to exfoliate, moisturize, and protect exposed hands and feet. Our tip? Keep a bottle of Oil Free Moisturizer SPF 30 on hand when you’re out and about. It’ll not only keep your hands and feet hydrated, but will also sink in quickly without feeling greasy—all while protecting your skin. Exfoliate regularly . It’s essential to glowing skin : By removing pore-clogging surface impurities and dulling dead skin cells from the skin, exfoliation helps diminish discoloration and prevent future breakouts. The Glycolic Foaming Cleanser has been a total game-changer for most of us at MB HQ—but if you prefer a granular exfoliant, give our invigorating Botanical Exfoliating Scrub instead. Moisture matters . Summer sun, heat, salt water, chlorine, and air conditioning can wreak havoc on skin. To help keep skin hydrated and healthy-looking, moisturize with SPF before sun, and use a night cream before bed. And for glowing, silky-smooth skin from head to toe, be sure to moisturize your hands and body too. Don’t skimp on eye cream . Sun exposure will gradually thin skin and cause wrinkles, so it’s essential to make eye care a priority. Try using a lightweight formula for day, and a creamier version overnight so you wake up with plumper, younger-looking under-eyes. Throw on a baseball cap or large, floppy beach hat to help further shield your face, neck, and chest from dangerous UVA/UVB rays. Look for alpha/beta hydroxy acids in your skincare* . Even if you’re already exfoliating, your skin can always use a boost in further brightening and smoothing the complexion. Ingredients like Grapefruit Extract , Papaya Extract , Lactic Acid , Glycolic Acid , and Salicylic Acid help take your daily regimen to the next level. *Broad spectrum protection is more important than ever if you’re using AHAs and BHAs. Because these ingredients are constantly encouraging the removal of dead skin cells to reveal fresher, newer skin, sunscreen is crucial in keep skin looking even. Vitamin C is key. Specifically, a Vitamin C Serum . Detox . Use a purifying mask 2-3 times a week to deep clean skin, absorb excess T-zone shine, and reveal a refreshed, healthy-looking complexion. Keep hydrated . Drink water throughout the day. If you’re on the go, bring a water bottle and container of fresh fruit to prevent dehydration. Be sure to keep a bottle of Facial Spray on hand to rehydrate skin, too! Make the healthy switch . As tempting as it is to lie in a tanning bed or sunbathe, make the switch to self-tanners to achieve that ever-covetable summer skin without yielding yourself to the dangers of overexposure. Beauty Tip: Our faces will always be a shade or two lighter than our body; to build color on your face as well, alternate between a tinted moisturizer and facial self-tanner to achieve an even wash of sun-kissed color. . . .

Last month was all about fixing winter skin—and now that it finally feels like spring here in NYC, we can fully commit to the Glow-with-a-capital-G. ( For our colder-climate peeps who are still feeling the effects of winter weather, check out our guide on how to recuperate your skin and revive your complexion here ! ) These are the skincare products we’re using to achieve that effervescent, spring-has-sprung glow: Acne Facial Cleanser Before you keep scrolling, this face wash isn’t only for acne skin. Combination skin—especially come spring and summer—can benefit from this too. During this time of the year your skin can get a little temperamental. As it adjusts to the warmer weather, combo skin tends to experience increased oiliness, T-zone congestion, and the occasional pimple or two. So, rather than sit and wait for all that to happen, get ahead of the game. Take preventative measures by incorporating the Acne Facial Cleanser into your daily regimen. Its Salicylic Acid content is what helps keep skin in check. Exfoliating properties of Salicylic Acid enable it to deep clean and help dissolve pore-clogging impurities known to lead to breakouts or blackheads. And though this cleanser is incredibly effective at promoting clarity, it’s gentle—which means skin won’t feel dry or tight. Cucumber Cleansing Lotion It’s cooling, it’s clarifying, it’s Cucumber. And before we make you sick with alliteration, two things: Cucumber boasts natural astringent and tightening properties that make it a must-have for clarifying combination, oily skin. Those mysterious things floating around in your bottle aren’t so mysterious. They’re slices of real Cucumber. J A.H.A. & Ceramide Moisturizer This lightweight, multi-tasking moisturizer hydrates and boosts brightness. Ceramides soften and smooth as Lemon and Lemongrass work to rejuvenate dull skin while diminishing the look of discoloration. Herbal Hydrating Serum Think of the A.H.A. & Ceramide Moisturizer as your brightening base and the Herbal Hydrating Serum as your glow-getting topper. Apply this water-light gel wherever you need extra hydration or want to give your complexion a dewy finish—like around the nose and apples of your cheeks. Facial Spray with Aloe, Herbs and Rosewater Mist on clean skin before moisturizer, then mist again after makeup for even more radiance. Like I said earlier: We’re going full throttle with this glow-getting theme. All. Or. Nothing. And it doesn’t stop here. Enzyme Revitalizing Mask Let this be your mid-week pick-me-up and weekend spa treat. Perfect for dull, tired skin in need of a major boost, this mask does exactly what its name says it does: revitalize. For those who like instant gratification, this is a must for your glowing skin regimen. Summer Shine Body Lotion Sometimes you just want that extra oomph. This is it: It’s pure, tropical deliciousness that’s been infused with a fine shimmer…which means it lives up to its name and then some . With a subtle golden glimmer and a hint of summer vacations to come, Summer Shine Body Lotion is exactly what you need to achieve that glow (or when you need a pick-me-up). We love applying it wherever the sun would naturally hit our skin: the front of our legs, top of the shoulders, down the arm, and décolletage.

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Lee Ann"],"url":"https://blog.mariobadescu.com/party/","Text":["The holidays are here and, with them, holiday parties. If you have shindigs to attend, now is the time to prep your skin to ensure you look smashing for the event. Here is my personal “secret recipe” for pre-party prep (I do this the day of the big event). When I do these steps, I look glowing and always receive compliments on my skin. Keep in mind that I have combination skin: I’m combo/dry during the cooler months and combo/oily throughout the warmer season, so this “recipe” may or may not work for you. 1. Cleanse I start off by cleansing my face with either our Seaweed Cleansing Soap or the Enzyme Cleansing Gel . If my skin is on the dry side, I use the Seaweed Cleansing Soap, and if it is leaning toward oily, I stick with the Enzyme Cleansing Gel. 2. Exfoliate Next, I mechanically exfoliate with our Almond & Honey Face Scrub in gentle circular motions. 3. Face Mask Application Our Temporary Lifting Mask , which, as the name indicates, is designed to prep the skin for special events as it temporarily tightens the face. Great for any skin type, it contains Calamine, Egg protein and Rose Petal Extract. 4. Tone For an extra kick of exfoliating action (chemical exfoliation, in this case), I swipe our Glycolic Acid Toner all over my face and neck. (This is my favorite toner.) 5. Treat We’re almost done! Next, I apply a few drops of our Vitamin C Serum all over my face and neck for a boost of antioxidants and to amp up the glow factor. 6. Moisturize Since I normally perform this regimen at night, I use a moisturizer without sunscreen and opt for our Buttermilk Moisturizer (when my skin is a little dry) or our A.H.A. & Ceramide Moisturizer when my skin is oilier. 7. Perk Up Right before I leave for the event, I give a quick spritz or two on my face with our Facial Spray with Aloe, Herbs & Rosewater for a dewy finish. This is done after I apply my makeup for the night. So now that the secret’s out…give it a try before your next big event!

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Nicole Darmanin"],"url":"https://blog.mariobadescu.com/best-face-scrub-type/","Text":["Fact: Exfoliation is not something that is difficult to get people on board with. Reason: Humans love to use face scrub, and by humans I mean me, probably you . . . and almost everyone. Who doesn’t love that extra-smooth feeling of freshly scrubbed skin? It’s addictive. As a skin pro, I spend much more time trying to convince overachieving exfoliators to take a rest day than I do preaching the benefits of using a scrub in the first place. In addition to the instant gratification that exfoliation provides, doing it regularly encourages cell turnover (in other words, it triggers the body to produce beautiful, brand new baby skin cells to replace the old, dull ones that you are sloughing away). Most importantly, properly exfoliated skin is better able to absorb the serums and moisturizers applied onto it. That’s right kids— (#MBSkinTip in 3 . . . 2 . . .) proper exfoliation makes the rest of your products work better. Now that we’ve established why we are all such motivated exfoliators, let’s determine which face scrub is the best fit for you. If you like to take a gentle approach to exfoliation, snag a jar of Strawberry or Kiwi Face Scrub . Cornmeal and actual fruit seeds work to brighten. Is your skin on the sensitive side? Almond & Honey Face Scrub is formulated with detoxifying Kaolin Clay, skin-softening Honey, and moisturizing Sweet Almond Oil. Ground Almonds and Cornmeal gently buff away dullness. #MBSkinTip: Almond and Honey Scrub can play double-duty as an ultra-gentle face mask. After exfoliating, let it set for 10 minutes before you rinse! If you like the feeling of a micro-fine exfoliant (sans microbeads!), you will love Botanical Exfoliating Scrub . This luxe, gel-based formula is brimming with good-for-your-skin natural ingredients including: Coconut Extract, Green Tea, Ginger, and Gingko Biloba. Skin is left smooth and perfectly polished. Acne-erupted skin is delicate and may not be able to tolerate manual exfoliation (aka grainy scrubs), so get the smooth without the scrub by swapping your daily cleanser for Glycolic Foaming Cleanser three times per week.

Should I skip cleansing twice daily if my skin is dry? My skin always feels super dry and tight after washing my face, even more so now that it’s cold out. It’s important to cleanse twice daily no matter your skin type and no matter the season—it’s just about finding the right face wash that suits your skin’s needs. So: if your skin feels dry, tight, or even sensitive after cleansing, it’s likely you’re not using the right kind of face wash. Which leads us to… Q . What’s the best face cleanser for dry, winter skin? A . Mario Badescu aestheticians recommend using a cream or tissue-off cleanser. Both are gentle alternatives to bar soaps or foaming formulas: they get rid of the dirt, oil, and impurities, but leave your skin feeling soft and nourished. Here’s how to find the best face wash that’ll keep your dry skin happy all winter long: Got combo/dry skin and love a rejuvenating boost in your cleanser? Try Orange Cleansing Soap , a comforting face wash infused with Orange Peel Extract that refreshes skin of light makeup, dirt, oil, and other surface impurities. #MBSkinTip : If you love Enzyme Cleansing Gel in the warmer months but are looking for a winter alternative, you’ll love this face wash, too. Got combination/dry skin that’s prone to uneven skin tone and texture? You’ll love Seaweed Cleansing Soap , a fresh, creamy face wash formulated with marine botanicals. Surface impurities are washed away, but your complexion is left softer and smoother than before. Plus, there are real seaweed grains in there to gently buff away dulling dead skin cells. Got dry, sensitive skin that looks dull? Use Keratoplast Cream Soap , a unique cleanser that helps rid the skin of pore-clogging impurities without leaving skin feeling parched. Got dry skin? Start using Cucumber Cream Soap , a creamy, Cucumber-infused face wash that leaves skin feeling soft, fresh, and hydrated. Got super sensitive and dry skin? Try Cream Soap . It’s a simple, gentle formula that was created specifically for delicate skin. It’s an oil-free, fragrance-free, moisturizing formula that cleanses without overdrying skin. Got super dry, parched, and/or mature skin ? Or maybe you love wearing a full face of heavy makeup? Your skin will love Cleansing Milk with Carnation & Rice Oil . Makeup and surface impurities are instantly wiped clean without stripping dry skin of essential moisture; instead, this oil-based cleansing milk ensures skin feels soft and nourished.

You may have found your man, but you still need your girls. These are the ladies who have been by your side through it all (the good, the bad and through sickness and in health). Show them you love them and couldn’t be more grateful. As adorable as an engraved key ring or a personalized glass is, nothing says thank you or that you truly care than the gift of skincare. Give the gift most wouldn’t have the effort or time to spend on themselves. You know your girls – you know their skincare woes, what they’ve tried and loved, and what they need. It’s not a bridesmaid gift without a personalized something or other; let’s call it a tradition made true through time. Have a cosmetic bag embroidered with her name or initial – there’s no doubt it’s something girls always need, want, and will use. It’s all about giving the gift that is not only meaningful , but useful as well. Fill it with fun things. Little photo booth photos, mementos, lilac confetti hearts. A favorite lip gloss, a guilty pleasure chocolate. A bottle of nail varnish matching the theme of your wedding. Then stuff it with skincare goodies you know she’ll love… … a mini bottle of the Rosewater Facial Spray , because it’s an essential in every girl’s skincare kit (and nothing says love better than a whiff of pretty roses). … a mask, so she remembers that she deserves a bit of R&R for herself; perhaps the beloved Orange Tonic ? The Calma to de-stress? The Temporary Lifting Mask for a truly at-home facial? You decide. … a jar of our Raspberry Body Scrub , because nothing says luxurious better than a head-to-toe exfoliation before a girl’s night out. … and last but not least, a little serum to remind her that she deserves that extra mile, that extra luxury . The Herbal Hydrating Serum so she gets that dewy glow year-round, or a bottle of the uber lush Vitamin C Serum so she feels like Julia Restoin-Roitfeld every so often. Go crazy; go wild.

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Subtitle":["hand model"],"Title":["So You Want to Be a Hand Model?"],"url":"https://blog.mariobadescu.com/hand-model/","Text":["You know, for #armcandy or #mani of the day pics on Instagram. 1. Change the way you cleanse . Most hand soaps—especially after multiple washings (we hope!) throughout the day– leave skin feeling dry, tight, and not Insta-worthy. To keep hands clean without overdrying, I actually keep a bottle of Cucumber Cream Soap at the sink. It’s gentle and skin soothing on skin, just as an effective cleanser should be. 2. Rehydrate frequently . Dry hands can look ashy or crepe-y IRL and in photos. Always keep a bottle of hand cream—by the sink, in your bag, at your desk, in your car—for whenever the need arises. I actually keep the Oil Free Moisturizer SPF 30 in my car in case I forget to apply SPF (hands are one of the first places to show signs of aging!) before driving; plus, it sinks in quickly so I’m not left with greasy fingerprints all over the steering wheel. The Hydrating Hand Cream travels with me wherever I go, and I have tub of my favorite — Special Hand Cream with Vitamin E —at my desk and nightstand. When you’re typing or writing all day, you know: hands go through a lot of wear and tear, and the best thing you can do for it is to take care of ‘em. (FYI: this cream has a rich yet whipped texture, which makes it a total pleasure to apply.) 3. Start an anti-aging regimen now. Yes, for your hands. And yes, now. We’ll say it again: hand are one of the first areas on the body to show signs of aging due to constant use/handwashing, lack of proper care (we take our of faces, but what about the rest of our body?), and thinner skin. Take precautions now. Apply SPF before drying or going outdoors. Hydrate hands frequently—and look for hand creams with antioxidant-rich formulas to further defend against free radicals that can age skin prematurely. 4. Exfoliate for softer, smoother, and more even-toned skin. Our hands are one of the spots we tend to forget to exfoliate . Next time you exfoliate your face, use any excess remainders on the backs of your hands. It’ll be a surefire way to help you remember and not let any product go to waste, and a definite hand model move. 5. Use serums on the backs of your hands . I’ve taken to using drop of Vitamin C Serum on both hands prior to applying hand cream; it’s been a crucial step of my evening regimen since reading up on Jill’s tip a few weeks ago . I have some hyperpigmentation and scarring that’s been stubborn to fade the past few years, but since incorporating Vitamin C Serum into my hand care routine, the spots are nearly gone. Try it. I implore you. My mom has followed suit, using the Peptide Renewal Serum as a moisture-intensive treatment that also targets fine lines, wrinkles, and loss of elasticity. 6. Treat your hands once a week . I’ll slather on serum, hand cream, and Cuticle Cream before slipping my hands into cotton gloves as an overnight treatment. Come morning, you won’t be able to get over just how baby-soft and smooth your hands are. 7. A fresh mani helps too! It’s all about presentation. Keep your nails simple or as extravagant as you’d like, but chip-free is key. . . .

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by admin"],"url":"https://blog.mariobadescu.com/fall-is-here-hooray/","Text":["My favorite time of year is right around the corner. Late September through March. I love the cool and cold weather. I love my fuzzy sweaters and boots. I love that my apartment is normal room temperature and not 90 degrees like all Spring and Summer. I love walking for miles and miles in the city, people watching and window shopping without breaking a sweat. I love having a cup of hot coffee without feeling like I’m having a hot flash after the first sip. By late September I am really missing my hot chocolate (with Bailey’s of course). Strange but I love when it gets dark early. Aside from severely limiting the time I can go running outside after work if at all, I am a big fan of dim and dark. Probably stemming from many years of being self-conscious of my skin. Not anymore –thank you Acne Facial Cleanser and Whitening Mask ! Most of all I love my Orange Protective Cream and Walnut Body Lotion which I can only use in the winter. Fall makes me feel alive and revitalized after a long, hot summer of hiding inside except of course when I spent every day off at the beach or napping under the fan. That first¬ day of school smell is in the air in September and it brings back great memories of rattling metal lunchboxes, white tights and patent leather Mary Janes. Memories of piling on the blue mascara and black eye liner the second we got to the bus stop (no, not in the same years I was wearing white tights and Mary Janes and carrying a lunchbox! Well, not too much after…). Cooler weather makes me want to break out all the make-up that has been away for the summer like the rich colored lipsticks and eye shadows that seem too heavy and inappropriate for summer. I love all my rich body oils and lotions that would feel so awful to use in the horrible heat and humidity of July and August. I’m such a girly girl product junkie and summer just isn’t the time for product excess or any kind. Bring it on Fall! The smell of Fall in the air makes me want to make soup and muffins and I have already begun. I know my friends and co-workers will be happy about that. In a few months I’ll be stocking up my freezer with Thanksgiving leftovers that let me have yummy holiday dinners for weeks after. Having said that, the cooler weather gives me one less excuse not to work out regularly. No complaining about the heat and humidity. I just can’t think of anything I don’t like about the Fall season. The weather is perfect. The smells in the air make me think of happy memories and things I love to do, love to eat, love to wear. I’m just a happier person until July!

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Kimberly Yang"],"url":"https://blog.mariobadescu.com/mb-recipes-the-friday-night-treat/","Text":["T G I F ! The acronym says it all. There’s nothing more satisfying (and equally torturous) than waking up with knowledge that it’s Friday (TGIF!) only to realize that there’s still the remainder of Friday before it’s actually the weekend. Trust. We know the feeling all too well – counting down the hours, minutes, seconds before clocking out, heading home, doing last minute chores and finally relaxing. While we’ve produced skin miracles (our customers’ words!), we haven’t the ability to make Fridays whiz by. If we could, we would have done that a looong time ago. However, we do have little tips and tricks for making those last 9 – 5 hours worth it. Yes, really. Patience is a virtue, forget instant gratification, and let the wait be the reward itself. Set aside at least one hour to yourself every Friday night . Disconnect from the rest of the world (no phones, no internet, nothing!). Wind down. (no really, part ways with your computer/laptop/cell phone/etc.!). Whether you decide to stay in or head out, start your Friday nights right by treating your skin for a bit of at-home TLC. After all, there’s nothing like a refreshing cleanse, scrub and mask to rid ourselves of the workweek’s stress and start the weekend anew. Our favorite little recipe for quick fix? Though the following products recommended are great for most skin types, please keep your individual skin type in mind! You Will Need: 8 oz. Enzyme Cleansing Gel 4 oz. Almond & Honey Face Scrub 2 oz. Orange Tonic Mask wash cloth a good book or magazine cucumber slices (optional) The How-To: 1. Squeeze a dime to nickel sized amount of the Enzyme Cleansing Gel into the palm of your hand and massage it onto your face. Work it into the skin in circular motions, letting it remove a day’s worth of makeup, dirt and oil while Papaya and Grapefruit extracts gently exfoliate. Rinse thoroughly with lukewarm water and pat your face dry with a clean wash cloth. Ahh. Already you should feel a bit more refreshed! 2. Scoop a bit of this delectable (smelling) blend and massage the Almond & Honey Scrub onto your face for a minute or so. Relaxation calls for a silky, non-abrasive exfoliant that helps reveal softer, smoother, supple skin. Rinse thoroughly and pat dry. 3. Refresh and purify. Apply a thin layer of the Orange Tonic Mask (another delicious fragrant to woo your senses) over your entire face – avoiding the eyes – and down onto your neck and chest. For the next 15-20 minutes, feel it rejuvenate, tighten and clarify. Read a magazine, start a new book, or lie down with cucumber slices over your eyes. Relax. 4. Once the mask has fully dried, cleanse your skin thoroughly. Pat dry. Serves one. Double, triple, quadruple the ingredients for a girl’s night! Tell me you don’t feel much better already. . . . What would be your ultimate Friday night combo? Let us know in the comments below! Not sure if these products will work for you? Leave a comment with your skin type and we will make recommendations; it’s all about swapping, mixing and matching products for specific skin types.

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Subtitle":["summer skin tips quay sunglasses"],"Title":["Top 10 Tips for Glowing Summer Skin"],"url":"https://blog.mariobadescu.com/10-summer-skin-tips/","Text":["Summer skin is in. 1. Always apply sunscreen . Sun protection is crucial to skin health—in fact, it’s one of the most surefire ways to prevent premature signs of aging (like fine lines, wrinkles, and sagging) and discoloration (like age spots and darkening of post-acne marks). Be sure to apply first thing every morning or 20 minutes prior to any outdoor activities; re-apply every hour to ensure your skin stays protected throughout the day, especially if you’re going to be spending time during the sun’s peak hours (11 a.m. to 3 p.m.). For combination/oily, oily, or acne-prone skin skin: Oil Free Moisturizer SPF 30 For combination/dry skin: Collagen Moisturizer SPF 15 For dry or mature skin: The Moisture Magnet SPF 15 2. Don’t forget to protect your hands and feet. Yes, driving and walking around in open-toed shoes makes you susceptible to sun damage and premature signs of aging. Be sure to exfoliate, moisturize, and protect exposed hands and feet. Our tip? Keep a bottle of Oil Free Moisturizer SPF 30 on hand when you’re out and about. It’ll not only keep your hands and feet hydrated, but will also sink in quickly without feeling greasy—all while protecting your skin. 3. Exfoliate regularly . It’s essential to glowing skin : By removing pore-clogging surface impurities and dulling dead skin cells from the skin, exfoliation helps diminish discoloration and prevent future breakouts. The Glycolic Foaming Cleanser has been a total game-changer for most of us at MB HQ—but if you prefer a granular exfoliant, give our invigorating Botanical Exfoliating Scrub instead. 4. Moisture matters . Summer sun, heat, salt water, chlorine, and air conditioning can wreak havoc on skin. To help keep skin hydrated and healthy-looking, moisturize with SPF before sun, and use a night cream before bed. And for glowing, silky-smooth skin from head to toe, be sure to moisturize your hands and body too. 5. Don’t skimp on eye cream . Sun exposure will gradually thin skin and cause wrinkles, so it’s essential to make eye care a priority. Try using a lightweight formula for day, and a creamier version overnight so you wake up with plumper, younger-looking under-eyes. Throw on a baseball cap or large, floppy beach hat to help further shield your face, neck, and chest from dangerous UVA/UVB rays. 6. Look for alpha/beta hydroxy acids in your skincare* . Even if you’re already exfoliating, your skin can always use a boost in further brightening and smoothing the complexion. Ingredients like Grapefruit Extract , Papaya Extract , Lactic Acid , Glycolic Acid , and Salicylic Acid help take your daily regimen to the next level. *Broad spectrum protection is more important than ever if you’re using AHAs and BHAs. Because these ingredients are constantly encouraging the removal of dead skin cells to reveal fresher, newer skin, sunscreen is crucial in keep skin looking even. 7. Vitamin C is key. Specifically, a Vitamin C Serum . 8. Detox . Use a purifying mask 2-3 times a week to deep clean skin, absorb excess T-zone shine, and reveal a refreshed, healthy-looking complexion. 9. Keep hydrated . Drink water throughout the day. If you’re on the go, bring a water bottle and container of fresh fruit to prevent dehydration. 10. Make the healthy switch . As tempting as it is to lie in a tanning bed (guilty!) or sunbathe (guilty again!), make the switch to self-tanners to achieve that ever-covetable summer skin without yielding yourself to the dangers of overexposure. Beauty Tip: Our faces will always be a shade or two lighter than our body; to build color on your face as well, alternate between a tinted moisturizer and facial self-tanner to achieve an even wash of sun-kissed color. . . .

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Nicole Darmanin"],"url":"https://blog.mariobadescu.com/mario_badescu_facial_4_24_17/","Text":["Planning a trip to Visit the Mario Badescu Facial Salon in NYC? Here’s what to expect! Plus: FAQs, tips, and a few anecdotes about the Mario Badescu Facial and the salon that has been the heart of the brand for 50 years! What exactly is a “Mario Badescu Facial”? The classic European Facial at the Mario Badescu Skin Care Salon consists of a steam, deep pore cleansing (aka extractions), and hand selection of treatments chosen for your skin type. What kind of facial should I book? Our goal is to make sure that your facial addresses your individual needs. Because of this, we strongly suggest that everyone book the standard “European Facial”. This appointment will allow time for any special treatments that you would like to add on. While we know that the Gold Mask sounds amazing, it may not be what your skin needs right now. This is why we suggest selecting any add-on treatments after your aesthetician has the chance to evaluate your skin and make suggestions. Will my visit to the Mario Badescu Spa be a Zen-like experience? Yes and no. This is a tricky question. I’ve first-hand had hundreds of barely coherent conversations with post-facial clients who are sleepily floating their way out of our doors after their Mario Badescu facial. Even more guests have told me that they’ve fallen asleep during their treatments. However (insert record scratch), there are a few things to consider. Our number one priority is to help your skin look its very best. There are many spas where the main goal is to help you relax. I really like those places. Those places are lovely. I even visit them myself. . .when I need to relax. When my skin is rebelling, the Mario Badescu Salon is the only place I go. Why might a Mario Badescu facial not feel very Zen-like? Firstly, extractions pinch. Secondly, our bustling salon has been a skin care institution on Manhattan’s East Side for 50 years. That’s five decades of solid problem-solving skin care. And five decades of growth, in a residential building, in New York City–do you see where I’m going here? We’ve grown into every available square foot and currently have 37 treatment rooms. In fact, when we are completely booked we accommodate over 150 facials a day! That’s a lot of clients (not to mention aestheticians, skin specialists, managers, and housekeeping staff) coming in and out of our door. There are some days when we are positively BUZZING and the activity is palpable. I absolutely love the energy and seeing all of our amazing clients (many of whom we know by name, hi guys!), but at those moments I probably wouldn’t describe the atmosphere as perfectly peaceful. Who is your best aesthetician? There isn’t one. Not what you wanted to hear? I know, but hear me out. The salon has many aestheticians on staff and each and every one of them has their own loyal following who thinks she is the best. If you happen to have a friend who is a regular client at the salon, we suggest asking for a recommendation from them. Since they know your personality, they may be able to do a great job playing matchmaker! How often should I have a Mario Badescu facial? The general advice we give is to come in every 4-6 weeks. However, if you are working one-on-one with an aesthetician, they may customize a different plan for you. How far in advance do I have to book my appointment ? For weekend or evening appointments, I suggest calling two weeks in advance for the most options. This doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t give us a try if you need an appointment with less notice; you’ll just have the best chance of getting the exact appointment time that you are hoping for if you book further out. For daytime appointments during the week, you can usually snag an appointment same-day. Where exactly is the salon? The Mario Badescu Skin Care Salon is housed on the ground level of a residential building on Manhattan’s East Side. The address is 320 East 52nd Street between 1st and 2nd Avenues. The salon is tucked away with our only signage being a plaque on the left side of the building’s entrance. Once you enter the building, there is a doorman who can point you in the right direction. No facial? No worries! You don’t have to be booked for a facial to come visit Mario Badescu’s flagship location. We have lots of customers who come to shop for products and get our in-house staff’s expert product recommendations. Fun fact: This is the only place that carries the entire Mario Badescu Skin Care line . So, please visit, don’t be shy. We’d love to meet you!

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Sara Kosmyna"],"url":"https://blog.mariobadescu.com/skin-type-3/","Text":["Assessing your skin type is necessary for creating an effective skin care regimen. It’s important to know where you fall in the spectrum of possibilities because skincare products are specifically designed to work for certain skin types. In particular, the entire Mario Badescu Skin Care line is designed so that every individual can use a totally customized regimen for their particular skin. The following classification can be used as a quick reference. Once you know what to look for, determining complexion type is easy. The list below includes characteristics of the five major skin types. Scroll to the bottom for a link to our online skin type quiz. Oily Shiny, slick, often thick skin. Absorbs powder readily and begs for more. Large pores on the T-zone (forehead, nose and cheeks). Oil-based moisturizers are not absorbed by the skin. Dry: Dull, thin and flaky skin. Quickly becomes chapped and parched. Soaks up moisture and thirsts for more. Pores may appear virtually invisible. Fine lines and wrinkles are more apparent. Combination: Combination is skin is characterized as either combination-oily or combination-dry. Having otherwise normal skin with an oily t-zone is characteristic of combo-oily skin. Normal skin that sometimes experiences dryness is indicative of combo-dry skin. Normal: Skin is naturally moisturized without looking too dry or oily. Does not require additional oil control or hydration throughout the day. Pores do not appear to be overly large or extremely small. Remember to take a skin type test if you’re still unsure of how you fall into these categories. We believe in making skincare easy and effective, so we’ve created an online skin type quiz to determine your complexion type and make sure your skin is classified properly. It’s important to know how your skin functions to determine what’s best for it. If you’ve been using products that aren’t formulated for your skin’s needs, you could fall under the assumption that you have bad skin; however, once you begin a routine with the right products, the transformation may make you feel like you have been blessed with brand new skin!

This busy lady and her team spread #MBSkinTips around the Chicago area and beyond. We asked her which MB products are at the top of her list, keep reading for Lauren’s must-haves! Lauren’s Favorites Skin Type I have classic Combination Skin. I am oily through the T-zone and dehydrated through the cheeks. I also live in Chicago where the sun shines really bright, but the winter winds can dehydrate my skin even more!! And lastly, my skin is prone to acne, and that can leave discoloration and unwanted texture. Yikes!! Lauren’s 5 Glycolic Foaming Cleanser : This foaming cleanser is the perfect way to gently improve uneven texture and tone. It effectively exfoliates and cleanses my skin while helping to address any small blemishes on my face without overdrying my skin. Alpha Grapefruit Cleansing Lotion : This toner gently exfoliates my skin, and helps to reveal a more radiant, glowing, lit-from-within skin. It smells amazing and because it is alcohol-free, it aids in replenishing hydration. Cellufirm Drops : I use this heavenly product as my daytime serum. Cellufirm Drops immediately hydrates and visibly plumps my skin. I notice increased firmness in my skin, as well as a really smooth texture. This product also does double-duty for me as an under eye serum layered underneath Hyaluronic Eye Cream . Honey Moisturizer : This daytime moisturizer is the perfect amount of moisture for my Combination/dehydrated skin. It absorbs into my skin rapidly, while creating a smoother more radiant complexion. I love a slight glow to my skin before I apply foundation, and Honey Moisturizer creates the perfect canvas for my makeup. For the cold, dry Chicago winters, I like to add a few drops of the Herbal Hydrating Serum . It allows me to boost the hydration level in my skin care, when needed, without switching moisturizers. #MBSkinTip: When I know the weather is going to be especially harsh, I like to press a little bit of a denser moisturizer or night cream into my cheeks, after I have applied my typical skincare regimen. Silver Powder : Because I wear foundation daily, and have an oily t-zone, I am prone to blackheads on my nose and chin area. I use Silver Powder to address this issue. It immediately starts to break down the congestion and the clogged pores and after 10-20 minutes my nose and chin are clear of all blackheads. Silver Powder is a twice weekly staple product for me.

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Kimberly Yang"],"url":"https://blog.mariobadescu.com/ultimate-glowing-skin-regimen-every-skin-type/","Text":["Stop, drop, and glow. True, glowing skin is still having its moment—but trend or not, we can’t get enough. Radiant, healthy-looking skin is the ultimate goal here at Mario Badescu, and here’s how we’re going to help you achieve it, no matter your skin type. Behold, the ultimate glowing skin regimen for every skin type: HOW TO GET GLOWING SKIN IF YOU HAVE… Start with clean skin (if you’re not sure which cleanser you should be using, find your perfect face wash here .) Then… DRY SKIN Exfoliate . For a bright, smooth base—scrub regularly. Almond & Honey Face Scrub is a decadent treat that gently buffs away dulling dead skin cells while infusing nourishing oils into your skin. Liberally mist clean skin with our rose Facial Spray to prep and hydrate your complexion. Smooth . Apply 3-4 drops of Cellufirm Drops all over to give your skin a smoother, plumper finish. Is it daytime? Go for The Moisture Magnet SPF 15 , a creamy formula beloved by makeup artists for its ability to deeply nourish and soften skin. Heading out in the evening? Use Honey Moisturizer . Going to bed? Layer Vitamin C Serum under your favorite night cream. Customize your glow . Totally optional, but worth the extra step. Apply a few drops of Rose Hips Nourishing Oil wherever your skin craves an extra moisture boost—like your cheeks or around the nose. This lightweight facial oil is formulated with Rosehip, an extract packed with antioxidant Vitamin C, to give skin a brighter appearance and smooth the appearance of dry, flaky skin. Mist and repeat . Mist now, then mist again after makeup to give your final look a radiant finish. OILY SKIN Renew . Keep your complexion in tip-top shape by replacing your regular face wash with Glycolic Foaming Cleanser two to three times a week. Purify . Eliminate excess oil and decongest your complexion. Silver Powder works to draw out all that pore-clogging impurities and blackheads—leaving your skin refreshed, radiant, and re-balanced. Follow with toner. Mist . Start with a few spritzes of Facial Spray with Aloe, Cucumber and Green Tea to wake up and tone your complexion. We recommend sticking your bottle in the fridge to give your skin an instant wake-me-up, de-puffing boost. Moisturize . Oily skin needs hydration too—which is why when it’s dehydrated, oil glands go into high gear to overcompensate, leaving skin looking greasy and prone to congestion or breakouts. This is where a lightweight, moisturizer comes into play to re-balance skin. Try Oil Free Moisturizer SPF 30 for day ( Oil Free Moisturizer as a non-SPF alternative). Headed to bed? Apply Seaweed Night Cream at night so you wake up with radiant skin. Mist again . Rose-infused or Green Tea —the choice is yours. ACNE-PRONE SKIN Renew . Keep your complexion in tip-top shape by replacing your regular face wash with Glycolic Foaming Cleanse r two to three times a week. You’ll want to avoid a granular exfoliant if you’re broken out to avoid exacerbating or tearing at existing breakouts. Mask . Maintaining balance is key in keeping skin looking healthy, clear, and radiant—so as diligent as you are about using your Drying Mask , you want to make sure you’re restoring hydration to the skin by using Healing & Soothing Mask on alternate days. Mist . Facial Spray with Aloe, Cucumber and Green Tea not only tones skin, but gives it a cooling, soothing boost too—which is exactly what troubled skin craves. Moisturize . Again, balance is crucial. Keep skin hydrated with Aloe Moisturizer SPF 15 or Oil Free Moisturizer . At night, use Anti Acne Serum : it provides lightweight hydration while giving breakouts the botanical boot, thanks to its Salicylic Acid and Thyme formula. Powder . A light dusting will combat unwanted shine to encourage a healthy glow! Apply Special Healing Powder to the T-zone to remove excess oil and help decongest skin. Mist . Totally optional, but highly recommended. \uD83D\uDE42 COMBINATION SKIN Polish . Starting with smooth, even-toned base is key in getting your glow on, so make a habit of gently exfoliating with Botanical Exfoliating Scrub one to three times a week. Mist . Rose or Green Tea ? Take your pick. Evenly mist your complexion to give your skin a hydrating boost before you apply your moisturizer. Hydrate . Try Oil Free Moisturizer SPF 30 or Hydro Moisturizer with Vitamin C for day. Moisturizing at night? Layer Vitamin C Serum under Seaweed Night Cream . Customize your glow . Add a few drops of Herbal Hydrating Serum all over, or apply it in targeted areas where you need a boost in hydration and radiance (like between the brows, around the nose, and on the cheeks). And of course, mist once more. Related posts: Glowing Skin Made Easy Seriously. It’s as easy as 1-2-3. Beauty trends come and go—but here at Mario Badescu Skin Care, glowing skin is...

Where does one find such a group? Well, I didn’t have to go far. I get to work with them every day. Mom must-haves! Happy Mother’s Day, everyone! When it comes to moms, I will forever feel like I won some kind of life-lottery simply by being born to my smart, resourceful, boundlessly kind, and wickedly funny mother. And if you take into account the group of talented, hardworking moms (and one mom-to-be!) who I get to work with here at Mario Badescu, I’ve pretty much struck gold twice! Here are their favorites: Raimey Van Nostrand, Creative Director Mom to: Emily, 11 & Henry, 9 “I love taking a little time out for a mask after a long, hectic day. Whether I am multi-masking with Enzyme Revitalizing Mask and Drying Mask or I have a full face of Whitening Mask on (smells so good!), that 10 minutes of me-time is wonderful.” Raimey’s mask trio Kelly Timov, National Sales Director Mom to: Milana, 15 months “My favorite Mario go-to has to be the Glycolic Eye Cream . I use it every night to help my tired eyes look bright and hydrated. No one would know I’ve only slept 5 hours!” Kelly’s non-negotiable eye cream Marci Teran, Wholesale Account Director Mom to: Skyler, 20 “My all day, everyday go-to is the Facial Spray with Aloe, Herbs and Rosewater . It’s a great pick-me-up throughout the day when feeling sluggish and a great way to set makeup. Now if only my 20-year-old would keep her hands off my bottle!!” Danielle Kulick, Regulatory Specialist Mom to: Devyn, 7 & Dylan, 3 “As a busy mom on-the-go, I want to look fresh and bright, despite how tired or worn down I actually feel. I ALWAYS have Facial Spray with Aloe, Herbs and Rosewater in my bag for the pick me up I so often need. I treat myself to Vitamin C Serum several times a week to keep my skin bright and glowing.” Melissa Hegazy, Digital Advertising Mom-to-be to: “I have not picked out names just yet, but I’m expecting a little boy and girl to make their debut in August 2016.” “I love the Oil Free Moisturizer SPF 30 . I use it religiously because my skin is now more sensitive to the sun and I want to prevent any sun damage. It doesn’t make me break out or clog my pores and best of all it doesn’t leave my skin greasy like many moisturizers with SPF do. It gives me the perfect amount of moisture I need all day along with the protection I need. I love it!” Mickey Dias, National Field Director Mom to: Livy, 2 & Rui, 5 months “ Cellufirm Drops are my absolute cannot-live-with-out product! This little green baby is a must have for all mamas. They give me that firm, healthy, ‘kids sleep through the night’ look to my skin ;)” Related posts: Do You LOVE Mario Badescu Skin Care? Win MB Products On INSTAGRAM!

In fact, it’s pretty awesome. For many of us, these years are when it finally feels like we’ve grown into ourselves and are far more stable and content than in our teens and 20s. As the years go by, however, your skin may present a bit of a challenge. The good news? With thoughtful product selection, your anti aging skin care regimen can really make a difference. I recently visited our Skin Care Salon in Manhattan, and let me tell you: the ladies who work there look amazing. Like, ten-years-younger sort of amazing. The secret to their youthful skin is dedication to their anti aging skin care regimens (and not cosmetic surgery). Aging is caused by two factors: Intrinsic Aging is part of the natural process of life that occurs when collagen and elastic production slow down and a host of other factors change the skin’s appearance. Extrinsic Aging is the term we use for all of the bad things— tanning , smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, etc.—that accelerate and exacerbate the normal aging process. Which extrinsic factors can you eliminate? This week, would you consider changing your everyday anti aging skin care routine to include sunscreen or additional sun protection? Can we re-think our attitudes about ‘healthy tans’ (there’s no such thing) and start doing the right thing for our skin? Let us know what changes you’re planning on making!

Since 2007, Anne and her co-blogger Hope have brightened up the web with their blog covering all things travel and beauty. We had a chance to sit down with Anne to talk skin care and her Mario Badescu favorites. 1. How would you describe your skin type? Ever changing. Just when I think I have it figured out, it throws me a curve ball. I tend towards dry, but that doesn’t mean I won’t get the occasional breakout, even though I’m 30 plus! 2. What is the best skin care advice anyone ever gave you? In your 30s, you’ll have the skin you deserve. When you’re younger, you can maybe get away with eating junk food, not wearing sunscreen and not washing your face, but once you hit that 3-0 milestone, if you haven’t been–or don’t start–taking care of your face, it shows! 3. In your opinion, what is the single most important thing you can do for your skin? Eat plenty or fruits and veggies, healthy fats like olive oil and walnuts and drink plenty of water. What you put in your body will show on your face. 4. What is your personal skin care routine like? I wash with Mario Badescu Cream Soap , morning and night. In the morning, I use a Vitamin C lotion, followed by a moisturizer with SPF. At night, I use a Retinoid cream every third day. I love Mario Badescu flight cream on the days I need a moisturizing oomph. 5. What is your first skin care memory? My mom encouraged me to start getting facials when I was in my early teens. I went to an old school European Aesthetician who gave me a classic facial with steam, extractions, scrubs and a masks–kinda like a Mario Badescu facial. I’ve been hooked ever since! . . .

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Lee Ann"],"url":"https://blog.mariobadescu.com/teenage-acne/","Text":["Being a teenager can be tough- we know all about it. Taking proper care of your skin can help reduce teenage acne breakouts and give you a healthy glow. 10 Skin Care Tips for Teens 1. A product that works well for your friends and/or sister, brother, cousin, etc. may not be right for your skin. Be sure to choose products according to what your skin needs. Cleanser for Oily Skin 2. Never use bar soap on your face. It is way too harsh and drying. If your skin is oily, there are specific cleansers designed to help cut down on grease and shine. 3. Use a moisturizer with SPF every single day , even if you’re spending most of the day sitting in class. Someday, in the not-too-distant future, your skin will thank you! Exposure to the sun is the number one cause of aging skin, including wrinkles and areas of skin discoloration. 4. Avoid the tanning salon… and cover up with sun block at the beach or pool. Tanning is the fastest way to age your skin and ultimately causes acne . 5. Your skin repairs itself while you sleep, so be sure you’re getting enough shut-eye. 6. Avoid picking at skin or ‘popping’ acne blemishes. Doing so spreads bacteria and causes further acne breakouts AND can cause permanent scarring on the skin. (Read: Teenage Acne and Self-Confidence ) 7. Drink lots of water. 8. Talk to your doctor about the right nutrition for you. Beautiful, glowing skin is often a reflection of the foods you eat. 9. Never sleep in your makeup, which can clog your pores while you sleep and cause breakouts. Getting into the habit of always washing your face at night is one that will pay off big time in the future as well: your makeup holds onto free radicals from the environment, which can damage your skin and cause aging. (Read: One of the worst things you can do to your skin- and your health ) Exfoliate with Glycolic Acid 10. Understanding a basic skin care regimen can make life so much easier (and your skin so much better cared-for!). It works like this: Cleanse, tone, and moisturize twice a day. In the morning, use a moisturizer with sun protection; at night, use a moisturizer without sun protection. Exfoliate using a scrub OR a chemical exfoliant (such as Glycolic Acid) two or three times a week. If your skin is very sensitive, only exfoliate once (maybe twice) each week. Apply a mask after cleansing (but before toning) twice a week. *** Sample Skin Care Routine for Teens Morning Routine Cleanse with our Enzyme Cleansing Gel , followed by toning with our Seaweed Cleansing Lotion on face and neck. Finally, apply our Oil-Free Moisturizer SPF 17 . Night Routine Cleanse with our Enzyme Cleansing Gel, followed by toning with our Seaweed Cleansing Lotion on face and neck. Then apply our Oil-Free Moisturizer ( without SPF). If you struggle with acne, simply swap the cleanser and toner for our Acne Facial Cleanser and Special Cucumber Lotion , and spot treat whiteheads with our Drying Lotion , spot treat cystic acne with our Buffering Lotion , and spot treat blackheads once or twice a week with our Silver Powder (at nighttime). Extras Once a week, apply our Flower and Tonic Mask . If you have acne-prone skin, apply our Drying Mask once a week. Related posts: Anatomy Of A Skin Care Regimen Okay, class.

Self-love, people—let’s make it a thing in February. Find me-time. #Treatyourself. Indulge in self-care—not just because you deserve to, but because it’s paramount to happiness. The all-pink theme has little to do with Valentine’s Day—it’s purely coincidental, we swear—and more to do with how obsessed we are with all things with rose extract, rose hips, and strawberry extract. They’re ingredients that not only feel indulgent, but actually are when it comes to skin care: this is an assortment of good stuff that helps soothe, nourish, and brighten to help you feel your very best. Even in the dead of winter. Here are the February skincare essentials we have on rotation: Facial Spray with Aloe, Herbs and Rosewater . This one is a no-brainer, tbh. But if you’re out of the loop, we’ll fill you in: this is a cold weather lifesaver when it comes to infusing skin with an extra boost of hydration. Dry, cracked skin is a thing of 2015. Where there’s dehydration, there’s rehydration: all thanks to this rose-and-aloe-infused mist. Rose Hips Nourishing Oil . Another winter fave for saving dry skin. Got flaky skin or cracked foundation around your nose, the corners of your mouth, and between the brows? Reach for this oil and say no more. The tiniest dab does the trick in imparting essential moisture and reviving skin back to its happy, balanced state. Plus, it’s got Rose Hips Oil —a natural source of antioxidant and skin-brightening Vitamin C. ( Read more about this product ) Special Hand Cream with Vitamin E . Yep. It’s still a favorite. There is no surviving winter without this hand cream, no sir-ee . Cleansing Milk with Carnation & Rice Oil . It sounds as luxurious as it feels—especially after a day of battling harsh, winter winds. This milky tissue-off cleanser not only helps remove all traces of makeup, but also softens and nourishes your skin, too. It’s an ideal formula for dry or sensitive skin types. Chamomile Cleansing Lotion . You saw it in our January edit, and it’s back again. The Moisture Magnet SPF 15 . This one too. Snowfall can magnify the reach of UVA/UVB rays—making SPF protection (and moisture) all the more crucial during the heart of winter. Caviar Day Cream & Caviar Night Cream . In a line of over 200 products, it’s easy to keep reaching for best-selling faves. This little duo deserves the spotlight: though underrated, it’s a highly related performer. Both are thick, luxurious creams formulated with Caviar Extract (a revitalizing antioxidant rich in amino acids and nutrients). The day cream version also contains Elastin to give skin that extra bounce and plumpness, and the evening edition is fortified with Collagen and Cocoa Butter for additional overnight firming and moisturizing benefits. Olive Eye Cream . It’s a celeb-favorite for good reason: this rich, moisture-intensive eye cream helps deeply hydrate while softening the look of fine lines and wrinkles. Definitely a must-have overnight treatment for dry, sensitive, or mature skin. Strawberry Tonic Mask . Balance is paramount in maintaining healthy, radiant skin—which is why we’re aiming to mask twice a week . We need all the hydration we can get (hence why we’re keeping all our moisturizers and creams front and center this month), but our skin also needs a regular detox too. Though gentle, the Strawberry Tonic Mask helps to decongest pores and rid the skin of dulling buildup. . . . What are YOUR February go-tos?

As if the name wasn’t enough of a giveaway, it’s not summer without our Summer Shine Body Lotion . At least not here at Mario Badescu. We believe beauty shines from within. As for achieving that luminous, sun-kissed glow? Your skin might need just a little help for a boost of radiance. We won’t tell it was from a bottle – it was all you . It’s our secret to sun-kissed skin for glow in all the right places. Dab it on, rub it in. Your legs, your collarbones, your shoulders. Or everywhere. A little goes a long way – it’s shimmer for the sophisticate, because looking like a disco ball was so 80s. Don’t just take it from me, though. Back in May (time flies!) we participated in the blogger event at The Makeup Show NYC and gave the attending bloggers a bottle of our beloved Summer Shine Lotion. Here’s what they said: . . . “It smells really good though—like a slight hint of cocoa butter and almond. The formula is lightweight–it moisturizes well without feeling heavy which is a perfect combo for summer. And get this—yesterday I also got caught in a severe thunderstorm with crazy winds. I got drenched but even after that most of the lotion still remained and I didn’t get that funny moisturizer mixed with water feeling on my skin… The smell has me hooked though…” – Danielle of “ The Style & Beauty Doctor “ “I’m usually all about quality not quantity, but in this particular case, I can’t quite squeeze enough out of the bottle! … this lotion is a true summer essential making your skin super soft and smooth without clogging pores. Amen! The lotion is light enough for everyday use, but adds just the right amount of glam for special occasions.” – Julie & Lauren of “ Born & Bread “ “Beauty junkies beware….once you try one Mario Badescu product, there is no turning back. You will quickly become obsessed like me!! Some of my other favorites are the Vitamin C Serum , Seaweed Cleansing Lotion and Enzyme Cleansing Gel . The great thing about the products is the formulations AND the price…plus they have been around since the 60′s keeping skin pretty.” – Lianne Farbes of “ The Makeup Girl “ “This [must-have] light lotion goes on and adds a gentle touch of gleam and sparkle to your skin that is perfect for us tan and pale-complected girls.” – Kelly Gould of “ Gouldylox Reviews “ “It’s perfect for a nice highlight to warmer weather’s bare skin and also for doing some leg contour.” – The Beauty Alchemist “I always feel a little bit sexier when I add a little body shimmer around my decolette area, and my legs. But, during the daytime I don’t want to use anything too noticeable. Step in Mario Badescu’s Summer Shine Lotion. I love this stuff. It gives my skin a subtle gorgeous shimmer. Nothing too cray cray for the daytime. It’s really moisturizing too because it contains peanut oil, and it has a slight scent of coconut. Perfect for the daytime if you want to give your skin an extra vava voom factor. I wouldn’t use this during the night though, just because I like a lot of VAVAVoom in the evening. But during the day, this is what I’m grabbing.” – Milly of “ Beauty Logic “ But if you need to see it to believe it, beauty expert Jennifer Walsh names this little MB Star as one of her summertime body lotion picks in a BetterTV segment with Rhiannon Ally.

Here’s why I love the Herbal Hydrating Serum —and why you will too: It applies like a dream. Water-light in texture and fast-absorbing by nature, this oil-free gel delivers refreshing hydration instantly . If you’re impatient and veer on the shiny side like me, Herbal Hydrating Serum is an absolute must. It’s the ultimate skincare staple for any regimen, no matter your skin type. Wear it alone or layer it on top of your moisturizer for an added boost in hydration and glow. Oily skin types will love it for its super lightweight, non-pore-clogging formula, and drier skin types will adore it for the extra radiance it gives. It’s travel-friendly—insomuch that a bottle of this stuff permanently resides in my handbag. To help hydrate any dry patches (like between my brows) or revive spots where makeup tends to cake or collect (like around the nose and the mouth), I’ll tap a drop of this product where needed. It doesn’t just hydrate. It rejuvenates, too. Extracts of Ginseng and Ginkgo—both known for their invigorating properties—leaves tired, lackluster skin feeling refreshed. You know how constant hand-washing or office air conditioning leaves your hands looking all sorts of dry and tight? I’ll squeeze a pea-sized amount and massage it onto the driest points (namely the knuckles) to help replenish moisture and smooth the look of fine lines. . . .

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Subtitle":["september skincare back to school"],"Title":["The Monthly Edit: September Skincare Essentials"],"url":"https://blog.mariobadescu.com/september-skincare-essentials/","Text":["Welcome to #MarioMonthlyEdit, where you (yes, you) get a sneak peek at our current essentials. If you missed our last installment, check it out here . There are two types of people in this world: (1) Those who believe in the magic of the New Year, and (2) those who view September as the start of something new. Back-to-school may end after your mid- to late 20s, but for some of us (myself included) who can’t undo years of conditioning, it’s a sentiment that never dies. September is more than just finding the best deal on school supplies: it’s a time to start over. We spruce up our notebooks and reinvent our wardrobes to put our best face forward for the new season—why not do the same for your skin? The goal this month is to clear out the old and make room for the tried-and-true. Keep things simple by going back to the basics; this is not the time to be fussing around with new products. (If, however, you’re feeling adventurous, make sure you keep a bottle of Drying Lotion and Azulene Calming Mask on hand to get rid of problem spots and re-balance skin fast.) This is what’s on our back-to-school/September skin care roster: Enzyme Cleansing Gel . It’s the go-to face wash for all skin types. Whether you’re slightly dry, on the oily side, or smack-in-the-middle normal , our Enzyme Cleansing Gel is just what you need to help refresh and brighten skin. Fruit enzymes and exfoliating alpha hydroxy acids help rid the skin of dulling dead skin cells and pore-clogging oil—leaving your complexion feeling rejuvenated and ready to take on the world (or, your first day of school). Remember : no matter how stressful your school days get, never, never go to bed without washing your face! Aloe Vera Toner . When you’re under pressure at school and work, your skin might freak—so to help keep your complexion in check, we suggest using a super gentle toner like this one. As its name suggests, our Aloe Vera Toner features Aloe to lightly hydrate while delivering soothing benefits to the skin. Botanical Exfoliating Scrub . Revitalizing ingredients like Ginger, Ginkgo, Green Tea, and Coconut help invigorate lackluster skin and wake up tired skin. The star of the show, however, are the finely ground Ecuadorian Ivory Palm Seeds that gently buff away dead skin to reveal a brighter and more even-toned complexion. Oil Free Moisturizer SPF 30 . It’s creamy yet oil-free; hydrating, never greasy; and antioxidant-rich (thanks to its Green Tea content!). What more could you want from a moisturizer? Azulene Calming Mask . Specially formulated to help comfort skin, our Azulene Calming Mask is a must-have of makeup artists and aestheticians worldwide. Keep a jar in your medicine cabinet in case your complexion needs a soothing boost to de-stress and re-boot. Flower & Tonic Mask . Be sure to deep clean at least once a week, too. This gentle clay mask helps purify pores and draw out impurities without leaving your skin feeling dry or tight. For best results, exfoliate first! Drying Lotion . You never know when a pesky problem might pop up—and you and I both know they love to sneak up on us the night before a big day. Luckily for you, you’ve got your overnight solution right here. Buffering Lotion . For those large, under-the-surface bumps that never seem to go away, don’t fret (and definitely don’t try to poke, prod, or pop). Our Buffering Lotion features gentle ingredients that work to help clarify skin and reduce the size of existing blemishes—making it a must-have for troubled skin. . . .

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Subtitle":["mario badescu disney packing checklist things you should bring"],"Title":["Going to Disney? Here’s a Checklist of Things You Should Bring"],"url":"https://blog.mariobadescu.com/disney-checklist-things-you-should-bring/","Text":["If you haven’t been keeping up with us on Instagram stories , you should probably change that. Last month, we were whisked away for a company-wide retreat that quickly turned into a Disney World takeover. Need a mist? No problem. There’s a person in front of you and in back of you who’s armed with a Mario Badescu Facial Spray, ready to share a refreshing spritz with other weary waiters in line. And between takes of tossing the facial spray in the air (#doitforthegram) and strategizing on how to hit all the best rides with minimal wait time, here’s what we learned: You’re never too old for Disney World. The buddy system is applicable to adults, too. There is a sweet spot between under-prepared and over-packed that’ll make your day in Disney all the smoother. So, without further ado: a list of all the things we brought (or wish we remembered to bring) so you can have your perfect day in Disney: FACIAL SPRAY . Bring two bottles (one rosewater, one green tea if you’re so inclined) because come 3pm mid-day slam, adults and kids both will be fighting over who gets spritzed first. You will need the refresher every hour or so (sweaty theme parks and long lines will call for multiple misting sessions), and it’ll give the kids (or you, even!) something to play with while waiting for It’s A Small World . #MBSkinTip : Do as the pros do. Stash your facial sprays the hotel fridge before you take on Disney World. That extra cooling boost is everything. OIL FREE MOISTURIZER SPF 30 . The last thing you want to do is lug around a giant bag for 8+ hours. Not only is this sunscreen compact and travel-friendly, it’s universal—which means this one bottle will do the trick for the entire Disney crew (dry-skinned tot and oily teens both will love this formula). AFTER SUN COOLING GEL . Whether you’ve been a little lax with the sunscreen application or if you just want a cooling boost all-over, After Sun Cooling Gel is your go-to for an instant cooling, soothing boost. Skin that gets the most sun—like shoulders and arms—will find this to be a nice treat after walking in the sun all day long. LIP WAX . Chapped lips are no fun—especially in the sun. HYDRATING HAND CREAM . It sounds like a non-essential, but it’s not: Stay with me on this one. Between sun exposure, constant hand-washing, and frequent-hand sanitizing between rides and food stops, your hands will get uncomfortably dry. The solution? A lightweight, fast-absorbing hand cream that keeps hands happy and refreshed thanks to its Peppermint-infused formula. No greasy hand prints on rollercoaster bars found here. A PONCHO. Especially if you’re going to be in Orlando. POWER BANK OR SPARE BATTERY PACK . Between the Insta-stories, snaps, and Fast Pass ride bookings, you’ll need all the juice you can get. You need your phone to last you until the fireworks show. Need . SUNGLASSES, HAT, LIGHT JACKET . Do what you can to prevent painful sunburns and worse—future sun damage. A DISPOSABLE CAMERA . Kick it old-school and do it for the memories. (Plus, losing it on Space Mountain will bring a lot less heartbreak than finding out your Instax flew off mid-drop.) HAND SANITIZER . It’s a public space, people. Related posts: It’s Halloween! Happy Halloween!

Bold statement, I know, but I’m standing by it. The way I see it, moisturizer is pretty much the porridge of skin care—you know, like from Goldilocks? If a face cream is too rich it can cause blackheads and breakouts. If it is too lightweight, it will leave your skin feeling dehydrated and tight. To win a coveted spot in your medicine cabinet it has to be just right, doesn’t it? I can stick it out to the end of a bottle of cleanser that isn’t quite right until I try a new one. Heck, I’ll use pretty much any eye cream until I hit the bottom of the jar, but if I suspect that my face lotion has caused one single pimple . . .mmm, bye. Because of this, I’ve created this guide to help you navigate our assortment. Keep reading to find the one that is “just right” for your individual skin type: Very Dry Complex Moisturizer with Vitamin E SPF 20 : Everything that dry, delicate skin needs in one place. Creamy, comforting moisture, antioxidant Vitamin E, and sun protection make this classic formula a long-time favorite of our most loyal customers. Hydrating Moisturizer with Biocare & Hyaluronic Acid : For when you want the same cushiony formula as the Complex with Vitamin E without the sunscreen. Hyaluronic Acid adds moisture-binding muscle to help soften even the driest skin. Dry The Moisture Magnet SPF 15 : Dry skin? This is your go-to. This best-selling formula thoroughly hydrates without sitting heavily on the skin and shields you from the harmful rays of the sun. Cellufirm Moisturizer : Peptides, Collagen, and Vitamin E work to boost hydration levels . . .and your youthful appearance! Combo/Dry Hyaluronic Moisturizer SPF 15 : Hyaluronic Acid helps to hydrate dry areas and SPF 15 protects. Honey Moisturizer : This super-sweet, mid-weight formula sinks right in and uses Honey Extract to soften and hydrate. Combo/Normal Collagen Moisturizer SPF 15 : A favorite of the staff at Mario Badescu’s New York City Salon, this feel-good staple contains Cottonseed Oil to replenish any dry bits without adding too much moisture to areas that lean oily. Buttermilk Moisturizer : This classic was originally formulated by Mario Badescu himself, and is perfect for those who need replenishment but prefer the feeling of ultra-lightweight formulas. Lactic Acid helps up your glow factor. Combo/Oily Oil Free Moisturizer SPF 17 : This tried-and-true go-to never disappoints. If you have combo/oily skin, this is a must. A.H.A. & Ceramide Moisturizer : Keep it light and bright, literally. AHAs gently brighten while this lightweight formula imparts just the right amount of moisture to combo/oily skin types. #MBSkinTip: Not into ultra-rich night creams? Try A.H.A. & Ceramide, Honey, or Buttermilk as part of your PM regimen. Oily and Acne-Prone Oil Free Moisturizer SPF 30 : We love this 3-in-1 formula that combines reparative Green Tea, oil-free hydration, and broad spectrum sunscreen. Oil Free Moisturizer : The perfect boost to restore balance to oily and acne-prone skin. Very Oily/Acne-Prone (and everyone else) Herbal Hydrating Serum : Ok, this is technically a serum, but I’m including it in this post because it is my secret weapon for keeping my notoriously persnickety skin happy and hydrated. Herbal Hydrating Serum can be applied alone to the very oiliest skin types. It can also be used on any skin type in conjunction with any moisturizer. Herbal Hydrating Serum is a win for everyone.

While the food choices will likely change with age (vegan spinach dip, anyone?), a few things remain constant: there are beauty lessons to be found everywhere. Here are a few from some of our top girls night in picks! 1. Mean Girls The moral of this Tina Fey comedy? Avoid putting foot cream on your face like Regina George. Actually, we think it’s something about being true to yourself and accepting others. Also, make sure you’re using the right skin care products for your skin. Can you believe this movie is already 10 years old? (Read: What’s your skin type? ) 2. 10 Things I Hate About You Oh my, Joseph Gordon Levitt. In all his teen adorable-ness, you know he (and the half of the cast that were actually teenagers) had to have some Drying Lotion at his disposal. 3. Breakfast at Tiffany’s Holly Golightly has a bad habit of sleeping in her makeup and then simply ‘touching-up’ before heading out. Yet, Audrey Hepburn’s skin remains flawless throughout the film. Let’s try to ignore this serious breach in logic and indulge in a deep cleanse. (Read: 5 Skin are habits to break ) 4. Girls Just Want To Have Fun If you haven’t yet seen this Sarah Jessica Parker dance movie classic, I insist you watch it immediately. Here’s the breakdown: Nerdy school girl signs up for a dance competition… and her partner is the hot bad boy from the wrong side of the tracks (of course, he’s actually a sweetheart). And you know there’s a skin care lesson to be had here—check out SJP’s glowing teen skin and witness what exercise can do for your complexion! (Read: Exercise and your skin ) 5. Sixteen Candles When I was a teenager, my best girlfriend and I would always call each other when we discovered Sixteen Candles on television (this is, of course, long before the days of on-demand and streaming). We, too, hoped that Jake would show up—with his Porsche—to rescue us from our angsty teen lives. The lesson in Sixteen Candles ? We’ll say that it’s probably a bad idea to give a teenage boy your birth control pills (remember that scene!?). (Read: Does hormonal birth control help acne? ) 6. Sleepless In Seattle We couldn’t make this list without including Meg Ryan. And what’s more romantic than a love story that’s simply meant to be ? The moral of this story: being ‘sleepless’ is just bad for your skin! (Okay, we may have stretched this last one a little!)

Yep, there sure is. Even with a gold star skin care regimen and meticulous habits, the occasional skin problem might pop up. We’re not talking the type of conundrum that rocks your world. If your skin decides to take a dive off the deep end you may need to consult an aesthetician, retail skin specialist, or in some cases a dermatologist, but that’s not today’s topic of discussion. Today, we’re talking about the little changes that you may notice day-to-day. The kind of situations where your skin looks fantastic except for that one. little. thing. This is precisely when a hero product can swoop in and save the day. These are some of my favorite solutions for skin that has gone just slightly awry. Problem: bumps, breakouts, and clogged pores Solution: Acne Facial Cleanser Surprise! You don’t have to suffer from moderate or severe acne to benefit from this cleanser. If you are noticing small bumpy clogged pores or random minor breakouts, try adding Acne Facial Cleanser into the mix. You can use it daily or as a supplemental cleanser a few times a week to deep clean pores and ward off bumps. Problem: blackheads Solution: Silver Powder Blackheads may very well be the most annoying skin problem. One of the questions we get most often is, “My skin is doing great but how do I get rid of these blackheads?” If blackheads are a very persistent problem, check out this post for tips on how to adjust your regimen. If you are just starting to notice a few of them crop up out of nowhere, try working Silver Powder into your weekly regimen. Simply use a dampened cotton round to press a bit of this super absorbent loose powder onto problem areas to absorb the pore-clogging impurities that have planted themselves in your precious pores. Problem: dry, sensitive skin Solution: Cucumber Cream Soap People with dry skin tend to focus a lot on their moisturizers. This makes perfect sense since it is when you apply moisturizer to the skin that you feel the tight, uncomfortable feeling that comes with dry skin immediately subside. While we aren’t denying the importance of a rich, comforting cream, the way you cleanse dry skin is equally important. Cleansers that strip and further dehydrate parched skin will only throw off the skin’s balance even more than it already is. Try using a gentle cream-based cleanser like Cucumber Cream Soap to purify skin without depleting it. Problem: dehydrated skin with fine lines Solution: Cellufirm Drops Sometimes a subtle shift in your skin’s appearance can be a thorn in your side. That nagging little thing you notice every time you lean in close and look in the mirror. If you suddenly notice slight dullness accompanied by a new crop of fine lines, don’t panic. Reach for a bottle of Cellufirm Drops instead. This lightweight serum is packed with ingredients that bind moisture to (aka plump) the skin and fine lines along with it. Apply a thin layer to face and eye area before moisturizer day and night for best results. Problem: rough, dry hands Solution: Special Hand Cream with Vitamin E Hand cream for dry hands? Groundbreaking. I know, I know, but are you using it? At this very moment I am typing away in an office with a salon full of women with the softest, most beautiful hands I’ve ever seen one floor above me. Who are these women with hands as soft as kitten paws? Mario Badescu aestheticians, that’s who. Why are their hands so soft? Because they are constantly covered in anti-aging treatments, silky skin serums, and buttery creams rich in antioxidant oils and nourishing vitamins. Want your own set of kitten paws? Make sure to plant a hand cream next to every sink in your house, on your desk, in your car, and in your bag. Apply every single time you wash your hands (which should be often, it is still cold season, you know).

Generally speaking, pockmarks are best treated by a dermatologist using various techniques, including lasers, dermabrasion, chemical peels, and/or fillers.

DRYING LOTION Formulated in: 1960s Pink may be pretty—but it also targets whiteheads while you sleep. Drying Lotion was formulated by Mario Badescu himself—making it the original bi-phase solution that dries up surface blemishes overnight. Pink isn’t for every type of breakout, though. Use Buffering Lotion to help shrink large, under-the-skin bumps and Drying Cream for small bumps and pimples. FACIAL SPRAY WITH ALOE, HERBS AND ROSEWATER Formulated in: 1980s Looks pretty in #shelfies, looks even better on your face. Mist the cult-favorite facial spray whenever, wherever to rehydrate and add radiance to your skin. Pink not your thing? We have a Cucumber and Green Tea-infused Facial Spray , too! MAKE-UP REMOVER SOAP Formulated in: 1970s Soap may be in the name—but in reality, this is a creamy, comforting cleanser that helps dissolve away light makeup without leaving your skin feeling dry or right. (In fact, it’s formulated without the use of fragrance, surfactants, or oils, so it’s perfect for dry or sensitive skin.) THE MOISTURE MAGNET SPF 15 Formulated in: 1980s The Moisture Magnet SPF 15 is technically millennial, but seeing as it’s considered an OG millennial, this product is deserving of the spotlight, too. Creamy and nourishing, this daily moisturizer gives skin a soft, smooth finish—which is why it’s a makeup artist favorite for creating an even base. STRAWBERRY FACE SCRUB Formulated in: 1980s Also technically millennial, this delectable (and photogenic) scrub is a must for anyone looking to add a gentle exfoliant to their regimen. Real strawberry seeds are infused to buff and smooth so dull skin looks fresh, even, and bright. Related posts: SCRUB-A-DUB-DUB!

How on earth are you supposed to know which is the very best anti-aging moisturizer for your skin? Although we all inevitably experience aging, the process is intricately personal. At Mario Badescu Skin Care, we’re deeply dedicated to providing seriously customized skin care because it’s the only kind that works. Is your skin still oily and/or experiencing acne breakouts? It’s important to choose an oil-free moisturizer and—to avoid unnecessary sun-related aging—use one with an SPF during the day. At any stage in life, it’s imperative that you wear sunscreen if you’re using acne treatment products. The goal is to moisturize while preventing sun damage (wrinkles and hyperpigmentation). Do you have dry skin or has your skin gotten drier with age? An oil-based moisturizer is your best choice in order to prevent the evaporation of water from the skin. Oils are fantastic for sealing in moisture. But don’t limit yourself to any old moisturizer—get the lowdown on the various active ingredients in order to decide which is right for you. For example: Hyaluronic Acid is a substance found naturally in the body. The ability to retain water is Hyaluronic Acid’s main claim to fame. Unfortunately, levels of Hyaluronic Acid decrease as we get older. When used in skin care products, it’s perfect for locking in the skin’s natural moisture and preventing the loss of moisture inherent to the aging process. Try our Hydrating Moisturizer with Biocare and Hyaluronic Acid. Alpha-Hydroxy Acids such as Lactic Acid are perfect for exfoliation! ( Buttermilk Moisturizer ) Pentavitin is an effective moisture regulator; it provides serious moisture under even the driest conditions. (The Moisture Magnet with Pentavitin SPF 15 ) Topical Vitamin C protects the skin from sun-related damage, reduces inflammation, promotes the production of collagen, diminishes discoloration, and strengthens the skin’s ability to protect itself. ( Hydro Moisturizer with Vitamin C OR Vitamin C Serum , which can be worn alone or under a moisturizer) Collagen improves the skin’s appearance by preventing moisture loss, plumping up the skin, and smoothing out wrinkles.

However, if you exfoliate at night instead of the morning, you’ll make the most of your skin care routine. By sloughing off dead skin cells when you exfoliate, you’re helping to unclog your pores, thereby allowing products to absorb better into your skin. Our skin is in repair mode at night while we sleep and the products that are formulated to use at nighttime tend to be more potent or contain more nourishing, reparative properties. Therefore, exfoliating at night will enhance nighttime product penetration.

I’ve never really given this much thought until recently. In fact, if you would have asked me if I was high maintenance a week ago I would have immediately said no. A budgeting debacle led me to take a look at my personal expenses and (gasp!) I never realized how many of them are beauty, grooming, and fitness related. Living in New York City it’s difficult to place yourself on the maintenance scale. On one end of the spectrum, I know gorgeous girls who wash their faces, apply sunscreen, roll up their yoga mats and skip out of their apartments looking fresh faced and beautiful everyday. On the other, there are equally stunning ladies who take 2 hours to get ready and have a regular schedule of waxing, facial, spa, dermatologist, nail, hair and personal training along with occasional nip, tuck and injection appointments worked into their monthly calendar. Personally, I have great affinity for both the natural beauties and the perfectly primped, but where do I fit in? Hmmm, perhaps there is such a thing as being medium maintenance? These are the beauty related expenses that were on my list: Weekly Manicure Every other week Pedicure Eye brow grooming Monthly Waxing 2 gym memberships (paid for monthly) Every other month Facial (at Mario Badescu of course!)

Here’s How to Get Clear Skin"],"url":"https://blog.mariobadescu.com/back-to-school-clear-skin-solutions/","Text":["Or, maybe you’re not headed back to school. Perhaps you want a regimen refresh because the summer-to-fall weather transition is throwing your complexion for a loop. Whatever it is, troubled skin deserves a clear start. Here’s the definitive skin care guide for oily, acne-prone skin: MAKE SURE YOU’RE CLEANSING TWICE DAILY. Don’t underestimate the power of the right face wash. Acne Facial Cleanser is a must for congested or problem skin: Formulated with Salicylic Acid to deep-clean pores and break down the oil and dead skin cells known to cause breakouts, this daily cleanser leaves skin thoroughly cleansed—but never tight or dry. Did you know? Acne Facial Cleanser also contains Thyme Extract, which boasts clarifying properties that that give breakouts the (botanical!) boot. YES, TONER MATTERS . In fact, toner can be a game-changer—especially when you’re looking for that extra something to take your skin care regimen to the next level. Not only are Mario Badescu toners crucial for re-balancing skin post-cleanse, but are also specially formulated to deliver additional benefits in a single sweep. For oily, congested complexions, toning is the step that can truly make a difference in how your skin looks and feels. Special Cucumber Lotion is the standard go-to for troubled skin since it offers enhanced cleansing and a cooling, Cucumber boost. If, however, you’re experiencing severe breakouts, try Special Cleansing Lotion”C.” This is a powerful clarifying astringent formulated with Sulfur, Cucumber to target problem areas while removing pore-clogging oil and impurities from the skin. Body breakouts are normal, too—especially during and at the tail end of summer. After showering ( A.H.A. Botanical Body Soap is a favorite for keeping skin looking even and clear!), apply Special Cleansing Lotion “O” to your back and chest. Keep in mind that this is a strong formulation specially designed for use on those areas only, so bare mind that it’s not meant for use on the face. MASK LIKE YOU MEAN IT . Masks are a surefire way to help keep your complexion in tip-top condition and bring a little bit of instant gratification to your skin care regimen. Drying Mask is highly effective at working to clarify problem areas and dry up existing blemishes. To help rehydrate and restore balance to your skin, use Healing & Soothing Mask the day after. KNOW YOUR ON-THE-SPOT, CLEAR SKIN SOLUTIONS … …because picking the right one makes all the difference. One of our most frequently asked question is which spot treatment to use. You can read our full guide here , but here’s a quick overview: Whiteheads? Use Drying Lotion . Don’t shake the bottle: just dip a cotton swab straight down the bottle until you reach the pink sediment and apply directly on whiteheads. Small bumps and pimples? Try Drying Cream . Use clean fingers to blend the product onto erupted areas. Less is more with this one! Large, often painful, under-the-surface bumps? Use Buffering Lotion . This liquid-y solution is something you do shake! Shake the bottle until the white sediment is dissolved into the clear liquid, then apply a drop t a clean fingertip and gently pat onto the deep, painful blemish. Experiencing a combination of breakout types? No worries—grab our Acne Repair Kit , which includes all three of our spot treatments. Another great product to keep on hand in your skin care arsenal is Special Healing Powder . It’s a multi-purpose super powder that: Absorbs excess oil and fights unwanted shine Helps clarify congested or troubled skin Encourages a clearer, healthier complexion. Simply dust the powder directly on your skin (including your back and chest) where needed, or mix a small amount into your favorite loose powder to add a skin care element to your makeup. STILL NOT SURE WHERE TO START? Customizing your skin care regimen is key to finding the best mix of products that work well for your skin—but if you’re feeling a bit overwhelmed at this point, no worries. Start with the Acne Control Kit , then add more products as you figure out what your skin needs (and loves!) along the way. . . . Not acne-prone?

If you’re in want of collecting a jarful of sticky flies, by all means—but we do know one thing honey attracts for sure: moisture. Honey’s skincare benefits are plenty: this ingredient is full of natural antioxidants and is known to help boost moisture and radiance in depleted skin, which is why it’s been a favorite for those with dull or dehydrated complexions. Take Honey Moisturizer , for example, which was made to leave your skin soft, supple, and smooth. A lush blend of Honey and an antioxidant-rich oil protect against moisture loss and bring out the dewiness within. ( We heard through the grapevine that Kyle Jenner starts her mornings with this Mario Badescu moisturizer .) Another Honey-infused favorite: Almond & Honey Face Scrub , a delicious, creamy scrub that makes every exfoliating session a treat. A unique base of finely ground Almonds, Cornmeal, and Kaolin buffs away dulling surface impurities and dead skin cells as Honey and Sweet Almond Oil deeply nourish skin—making it the perfect scrub for dry or sensitive skin. Honey Extract is also a key ingredient in other radiance-boosting products: It’s found in Revitalin Moisturizer to help revitalize depleted skin, Glycolic Skin Renewal Complex to further unveil a brighter, more even-looking complexion, and Skin Renewal Complex to deeply moisturize and pamper skin.

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Kimberly Yang"],"url":"https://blog.mariobadescu.com/difference-between-drying-lotion-cream-buffering-lotion/","Text":["Congrats! You’ve come to the right place for fast-acting, clear skin solutions. But with not one, but three spot treatments in front of you, which of these Mario Badescu products will work best for your breakouts? Whiteheads ? Use Drying Lotion . Drying Lotion is the original, award-winning product that targets pimples while you sleep. It was formulated by Badescu himself in the 1960s and has since taken top shelf in medicine cabinets around the world. Here’s how Drying Lotion works: Whatever you do, don’t shake the bottle . It’s tempting—it’s the first thing most people do when they see it—but Drying Lotion is meant to work as a bi-phase solution. Dip a cotton swab into the pink sediment . Here’s a tip: use the smaller, fine-tipped cotton swabs for more precise application. It’ll grab less product too, which means your bottle will last you a little longer. Apply the product directly to whiteheads . Think of Drying Lotion as a tiny pink mask for every pimple. Leave it on overnight and wash everything off come morning. Voila! Small bumps and pimples ? Use Drying Cream . Drying Cream is specially formulated to target and dry up those clusters of small bumps and blemishes. After you’ve cleansed and toned your skin, pat a small amount of the cream on those breakouts. The powerful Sulfur and Zinc Oxide formula works to clarify troubled areas so skin appears smoother and clearer the next morning. Large and painful, under-the-skin bumps ? Use Buffering Lotion . These are the kind of bumps that hurt to the touch and feel deeply rooted in the skin. Because this type of breakout doesn’t come to a head, they require a little extra care. Enter Buffering Lotion, a unique solution to these blemishes. Unlike most spot treatments, Buffering Lotion isn’t a paste or gel-like product. Instead, it’s super thin and water-y in consistency, which enables it to sink quickly into the skin and target problems at the root—so don’t be alarmed when you first start using it! For starters, do shake the bottle: you want the white sediment to mix with the liquid so it turns milky-white in color. For every spot you see, squeeze one drop onto a clean fingertip and gently pat it onto the blemish. (Need all three solutions? Get our Acne Repair Kit and save.) …so what’s the Anti-Acne Serum ¸ you ask? Anti-Acne Serum isn’t a spot treatment. It’s a super lightweight gel that’s designed to re-balance skin and promote a clearer complexion. Here’s how: Salicylic Acid (a powerful beta hydroxy acid) helps rid the skin of pore-clogging sebum and dead skin cells—which when left to accumulate, leads to breakouts—and allows Thyme Extract to clarify pores. It’s easy to use too. Apply nightly on breakout and blackhead-prone areas to keep skin looking clear for the long-run. . . .

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Subtitle":["7 Things Every Dancer Needs (Plus, What’s In My Dance Bag?)"],"Title":["7 Things Every Dancer Needs (Plus, What’s In My Dance Bag?)"],"url":"https://blog.mariobadescu.com/7-things-every-dancer-needs-plus-whats-dance-bag/","Text":["Social media and copy director at Mario Badescu by day, salsa and bachata instructor/performer by night. These are the dance bag essentials that keep my skin calm, clear, and glowing on and off the dance floor: 1. DRYING LOTION Admittedly, I don’t keep a bottle of Drying Lotion in my dance bag ( it would be perpetually all shook up ), but it’s one of the non-negotiables in my post-rehearsal and post-performance skincare routine. Hours of sweating in the studio or caked in stage makeup can cause the occasional breakout, so if I feel a spot popping up, I’ll apply Drying Lotion before bed. Nip it in the bud, if you will—because this busy girl breaks (and breaks out) for no one. And if it’s good enough for Misty Copeland, it’s good enough for me . 2. FACIAL SPRAY WITH ALOE, HERBS AND ROSEWATER Let’s be honest: No what’s-in-my-bag would be complete without mention of this Mario Badescu classic. It’s a universal favorite without a doubt, but this multi-purpose mist is a dancer’s must-have for all the following reasons, and then some: It’s the perfect pick-me-up during the middle of a tough rehearsal. This mist freshens and rejuvenates your skin post-practice so you don’t leave the studio looking (or feeling) like a sweaty mess—you’ll just walk out looking perfectly dewy. Do spritz this everywhere—chest, décolletage, back of the neck, for that feel-good finish. Makeup for stage or nights out dancing tends to be heavy on skin, so I always spritz my foundation and concealer brushes (or the beauty blender, for those of you who are sponge-inclined) to make the application process easier. If my makeup still looks a little cake-y, I’ll do a fine mist over my face to ensure everything melts together for a flawless finish. To be clear, I do not condone this next tip for the sake of your suede-soled dance heels—but if you’re in a bind and need to add grip to your step, spritz the bottom of your shoes. You gotta do what you gotta do—and this trick has saved me from slipping on many a freshly waxed floor. 3. EYE MAKE-UP REMOVER CREAM I haven’t been without this makeup remover since Nicole (co-worker and fellow MB blogger!) put me on it. If you can, always always remove all your makeup prior to any sweat session to reduce chances of clogging your pores. I love this classic, gel-cream formula because it’s so easy to use. And here’s a little #MBSkinTip : I use this as an all-purpose balm. Elbows looking a little ashy before a shoot or heading on stage? The Eye Make-Up Remover Cream saves the day. Toes and heels looking cracked after a hard dance session in heels? Massage some of this skin protectant-like cream to moisturize and soften rough patches. 4. VITAMIN E BODY LOTION (WHEAT GERM) This classic, Mario Badescu formula is my go-to, period. But I do think it’s the best body lotion for dancers. Latin dancing (salsa and bachata for me, specifically) is largely based on partnerwork. You want your skin to be glowing and hydrated, but you can’t wear anything that leaves your skin slippery—which at best, becomes an annoyance to your partner, and at worst, a hazard when it comes to doing lifts and tricks. …which is why this has been my favorite body lotion for years. It’s incredibly nourishing but sinks in quickly sans greasy residue. Simply apply and resume practice. 5. SPECIAL HAND CREAM WITH VITAMIN E Same goes for this hand cream. It moisturizes without the post-application slip, meaning you and your partner can do all the crazy handwork without losing grip. #MBSkinTip : I use this hand cream on my feet, too. (Rebel, I know.) Though I can run, walk, dance in my heels, being perched on the balls of my feet for hours means they deserve a little TLC. Enter hand cream and spiked massage ball: After rehearsal, work away those knots before slipping into your street shoes. You won’t slip and slide, and you won’t leave a greasy footprint in the inner sole either. 6. SPECIAL HEALING POWDER This unique powder does exactly what its name purports—and then some. The sales director in me laments that this product flies under the radar in most markets, but the beauty junkie inside revels in just how much more special it is. But, as a millennial whose default is to over-share, I’ll let you in on this little secret of mine. Use it as directed, for starters. (I use this powder across my T-zone before dance classes to keep shine in check, and for intense practices, I’ll dust it across my chest and back to absorb shine and prevent congestion.) You can also do as the aestheticians at the Mario Badescu salon do—dust it across skin that’s just been shaven or waxed. Or, if you’ve “accidentally” popped a pimple because you couldn’t deal with a blemish the night before a huge show, dab this powder (using a clean cotton swab) over the erupted area and leave it while you sleep. Trust. 7. SUMMER SHINE BODY LOTION I could wax poetic about the Summer Shine Body Lotion , but I won’t. (Just kidding, I already did here along with a few others.) I live for this stuff. It smells delicious, it feels incredible, and it looks stunning on skin. The best part is, you don’t have to be a dancer to appreciate this lightweight, shimmer-infused lotion. (But if you are, this is a must for prepping your arms, legs, and décolletage prior to a shoot or show.) Use it on a night out. Use it during the day in summer. Actually—use it whenever, wherever you’re looking to get glowing with a hint of gold glimmer. Related posts: What’s In Your Bag? Skin Care On-the-Go We get it.

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Subtitle":["skin care mistakes"],"Title":["Stop! 10 Skin Care Mistakes You’re Making"],"url":"https://blog.mariobadescu.com/skin-care-mistakes/","Text":["Are you making these 10 skin care mistakes? 1. Being harsh on your skin . Cleansing too often or using cleansers or toners that are too harsh for your specific skin type (a common mistake especially for those with acne-prone or oily skin) is detrimental to the skin. As all the “good” oils and outermost, protective barrier are stripped away, skin isn’t just left parched – it’s left completely vulnerable. Dry skin isn’t just uncomfortable – it can actually cause an increase in oil production that leads to more blackheads and breakouts. 2. Exfoliating acne-erupted skin with a granular exfoliant. Speaking of harsh… We know your first instinct is to go gung-ho on those blemishes , but scrubbing will only make things worse. Using a granular exfoliant scratches at pimples, leaving them open and raw. Instead, use a chemical exfoliant. A Salicylic Acid-based cleanser not only helps promote faster healing of acne, but also dissolves away any dulling, pore-clogging buildup to reduce congestion and future breakouts. 3. Popping pimples and squeezing blackheads . The urge to pop a pesky pimple or squeeze a gnarly blackhead is seemingly irresistible (if you’re curious as to why, find out here ), but remember: you know better. No good can come of it; your skin is left blotchy, red, and irritated. You’ve also just spread bacteria to those open wounds, increasing your risk of infection and inflammation. The immediate aftermath isn’t the worst part, though. Picking and squeezing nearly guarantees leaving behind acne marks or permanent scarring. Moral of the story? Hands off . No pimple popping under any circumstances, and leave blackhead extractions to the professionals. 4. Double dipping into jars . Always wash your hands to minimize spreading bacteria, dirt, and oils on your face and in your products. And if you’re going to double dip, don’t : wash those hands again. Beauty Tip : Do as our aestheticians do – ensure everything’s sanitary by scooping out product with a spatula (or a cotton swab!) 5. Skipping eye cream . The skin around your eyes is extremely thin and delicate , which means it requires specialized care. Apply eye cream twice daily to prevent dehydration, fine lines, wrinkles, and sagging. We recommend starting in your early twenties – but it’s always better late than never. Take it from Mario Badescu himself: “Every man or woman over the age of 21 should apply an eye cream in the morning and in the evening, as a part of the daily routine. There are no exceptions.” 6. Over-doing it . Too many cooks spoil the broth. While we’re delighted at your exuberance, too many products can leave your skin confused, imbalanced, and sensitive. This is especially pertinent when testing new products; to minimize irritation (and at the most basic level, figure out whether or not a product works well with your skin), introduce one product at a time. It takes at least a month for your skin to get accustomed to something new (but stop use immediately if any burning, itching, or stinging is experienced). Start simple. Stick with your Sacred Six plus sunscreen — cleanser, toner, moisturizer and/or sunscreen, eye cream, exfoliant, and mask – because it’s a foundation that not only covers all bases, but works . Once you’ve established a regimen that your skin loves, then add on the extras ( serums , additional masks, spot treatments, etc. ) … but just a few. Remember: simple and gentle is always the most effective. 7. Applying products out of order. It’s not so slap-dash-and-go with skin care. There’s an order that begs to be followed for utmost efficacy. It’s easy to remember if you think of it in terms of applying in order of consistency. To ensure that your skin better absorbs each layer, thin to thick is the way to go. For example: 1. Cleanser 2. Toner 3. Serum (if applicable) 4. Eye Cream 5. Moisturizer/Cream Spot treatment (for occasional acne breakouts) And a few extra tips: spritz hydrating sprays before and/or after your moisturizer as needed, and apply a serum under your mask for additional benefits. 8. Going to bed with makeup on . Just don’t do it. No. Excuses. 9. Not washing your makeup brushes or pillowcases regularly . We talk about this skin sin here , and how to properly clean your makeup brushes (thanks to pro Chad Hayduk!) here . 10. Not clocking enough hours of sleep . It’s not called beauty sleep without reason : insufficient sleep is scientifically linked to accelerating physical signs of aging as well as the skin’s ability to repair itself. Plus, no sleep means more stress, which means hormonal imbalances that cause inflammation and breakouts. Related posts: Your Skin Care Regimen: Order Matters Which comes first, serum or moisturizer?

This is a travel favorite for two reasons: first, it is the perfect weight to keep skin soft even in warm weather and second the delicious apricot scent lingers with perfect subtlety, allowing me forego traditional fragrance altogether. Herbal Hydrating Serum – This weightless water-based hydrator is like a drink of water for the skin. The truth is, this is one of my year-round staples, but when travelling to warmer climates it becomes indispensable. Rose Hips Mask – One tends to become very aware of the affect that recycled airplane skin has on the skin when one must stand up in front of a room of people and talk skin care. This mask helps me save face (literally!) by gently refining and restoring my tired, slightly dehydrated post-travel skin. What’s that? How was Houston, you ask? So fun! I met lots of friendly people, went shopping at The Galleria, ate tacos at CityCentre, and strolled around The Museum District. Mission definitely accomplished!

Check out these beauty steals : Facial Spray with Aloe, Herbs and Rosewater ($7) This one is a favorite of nearly every Mario Badescu fan. It can be used anytime, anywhere (I keep one in my purse and at home!) to revitalize and soothe your skin and spirits. It’s also fantastic for setting makeup after application or refreshing makeup following a long day. Ever feel gross after a workout, but no time to hit the showers right away? That’s the sort of thing this product is perfect for. A.H.A. Botanical Body Soap ($8) Your body needs exfoliation, especially if you have acne breakouts on your back, shoulders, or chest. This body wash has fresh fruit extracts (Alpha Hydroxy Acids from Papaya and Grapefruit) to break down dead skin cells for softer, smoother, and clearer skin. Special Hand Cream with Vitamin E ($8) The last time I visited the Mario Badescu Skin Care Salon, my hands were dry, scaly, and cracking. When the consultants urged me to try this hand cream, I warned them that I’d been suffering from terribly dry hands for a long time and that nothing short of a miracle was going to save them. After a few days, my hands were hydrated, soft, and smooth. Every trace of redness, dryness, and wrinkling was gone. Carnation Eye Makeup Remover Oil ($6) This extremely gentle eye makeup remover is a true steal—it even removes waterproof products while soothing the eye area. Suitable for everyone, including those of you with sensitive skin. Related posts: HALLOWEEN MADNESS!

It is wise to use an eye cream on a daily basis to help treat, nourish and slow the formation of fine lines. To make the most of your eye area care, here’s a tip: refrigerate two metal spoons and place them underneath your eyes for about five to ten minutes prior to applying an eye cream that is suitable for you. The cool sensation of the spoons will help constrict the blood vessels, thereby helping to temporarily alleviate puffiness. You’ll look more rested, too. Which eye cream are you using?

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Kimberly Yang"],"url":"https://blog.mariobadescu.com/fall-beauty-tip/","Text":["Warmer weather and lots of sun have had us reaching for pink glosses and stains, but come the first cool breezes of Fall, all pretty brights go back into the drawers as deeper shades come out to play. Vampy, burgundy lips are on trend this fall – and with it? A minimal but perfect complexion, of course! You know the basics – find a cleanser that suits your fall skin . Don’t know which toner to follow with? We’ve got a breakdown guide for your perusal. Make sure you’re properly hydrated and moisturized as well – the key to a healthier, more luminous complexion is plenty of water and a good moisturizer . Drier skin in need of a little bit of radiance? Try adding our Herbal Hydrating Serum for a lightweight, dewy finish (here at Mario, dewy skin is always in). There’s a difference between glowing and oily, however; should oily skin, acne-prone skin need some shine control, here’s a little #MBBeautyTip : try dusting a bit of our Special Healing Powder along your T-Zone , alone or over your favorite foundation for some double duty action (you know we love nothing more than when beauty and skincare come together!). The sulfur-based powder will help absorb excess oil and fight existing blemishes. (Click the link to tweet this tip!) And because your lips are your focal point with this bold bordeaux, pay them extra care and attention. Give them a good ol’ scrub every night to keep them plump and soft; after all, they need regular exfoliation too! Doing so keeps them smooth while promoting blood flow for plumper, rosier lips. DIY a lip scrub of your own ! Scrape a bit of your favorite balm in a small jar or bowl. Stir in about 1 teaspoon of brown sugar, or until the consistency becomes quite lumpy and grainy in texture. Slather it on your lips and thoroughly – but gently! – exfoliate. Rinse off the excess, pop on a bit more balm, and you’re ready to wake up to luscious lips the next morning. Ready to rock the bold lip? Reapply lip balm before you start your daily skincare and makeup regimen to prep your lips. You need a soft, smooth base for an easy and pretty application, so let the lip treatment work its magic and soak into the skin. Be generous, but be sure to blot off any excess product before you apply your lipstick. And voila! You have yourself beautifully soft, smooth lips. . . .

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by admin"],"url":"https://blog.mariobadescu.com/10-signs-you-might-be-a-beauty-junkie/","Text":["Okay, okay, okay! Guilty as charged. Throw the book at me. Take me away. I just can’t help myself. I’m a beauty junkie. How many of you out there are also guilty? If you can relate to more than 3 of these, I think it’s time to seek some help. . . . 1. Your medicine cabinet. Your friend walks into your bathroom “looking for a tylenol” and when she opens the medicine cabinet she is knocked unconscious by the avalanche of cleansers, hair serums, eye creams and zit creams that come tumbling out. You know she was snooping anyways, so she deserved it anyway. I hope you have insurance. 2. Make-up over money? You haven’t paid your electric bill, cell phone bill or paid your sister back the $500 you owe her but you just bought the most amazing 2000 watt hair dryer that can dry your hair straight in under 5 minutes. 3. Shopping issues. Count the bottles of self tanner in your bathroom cabinet. If it’s more than 3 and they are all about half used, you’re a beauty junkie. How many bottles of self tanner do you need at once? The answer is one. There is no rehab for this. 4. Variety problems. 75% of your lipstick, lipgloss and nail polish are almost all the same color. Hey, you know what you like…you just keep buying more stuff! Problem. Serious problem. 5. Celebrity lust. You just saw the celeb-du-jour wearing the trendiest nail polish. You buy the exact same one even though it looks awful on you and it cost $25. You wear it anyway and think everyone who sees you will start wearing it too, making you the trendsetter. I’m thinking Rihanna yellow. Yikes. Not cool. 6. Shower power. It takes you 10 minutes of water wasting in the shower to decide which shower gel, body scrub, shave gel, shampoo and conditioner to use. (Be green, people! Decide before turning the water on. Take a quick shower – it’s better for your skin and the environment.) 7. Merry…Christmas…? Holiday time comes and you get home from the mall with new lipstick, foundation, mascara, perfume, wrinkle serum, body cream and you’re out of money and bought no one a present. Well, no one except yourself. Oh well, you deserve it. 8. Situational dedication. Your gym bag, work locker, and boyfriend’s apartment all have a complete set of your skin care, hair care, and make-up products. You should never be caught off guard or unprepared. You never know, you may run into Matthew McConaughey in Starbucks. You need to look fierce, always! 9. Throw something out? The vegetable bin in your refrigerator has your overload of beauty products that no longer fit in your bathroom and on your dresser. Hey, at least there they are cool and dry and won’t be rancid when you get to them in 2013. 10. So necessary. You steal Equal and napkins from Dunkin Donuts, you reuse ziplock bags and tin foil but your Louis Vuitton make-up case cost $200 and is only big enough to hold one lipstick and a blush. . . . Let me know – how many of these do you relate to? I want to hear your stories! We’ll publish the best ones.

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Jill"],"url":"https://blog.mariobadescu.com/beauty-sleep-2/","Text":["Did you know? Melatonin and beautiful skin go hand-in-hand. After all, they don’t call it ‘beauty sleep’ for nothing! Allow me to explain. Travel back in time with me to a not-so-distant past in which electric lights, TVs, and the Internet were not a part of regular daily life. Transport yourself even further back to a place in history where most people on earth farmed the land for sustenance. You’ll find that sleep patterns were drastically different than they are today. (Read: Why sleep is so important for beautiful skin ) At night, the body produces a hormone called melatonin to help you fall asleep. The body senses that it’s time to produce melatonin when it gets dark. Unfortunately, bright indoor lighting, television glare, and computer screens give the body the false impression that it’s still day. But no worries! Just because you don’t necessarily need to be up early to milk the cows doesn’t mean that you can’t also benefit from your body’s natural sleep rhythms. It’s important to limit your internet and television time at night. Personally, I like to read by a dim light while sipping on a favorite (decaffeinated) tea. I turn off all the lights in my house that I don’t really need to have on. At the very least, set a TV/Internet curfew and stick to it. Sunday night is my favorite time to reset my sleep schedule; since most of us deviate from our normal sleep patterns on the weekends, using your body’s natural resources to fall asleep can be incredibly helpful—to both your sleep schedule AND your skin.

If you pick up your Buffering Lotion in Brea, masks in Manhattan Beach, or Cucumber Cleansing Lotion in Culver City, you are on Allie’s turf. Since the temperatures are nice and warm now, we thought Allie would be the perfect subject for our latest installment of #MarioMy5, our blog series in which we ask MB staffers to whittle down their favorites from the line to just five essentials. Here at MB HQ Allie is known for her can-do attitude, wide smile, and irreverent sense of humor. Not to mention that every frigid East Coast winter we find it nearly impossible to resist living vicariously through Allie with her surf (literally. She’s a surf mom!) and sun lifestyle as we are shoveling ourselves out of the snow and trying not to slip on ice. Allie’s 5 Here are Allie’s five in her own words: Alpha Grapefruit Cleansing Lotion: Between the traffic and June Gloom here in LA I need a little brightening up in my day. One of my fave MB toners is our Alpha Grapefruit Cleansing lotion. I use it morning and night! It brightens and hydrates. Vitamin C Serum: Afterward I use another gem of a brightener our AMAZING Vitamin C Serum. Collagen Moisturizer SPF 15: To be topped off with a daily usage of Collagen Moisturizer SPF 15. It’s light, hydrating, and helps keep the sun’s rays at bay. Enzyme Revitalizing Mask: When my skin is getting a bit dehydrated and lifeless, I bring it back with the ever so yummy Enzyme Revitalizing Mask. It adds hydration and the glow I need. Glycolic Eye Cream: For a nice dewy look around the “old” eye area I warm up some of our Glycolic Eye Cream. #MBSkinTip: a great sleeping eye cream for the side sleeper. Keeps the eyes supple and hydrated while you’re tossing and turning. Botanical Exfoliating Scrub: Last but not least, the Botanical Exfoliating Scrub, what can I say . . . super gentle, exfoliates just enough, and keeps skin hydrated with the Coconut Extract.

In fact, the Buffering Lotion is a pretty unique product. Its lightweight consistency helps allow for the product’s active ingredient (sulfur) to be absorbed into the skin. And if you have cystic acne, you know how important it is to get to the root of the problem. Here’s our extra tip for using the Buffering Lotion—for when you need to get aggressive with cystic acne: Apply the Buffering Lotion as usual (using a clean fingertip) to the affected area and then apply a thin layer of Drying Mask over it. Rinse after 15 minutes and then reapply the Buffering Lotion. When you want to stop cystic acne in its tracks or treat existing cystic breakouts, give this insider tip a try!

Medicine cabinets and “ Spotted! ” quickies are our thing – now we’re adding the classic “What’s In Her Bag” to the mix featuring all of our favorite industry insiders. First up… WHO : Nicole Darmanin . Our very own PR girl (head of Public Relations at Mario Badescu, if we’re being technical here), native Brooklynite and lover of all things beauty related. (She’s also my go-to for makeup tips; she’s worked as a makeup artist, and who wouldn’t trust a girl with over 100 lip glosses?) WHAT : Her beloved Rebecca Minkoff striped canvas bucket bag . Nautical stripes make the perfect summer day trip to Coney Island. It’s not just functional, though. She says: “ This bag makes me happy . I look at it and I’m happy that it is summertime and I have places to go, trinkets to collect and a cheerful bag to put them all in!” WHERE : A weekend getaway to Coney Island, the place synonymous to cotton candy (yum!) and prizes (woohoo!). We should add budding photographer to her bio. WHY : There’s rhyme and reason behind everything a woman carries. Never question anything’s place in the handbag, like why she has a kitty or three lipglosses (at all times!) with her. Nook Color . My sister Dani gave me this Nook Color, I average about a book a week, my Nook saves a lot of trees. It helps me pass the time on my subway ride back from Coney Island which is at the very bottom of Brooklyn. Mario Badescu Lip Wax with SPF 15. This is so much more than a balm, it repairs. The formula melts right into your lips on contact and the rose hip oil in the formula is very healing. Mario Badescu Body Sun Block SPF 30 . I love this because it protects but feels like a body lotion which is perfect for days when I know my skin is exposed but I’m not laying on a beach. It doesn’t feel like a heavy sun screen and the seaweed and Vitamin E in the formula make me feel like I’m being extra good to my skin. Mario Badescu Facial Spray . Spending hours outside in the Coney Island sun requires a few breaks to freshen up. Purell Wet Ones Metrocard Armour Beauty ‘Lucy’ & ‘Marilyn’ lip glosses . My friend Theo Kogan is the creator of this lip gloss line which I love. I like mixing these 2 shades together, it makes an iridescent papaya color. Three Custom Color ‘Vivacious Violet’ lip gloss . I’ve had a thing for violet lip gloss for years, [this] is one of my current favorites. Tiffany & Co. coin purse : My life long best friend Kara gave me this little coin purse from Tiffany’s a few years ago. I always tell myself that I am going use it to keep the puddle of loose change off of the bottom of my bag but it never happens. Ray-Bans . I’m kind of sensitive and can’t stand the sun in my eyes, these are one of my many pairs of Ray Ban sunnies. A cute kitty : Devin (a VIP member of my honorary family) won this kitty for me. . . .

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Jill"],"url":"https://blog.mariobadescu.com/powder-before-foundation/","Text":["Does your foundation ever get a little funky by the end of the day? Mine used to wear off by 5pm every afternoon, even with a dusting of powder—especially in my somewhat oily T-zone. That’s when I discovered, like many of you have, the concept of applying powder before foundation. Have you tried it yet? The theory behind it is that it helps you use less liquid foundation while getting more coverage, and that your makeup will last longer. Even better than traditional powder, though, is our Special Healing Powder . It will simultaneously tone down redness while absorbing excess oil. After you apply your moisturizer and primer (if you’re using a primer), wait a few minutes for these to absorb. Then, dust a light coating of the Special Healing Powder on your skin. Proceed as usual with your foundation application.

Let’s face it—if you’re over 30, nothing you think is cool is actually still cool (at least in the eyes of the younger set!). Fortunately, skin care is universal, and a lot of people first start thinking about their complexion during the teen years. Check out these perfect gifts: For someone who likes pretty things. No question here—wrap the Facial Spray with Aloe, Herbs and Rosewater and our Flower & Tonic Mask together. For the teenager with acne. The following gift recommendations apply only if (a) you know this teenager very well and (b) they’ve asked for help with their acne. Otherwise, giving an acne-fighting gift might be more hurtful than helpful. If your teenager fits the above criteria, go for the Acne Control Kit or Acne Repair Kit ! [Read: How to suggest acne products with hurting someone’s feelings ] For the teen who is heavily into makeup and beauty. Our MB Favorites gift set is the perfect way to get them interested in serious skin care. For the kid who has definitely started shaving. You can either go all-out with a gift set ( Men’s Grooming Basics ) or treat him to our Pre-Shave Conditioner and Peppermint Shaving Cream . When you have NO IDEA what to get them: You can’t go wrong with some body wash ( AHA Botanical Body Soap is a fave!), hand cream ( Special Hand Cream with Vitamin E ), and a shampoo/conditioner combo ( Henna & Semollient Shampoo and Hair Rinsing Conditioner ).

Moments before the doors opened, fully stocked. Who doesn’t love a good peek into a stylish friend’s beauty stash? Out of all of the collections I’ve had the opportunity to see, my very favorite ones always belong to my makeup artist friends. You see, real estate in a makeup artist’s kit is valuable, so I know that whichever products make the cut are the best of the best! With that in mind, I thought I’d share our out-of-stock list from The Makeup Show NYC 2016. These are the pro-favorites that flew off of our shelves and straight into the kits and set bags of our favorite makeup artists: 1. Facial Spray with Aloe, Herbs and Rosewater . Whether they mist it onto clean skin before moisturizer to boost hydration, or after makeup as a final radiance-enhancing step. Pros can’t get enough of this versatile MB must-have. 2. Honey Moisturizer . Skin-softening Honey makes this mid-weight moisturizer perfect for prepping skin for makeup. 3. Summer Shine Body Lotion . Highlight isn’t just for your cheekbones! This silky body lotion applies smoothly and imparts a subtle gold glow to legs, collarbones, and any other place you’d like to show off. 4. Hyaluronic Eye Cream . Pros love this eye cream’s ability to thoroughly hydrate while still being light enough to apply concealer right on top. 5. Aloe Vera Toner . This toner was designed to be used on dry, sensitive, delicate skin types. Makeup artists love it because the mild formula can be used to gently freshen anyone’s skin without irritation. So, which pro favorites will you be adding to your beauty musts? Are any of these in your medicine cabinet?

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Kimberly Yang"],"url":"https://blog.mariobadescu.com/post-inflammatory-hyperpigmentation/","Text":["Post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH) refers to any type of skin discoloration left behind after inflammation (including the inflammation associated with acne). Often referred to as acne marks or macules , this form of hyperpigmentation occurs when inflammation triggers melanin production during the healing process. As blemishes start to clear up, reddish or brown spots take their place. Although PIH is often (misleadingly) grouped with acne scars, PIH is not acne scarring. Acne scars are permanent fixtures that result from irreparable damage to collagen and skin tissue, leaving behind thicker, raised lumps (called hypertrophic scars) or indents (appearing as keloid or atrophic scars). Acne marks, however, are simply changes in pigmentation. The discoloration is only temporary; these marks naturally fade over time. If you’re interested in speeding up this process (who isn’t?) use a Vitamin C-based serum as well as skin-brightening products that include Kojic Acid. Our two biggest recommendations– the two products we use ourselves– are the Whitening Mask and the Vitamin C Serum . Related posts: Q & A: Getting Rid Of Acne Scars Q.

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Sara Kosmyna"],"url":"http://blog.mariobadescu.com/does-makeup-protect-your-skin-from-the-sun/","Text":["Everyone loves a dual-purpose product. Walking through the beauty aisle, it’s impossible to ignore all of the makeup lines that list sun protection factor (SPF) in their foundations. I used to believe that a dusting of only mineral makeup on my face would provide full coverage from the sun. Regrettably, while these products may contain SPF, it’s hard to know how much protection you’re actually getting, since this varies with how much or how little product you use. Through my false sense of comfort, I was making my skin more vulnerable than I knew. Ideally, a makeup with sun protection should be used in conjunction with a moisturizer that has an SPF of at least 15. This provides two coats of necessary protection. Additionally, layering an antioxidant serum (like our Vitamin C Serum ) under your moisturizer is another great way to help fight against free radicals. How do you protect your skin from the sun?

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Kimberly Yang"],"url":"https://blog.mariobadescu.com/workout/","Text":["I’m one of those girls who likes the idea of being a dedicated fitness queen- running every morning, gym at least five days a week and a bit of hot yoga to start off every weekend. In my Twitter bio I admit to having sporadic Pilates tendencies, because my workout is exactly that: sporadic. At least I’m diligent with my skin care regimen ! The point is this: regardless of how dedicated (or not) I am to my choice of exercise, a good workout needs an equally good post-workout beauty routine. While sweating is fabulous for the mind, soul and body, it’s not so great for the complexion as it becomes a breeding ground for bacteria (which leads to breakouts!). Never walk out of a gym/studio/class/your living room red-faced and sweaty. You kick your booty into shape, we get your skin into shape. Deal? 1. Cleanse ! My favorite and only post-workout cleanser is the Enzyme Cleansing Gel ; none other will ever replace it in my yoga bag or bathroom countertop. I personally prefer something creamier for everyday use, but immediately following a particularly sweaty Pilates/Zumba/dance session, all I want is to feel super clean and incredibly refreshed . The Enzyme Cleansing Gel does exactly that, and trust – there’s nothing better than feeling rejuvenated after working your heart out for over an hour. (The Enzyme Cleansing Gel is usually recommended for oily or combination/oily skin types; be sure to use the cleanser that is right for your skin!) 2. Steam it out . Sometimes I’ll pop into a sauna, but if I’m just working out in the comfort of my own home (thanks to Tracy Anderson), I’ll recreate a quick facial sauna and relax for about 20 minutes or so before I drink my weight in coconut water. A quick splash of water to clean and then… 3. Moisturize . By now you all know of my inability to go through any skincare process without moisturizing properly ; the Oil-Free Moisturizer SPF 17 never leaves my handbag for that very reason. I love that this one in particular is incredibly lightweight and leaves my skin feeling nothing but hydrated and happy. 4. … and because I’m obsessed with glowing skin , I’ll spritz my face with the Rosewater Facial Spray . Part of the beauty of exercising is getting that natural post-workout glow, so why not enhance it? If by some chance I have to be seen in public straight out of a sweat session, I’ll give my body a few spritzes of the rosewater as well. It doubles incredibly well as a (hydrating!) body mist that leaves you smelling oh-so-lovely. Your only giveaway would be the yoga pants and neon sneakers. 5. Avoid makeup: let your skin breathe . Work that post-sweat glow! If you’re a girl who can’t be without her lipgloss, though, give your pout a few swipes of a glossy lip balm . No one will know the difference. . . .

When you’re cold, what’s better than a long, hot shower? I personally love to indulge in a relaxing, steamy shower, but I’ve decided to stop: hot water can dry out the skin by stripping some of its natural, necessary oils. For some of us, the skin gets even drier during the fall and winter months. Worse, excessive showering in very hot water can really cause problems for people with skin that is already super dry. Turn down the temperature while showering or bathing and you’ll do your skin a favor. It’s also a good idea to spend less time in the shower or cut back on how often you shower if it really isn’t necessary. Don’t forget to take the time to indulge in one of our luxurious body washes to enhance your shower experience. After your shower, catch some extra warmth and sip some hot apple cider or cuddle up with a loved one.

We don’t play favorites, but the customers do. We’re not complaining, but let’s not forget the products that, too often, fly under the radar. They deserve the spotlight too! . . . UP-AND-COMING STARLET : Aloe Moisturizer SPF 15 NOTEWORTHY INGREDIENTS: Aloe (hence the name). WHAT: It’s a moisturizer. An aloe-enriched, oil-free moisturizer. And while all that aloe makes for a thicker consistency that gives it more body and moisturizer than your average oil-free variety, it’s one that’s easily absorbed, hydrating and helps protect against UV rays. WHY: Not only is it suitable for combination/oily sensitive skin types, but it’s perfect for acne-prone skin as well. Aloe Vera helps soothe the sensitive skin whilst the moisturizer hydrates and softens skin. . . . Have you tried the Aloe Moisturizer SPF 15 yet?

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Sara Kosmyna"],"url":"https://blog.mariobadescu.com/green-tea/","Text":["Green tea is an ancient drink from China with a great reputation for its health benefits. It was first brewed nearly 5,000 years ago during the reign of Emporor Chen Nung. Chock full of powerful antioxidants that help ward off free radicals and neutralize oxidative damage (the main culprits behind premature aging) green tea has been turned to for thousands of years as both a drink and as medicine, to help heal wounds and regulate blood sugar. Today, this natural ingredient has made the leap from the cup to the skincare cabinet, as seen in our Oil-Free Moisturizer SPF 30 . The green tea extract used in skincare comes from the steaming and drying of the tea plant, Camellia sinesis . Check out the difference it can make in your skin!

Even if I were a millionaire, I’d still be a little frugal. Ok, maybe not. However, wealthy or not, I love skin care products that can multitask and yield good results. Don’t you love stuff that offers dual benefits? I’m pleased to say that Mario Badescu offers a number of products that do just that. Keep reading to find out what those little Mario multipurpose treasures are. Cellufirm Drops Heralded as an anti-aging serum (and rightfully so), these little babies can also be layered underneath an eye cream since they are gentle enough to be used on the eye area. Not only do you apply a thin layer of it on your face, but be sure to dab some on your ring finger and smooth it around the outer eye area. Special Cucumber Lotion Yes, this toner is meant for oily/acne-prone skin to help control oil and dry up blemishes, but it can be also used as a (drum roll, please)…foot spray to disinfect the feet and help kill bacteria and odor. Who knew? Simply pour some Special Cucumber Lotion in a clean spray bottle and mist those feet! Rolling Peel with AHA Although it is a fabulous exfoliation/moisturizing treatment for the face, (which is automatically deemed a dual beauty bonus) our Rolling Cream Peel with AHA can also be used as a foot or hand treatment. It contains AHAs (alpha hydroxy acids) to help dissolve dead skin cells, while Shea Butter and Vitamin E will saturate your feet or hands for maximum moisture. Eye & Lip Sunscreen (SPF 15) Ok, ok, this one is intentionally a double-duty treatment. The name is self explanatory, so need I say more? Everyone’s skin can use a double dose of goodness, so give these Mario multi-taskers a try!

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Jill"],"url":"https://blog.mariobadescu.com/skin-care-11/","Text":["1. You can have perfect skin without any effort. Rom-com heroines are always going to bed without washing their faces and then magically waking up with a perfect face full of makeup. Don’t let this fool you or make you wonder why you don’t look so flawless all the time. It’s just movie magic! Behind the scenes, the actors are receiving excellent skin care. Even Katherine Heigl has to wash her face. 2. Window cleaner clears up acne. Remember My Big Fat Greek Wedding ? Nia Vardalos’ new husband confesses that he cleared up his pre-wedding zit with some window cleaner. Maybe that was a joke? But let it be said: do NOT put harsh cleansers (especially ones with ammonia!) anywhere near your face or eyes. It’s only the fumes making them think that window cleaner can clear up zits! 3. Toothpaste clears up acne. Seriously, let’s stop putting weird stuff on our faces. Remember the 90s sitcom Mad About You ? If not, it was a really cute show about the sweet romance between newly-married Paul Reiser and Helen Hunt. She, of course, gets a zit the night before their wedding, and what does she use to try to clear it up? Toothpaste!* Save the toothpaste for your teeth! 4. Only bad guys have troubled skin Guys, this one really bothers me. We so often see movie villains with skin issues that it’s impossible to shake the idea that you’re somehow naturally ‘bad’ if you’re dealing with a difficult skin problem. Can we get rid of this idea for good? *Just an aside, but the characters in Mad About You were living in Union Square—a short cab ride up to our Midtown salon ; Helen Hunt could have gotten the Drying Lotion and actually cleared up her zit!

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Kimberly Yang"],"url":"https://blog.mariobadescu.com/cubicle/","Text":["When clocking in (at least) eight hours per day, five days a week, it’s safe to say that – like it or not – our cubicles become our second home. They are the only areas of the office we can decorate to our little hearts’ content (unless you’re like me and have yet to start even after three years…) so our little office spaces often start to feel like our little sanctuary. Our home-away-from-home. But sometimes insta -collages and teeny-tiny succulents aren’t enough when the clock strikes 3 p.m. If you’re a glass-half-full kind of person, then sure , we’re well into the home stretch. But unless you’ve been subsisting on espresso IV drips or have been blessed with the best night’s sleep ever , it’s nearly inevitable to start feeling drone-like. Was it the late night? Is it the never-ending pile of work with deadlines practically screaming today ? Was it the two pizza slices you had during lunch because you forgot to pack your usual tuna-over-spinach salad? I can actually hear you thinking: My goodness , is all that dairy and grease going to give me a pimple right before my four o’clock meeting with the big guns?! You swear you feel it coming. Quick, before give yourself a conniption: pizza will not make you break out . (Nor will eating chocolate. It’s a little more complicated than one tiny indulgence.) But just in case you do feel a little bugger surfacing, it’s paramount to keep your desk well-stocked so you can survive the nine-to-five workday no matter what . 1. WAKE UP! Stand up, shake it out, and resist round two at the coffee machine. Opt for a decaf tea instead. You want to be able to sleep later tonight to avoid perpetuating this cycle of drabness, no? Grab a banana , steep a cuppa, and refresh with a few generous spritzes of our Rosewater Facial Spray . It’ll rejuvenate your day’s makeup so it looks freshly applied; plus, natural botanical and herbal extracts will give your skin the boost it needs. 2. Drink up . You need more than just tea: good ol’ H 2 0 is crucial for mental and physical health, so keep hydrated throughout the day. In fact, we count it as one of the best beauty products of all time. Our tip? Keep a big bottle of water (1.5 – 2 L, because if we shoot for the moon, we’ll land in the stars) at your desk and make it a priority to finish at least one fill-up between answering all those emails. 3. Plump your pout . The secret to healthy, fuller-looking lips is keeping them well-moisturized. Keep a Lip Wax (or two) handy for easy re-application. 4. Wake up those tired eyes . Computer work is hard on the eyes! Renew dry, puffy under-eyes with our Ceramide Herbal Eye Cream . It’s a lightweight, creamy formula that provides instant, easily absorbed hydration. Plus, it’s packed with nourishing oils and antioxidant-rich Rose Hips to help brighten and plump up the delicate eye area for an instant reboot. 5. Get your glow on . Sometimes we need a little help in the radiance department; hours of air conditioning can often leave skin dry and tight, and fluorescent lighting certainly isn’t helping the situation. You have two options: the ultra-lightweight Herbal Hydrating Serum or easily-absorbed Rose Hips Nourishing Oil . Both are easy to apply (only a few drops are needed) and are designed to help instantly reduce surface dehydration, minimize flakiness, and restore a natural, healthy glow. Still craving a little more brightening action? (Trust. We all do.) Stash a highlighting concealer pen in your pencil cup. It’s quick, no-fuss application: simply apply under the eyes, around the nose, under the brow, and/or on the cheekbones and tap to blend. Look ma, no hands brushes! Just make sure you keep a bottle of hand sanitizer nearby pre-blending and after application to avoid causing breakouts. 6. Color me mine . Sometimes a pop of color is just what the doctor ordered. Since we prefer things as simple as possible, we’re partial to multi-purpose cream products that – you guessed it! – don’t call for brushes. Plus, creamy formulas lend a hand in creating that dewy, fresh finish we’re all after. A bright peach or pink blended onto the cheeks and lightly dabbed over the lips will instantly perk up your complexion. You’ll look and feel brighter and fresher. 7. The sky’s the limit . Sure, it’s a good motivational quote to tack onto your bulletin board. But we’re talking you: if your hair is showing the day’s wear (again, central air is not friendly), it’s time to give it quick lift. A few spritzes of our Nucleic Moisturizing Hair Rinse followed by some strategic tszuj -ing is fantastic for restoring moisture, shine, and body to limp hair. Locks feeling a little more greasy than you’d like? A travel-size dry shampoo will help refresh instantly. Give your hair a quick flip (careful not to bang your head on the desk, though) and voila , volume a la a blow-dry in less time than it takes to say “Is it time to go yet?” And if you’re really in need of a lift, let’s get literal. Hair-ties and bobby pins should always be kept at your desk in case you need a high pony or topknot to save the day. . . . What in YOUR at-the-desk survival kit?

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Lee Ann"],"url":"http://blog.mariobadescu.com/winter/","Text":["Now that winter is here, dehydrated skin is a widespread condition among oily and dry skin types (and everything in between). To be clear, dehydration is the result of a lack of water in the skin, whereas true dry skin comes from a lack of oil production. Anyone can suffer from dehydration. If your skin is dehydrated, don’t worry! We’ve got you covered on cold-climate-induced dehydration. There’s just something about ‘H’ when it comes to hydration, because these skin savers will prevent or help combat dehydration: Herbal Hydrating Serum This unique serum is not applied underneath a moisturizer, but rather layered on top of it. To my oily-skinned friends: no need to shy away from this product; it is oil-free and contains water-binding ingredients such as Glycerin to ensure your skin is getting the dose of hydration it needs. Humidifier Now that the indoor heat is starting to crank up, bear in mind that it can dry out the air, thus dry out your skin. Invest in a quality humidifier and use it at night while you sleep. It helps keep moisture in the air, thereby helping your skin to stay moist and supple. Hyaluronic Day Cream This face cream is ideal for the winter months as it contains super hydrating Hyaluronic Acid. It is ideal for combination or dry skin types. Hooray to the 3 H’s for hydration!

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Kimberly Yang"],"url":"http://blog.mariobadescu.com/weekend-getaway-whats-toiletries-bag/","Text":["So I lied – there’s no weekend getaway on the itinerary. Not exactly at least – no beaches or lazy mornings are on the horizon – just a quick business trip that just so happens to fall on a weekend. (I’m a full-time copywriter, part-time dancer and salsa instructor.) Technicalities, eh? So what’s in the bag? Enzyme Cleansing Gel . The ultimate go-to cleanser. Cucumber Cleansing Lotion . The toner I use to help prevent acne breakouts and control shine. Vitamin C Serum . A little bottle of dewiness! Ceramide Eye Gel . I’ll be popping this little guy in the mini fridge for a morning pick-me-up and instant eye area de-puffer. Oil-Free Moisturizer SPF 17 . A steadfast favorite and skincare must. Temporary Lifting Mask . My roommates will have to bear with me, big nights call for bringing out the big guns which in this case is the ideal special occasion mask that immediately tightens, cleanses, and refines the skin. Lip balms . For obvious reasons. I always have multiples because (a) I’m a lip balm hoarder, and (b) I cannot be without lip balm, ever. Shampoo & conditioner . AHA Botanical Body Soap . At least 16-hours of dancing will be done and dusted each day, and if you’re privy to my post-workout beauty routine , you’ll know that this cleanser is an absolute must for keeping skin fresh and free of acne-causing bacteria (you know the deal: sweating is great for the mind/body/soul, also becomes a breeding ground for bacteria). Formula 200 Body Lotion . Few things are more dangerous than a slippery body lotion when partner dancing and doing in-air tricks, so this formula is one of my favorites. It keeps the arms and gams glowing without leaving a slipper slick behind. Summer Shine Body Lotion . For subtle highlighting shimmer and feeling summery. Facial cleansing wipes . Instant refreshers between workshops and things. Rosewater Facial Spray . Always necessary for refreshing, rehydrating, or setting makeup. Mini deodorant . Smelling nice is always a good idea. Assorted Band-Aids . There is no guarantee that my poor feet will survive this trip, so bandages are most definitely a necessity, as are… Toe separators . You use them for pedicures, I use them post-dancing in my salsa shoes. Nude nail polish . For touch-ups and inevitable chips along the way. Emory board Disposable razors Hair grips, bobby pins, and clips Hairspray Teasing comb Dry shampoo . To refresh hair every few hours. Perfume . . . Related posts: What’s In Your Bag?

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Lee Ann"],"url":"https://blog.mariobadescu.com/rock-and-roll/","Text":["I love music. From rock and roll to classic and contemporary, I love rocking out to some good tunes while doing pretty much anything- washing my face, driving, and even organizing my closet. Better yet, it’s a privilege to jam to one of my favorite bands at their shows. Nothing compares to a live performance. That being said, there is always a price to pay for a rocked out experience (or any night out for that matter): the overly crowded venue, second-hand smoke in the air and direct sun exposure (if the concert is outdoors). Moreover, if one chooses, the beer is flowing like crazy. All of this can wreak havoc on the skin: dull, dehydrated and maybe a sun-scorched complexion. Maybe you’ll be too tired when you get home to wash your face. ( Find out here why this is a bad idea. ) Continue reading to get easy tips on how to prep your skin before a night (or day) out. 1. Cleanse Start off by washing your face with a cleanser appropriate for your skin type. 2. Tone With a cotton ball or wipe, apply a toner (suitable for your skin type) all over your face and neck. 3. Treat Apply two to three drops of our Vitamin C Serum all over your face and neck. It contains the Vitamin C to give you a glow and fight the destructive effects of free radicals; Hyaluronic Acid attracts and binds water in the skin to prevent dehydration. 4. Moisturize Put a generous amount of our Oil-Free Moisturizer SPF 30 on your face and neck. The built-in sunscreen provides an ample amount of sun protection—even if the venue is indoors, the car ride to the concert and walking outside from the parking lot to your destination is automatic sun exposure (unless you’re going at nighttime). Otherwise, browse our moisturizers here and choose one according to your skin type. 5. Eye Cream With your ring finger, apply our Hyaluronic Eye Cream on the orbital bone (the area between the upper cheekbone and underneath the eyes). 6. Facial Spray Bring our Facial Spray with Aloe, Herbs & Rosewater with you to the concert. Tuck it away in your bag or simply pour some in a smaller travel-size spray bottle and mist your face before, during and/or after the concert. It will perk up “party-hardy” skin. 7. Post-Concert The day after the concert, give yourself a DIY Facial to ensure your skin is in tip top shape. Going to a concert soon? With these tips, you’ll stave off rock and roll-induced stressed skin!

But let’s not forget the other important things in our life, so let’s talk hair for a moment, here. We all want a head of shiny, healthy hair – but how? Put aside those styling products and start with the basics. Shampoo . Your shampoo should help clarify, clean and nourish . Less is more; keep the ingredient and product list simple. Our All-Purpose Egg Shampoo is perfect for all hair types, leaving locks feeling clean and nourished – all due to its protein-rich egg ingredient. (It also doubles as a shower gel!). Or, try our Chamomile Shampoo : it may be gentler , but it does the job of removing buildup . Chamomile extract and Coconut Oil nourish and moisturize for shiny, healthy hair . But if your ends are feeling limp and a bit more straw-like than you’d prefer, reach for our Lecithin Nourishing Shampoo . Jojoba oil and Lecithin helps repair dry, damaged locks for replenished and nourished hair. The next step? A good conditioner . One that truly nourishes and hydrates the hair without weighing it down (we all know too well the horror story of conditioner that left hair matted and greasy…). Thus said, our Hair Rinsing Conditioner is MB’s only conditioner for good reason. It leaves all hair types soft, smooth and tangle-free… and the plus? You’ll still smell the slightest of a deliciously tropical fragrance. It’s all about the right basics. But if you’re still in want of that extra oomph , here’s our little hair care secret : The Nucleic Moisturizing Hair R inse . It’s a lovely leave-in conditioner, perfect for spritzing anytime, anywhere. Rinse it out, or leave it in: either way, it restores moisture and nourishment, even for the most processed or damaged of hair types. Herbal extracts help soothe and add shine while de-tangling. . . . Have you given any of these hair care products a try yet? Which are your favorites?

If you missed our last installment, check it out here . (We loved hearing all about your March must-haves!) . . . You guys—it’s finally spring! Sure, we were a bit doubtful about its arrival (it snowed on the first day of spring; go figure), but the weather’s been beautiful ever since. It’s official: The sweaters are going away and the spring skincare stash is coming out. These are the April skincare essentials taking prime real estate in our medicine cabinet: Enzyme Cleansing Gel . Your favorite cleanser made the cut! The moment it gets warm out and our skin starts to feel a little more slick than usual, out comes the Enzyme Cleansing Gel. It’s fresh in every which way—which makes it the perfect pick-me-up to get you into the spring mood. Cucumber Cleansing Lotion . Ditto with this toner on the fresh factor. (If you’re curious as to why it’s named a “cleansing lotion,” head on over here .) Great for combination and oily skin types, this cooling formula helps remove excess shine and grime without overdrying skin. Facial Spray . It’s a perennial favorite, but come spring, it’s a necessity. The goal is to look fresh-faced and dewy always—and what easier way to achieve that than with a quick, refreshing mist? Spritz it on before and/or after you apply moisturizer for a hydrating boost. Oil Free Moisturizer SPF 17 . When you start to shed off the heavy layers, it’s time to swap out your winter cream for a lightweight moisturizer. This one is a best-selling favorite because of its easily-absorbed, oil-free formula; plus, it provides essential broad spectrum protection to help shield your skin from damaging UVA/UVB rays. Flower & Tonic Mask . Floral for spring? Groundbreaking. But we’re willing to put up with the Miranda Priestly’s of the world for this mask. Formulated with Gardenia Extract (which contains Ferulic Acid , a powerful natural antioxidant) and natural minerals, our Flower & Tonic Mask helps decongest skin to re-balance your complexion. Enzyme Revitalizing Mask . If you have drier skin in need of a moisturizing boost, this is the mask for you. Our Enzyme Revitalizing Mask does exactly what its name purports to do: revitalize. Natural fruit enzymes from Papaya Extract help break down dulling buildup as a blend of Vitamin A and E Oils provide additional moisture, leaving your skin glowing and radiant. Citrus Body Cleanser . Don’t forget to spring clean your bodycare regimen, too. We’re obsessed with how sweet and fresh this shower gel is; it’s the ideal soap for morning showers or post-gym sessions. Apricot Super Rich Body Lotion . When the pros stash something in their makeup kit, you’d be smart to do the same. We started keeping this one shower-side after seeing one of our favorite MUAs use it on set: it’s creamy, it’s lightly fragranced, and it keeps you glowing head to toe. . . .

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Kimberly Yang"],"url":"https://blog.mariobadescu.com/acne-causes/","Text":["Makeup brushes and pillowcases? Both inanimate objects, but there is a similarity there (I promise). If you only knew me pre- Mario… I go on and on about the irony of me working here given my past history of skincare mishaps and sins ; I’m guessing I would have continued in a downward spiral to the deepest, darkest parts of the skincare equivalent of Dante’s Inferno had I not been saved by Mario Badescu. It’s as dramatic as it sounds when you realize the difference good skincare makes. You wouldn’t believe how many seemingly innocuous things are actually major acne causes. It’s been enlightening every step of the way, ladies and gents. But I digress. Makeup brushes. Pillowcases. Right. Let’s get back on track, shall we? Here’s the story of a girl (hi!) who wouldn’t wear the same outfit within a month’s time, much less in two weeks. Little did she know college would soon change said philosophy. There she was, naïve and oblivious, dolling up every morning. (Here’s the thing: negligence is a crime – well, tort – in the court of law. Naivety is not a defense.) A swipe of bronzer. A pinch of blush. Smudge that liner, blend some ubiquitous neutral brown haphazardly across the lids. One last sweep of bronzer across the cheekbones. And another dusting. For good luck, posterity and all that jazz. (What I miss out on in sunbathing/ SPF-ing like a madwoman , I make up in bronzer.) Every day this process would be repeated, and every day I’d be completely unaware of what it was I was actually doing. It wasn’t just color and shimmer I deposited to my face. From pretty pans to skin was essentially a back-and-forth volley of introducing and reintroducing bacteria, oil and other not -so-friendly things to my makeup and my skin . Talk about a dirty party. Do you hear the sirens wailing in the distance? My makeup brushes were the culprit. They were the sole carriers, transporting and orchestrating the transfer of unwanted gunk. And it wasn’t until last year in the midst of a weekly sweep up of my dorm room when I had an epiphany. If that much dusted accumulated within a week’s time, then all that dust in addition to whatever bacteria/oils/etc. was festering on my brushes. In the same way you’d consider washing laundry an integral part of personal hygiene, the principle applies to cleaning your makeup brushes . I immediately high-tailed it to the communal bathroom for a deep cleaning session, and within a week, my skin was noticeably clearer : fewer spots and considerably less congestion along the cheeks and T-Zone where I would fondly bronze up. It’s the smallest things in life that make the biggest difference . Pillowcases fall under the same rule (I told you I’d relate the two seemingly dissimilar objects eventually). If you’re noticing congestion or are experiencing consistent breakouts, wash your pillowcases frequently. Once you eliminate these acne causes, it’ll make a difference. Confessions aired, sins cleared. The weight of the world has been (temporarily) lifted from my shoulders. . . . Check out our Clear Skin Board on Pinterest!

Other times, the acne products don’t work at all, yet they still manage to cause irritation, thereby doubling your skin problems. It can be really disheartening when this happens, and it’s easy to just give up. Here’s the trick for getting clear skin (whether or not your skin is sensitive): use a customized program of skin care. A cleanser that works for a lot of people may not necessarily be the best choice for you. For example, depending on different factors, we might not recommend the Acne Facial Cleanser for you. Instead, we might go with the Enzyme Cleansing Gel or the Seaweed Cleansing Soap. [Read more: How To Choose A Cleanser for Acne-Prone Skin ] Let’s look at a sample regimen for someone with acne and sensitive skin: Cleanser: Enzyme Cleansing Gel Toner: Seaweed Cleansing Lotion Moisturizer: Oil Free Moisturizer SPF 17 Exfoliant: Glycolic Foaming Cleanser 1-2 times a week Mask: Flower & Tonic Mask Drying Lotion for spot treatment at night. We have several ways to help you determine which products are best for you.

Whether you are traveling overseas and enduring a 10 hour flight or flying domestically for only two hours, the recycled air in the plane cabin can severely parch your skin. Luckily for travelers, Mario Badescu Skin Care offers travel tips that will save all skin types from post-flight dehydration. Hydro Emollient Cream Our well known ‘in-flight’ cream is a rich formula that is packed with emollients to impart moisture to skin that is dry from high altitudes and arid atmospheres. Herbal Hydrating Serum Unlike most serums that are meant to be worn underneath a moisturizer, this unique, oil-free formula is meant to be layered on top of a moisturizer. As its name indicates, our Herbal Hydrating Serum will restore hydration back into your skin, leaving it looking supple and moist. Facial Spray with Aloe, Herbs and Rosewater As you’re stepping off the plane, mist your face with our Facial Spray for a fragrant, instant pick-me-up. It contains soothing Herbal Extracts to perk up thirsty skin. Almond & Honey Face Scrub and Face Mask Upon arriving at your destination, take the time to do a quick, mini DIY facial to rescue a tired, traveled complexion. On a cleansed, damp face, apply our Almond & Honey Face Scrub and rinse with tepid water to reveal fresh, rejuvenated skin. Following the scrub, apply a face mask that is appropriate for your skin type. Check out our blog on Face Masks or our web page on the various Masks we carry to find out which one is best for you. Moisturize Post-DIY facial, apply a moisturizer (again, one that is suitable for your skin type) to hydrate and seal in moisture. Remember: before you venture on your journey via airplane, make sure to invest in our fabulous items and follow our travel tips to save your inevitably dehydrated skin. Happy traveling!

Like most of you, I can definitely remember my mother relaxing before a big night out with cool cucumber slices over her eyes. There’s a good reason that this practice has stood the test of time: Cucumbers can work to help reduce inflammation and swelling. Cucumbers are excellent for repair and anti-aging—they are a source of antioxidants , including Vitamin C , as well as specific compounds that combat against aging forces (free radicals) and inflammation. Cucumbers also contain Vitamin A (retinol for very mild exfoliation) and vitamin B-5 to help the skin retain natural moisture.

We couldn’t possibly talk about acne without including an at-home facial! After all, we know many of you don’t live near our Skin Care Salon. Plus, we know that acne can be seriously frustrating, whether you have one pimple or a severe breakout. If whiteheads (acne that comes to the surface of the skin) or cystic acne (those painful bumps under the skin) happen to be your current rival, this DIY Anti-Acne Facial is for you! 1. Cleanse/Exfoliate Start off by washing your face with our Glycolic Foaming Cleanser . It is a cleanser and exfoliant in one—formulated with Glycolic Acid to chemically exfoliate the skin. It is a bad idea to use any type of scrub or manual exfoliant while the skin is actively broken out. 2. Mask Apply a thin layer of our Drying Mask , avoiding the eye area. Leave it on for about 20 minutes and rinse with tepid water. For extra combative action, apply Buffering Lotion before you layer the Drying Mask on your face. 3. Tone With a cotton ball, swipe Special Cucumber Lotion all over your face and neck, avoiding the eye area. 4. Treat Apply a thin layer of our Anti-Acne Serum on areas of your face where you are prone to breaking out. 5. Eye Cream With your ring finger, dab a small amount of eye cream (one that suits your needs) and gently pat around the outer eye area and blend outward. Browse our eye creams here . 6. Moisturize Apply our Oil Free Moisturizer all over your face and neck. 7. Spot Treat With a cotton swab, apply a dab of Drying Lotion at night on affected areas only. Let it dry and rinse off the following morning. Got cystic acne instead of whiteheads? Swap the Drying Lotion for Buffering Lotion instead. Got pesky blackheads?

No worries – head on over to learn what oily , dry , combination and sensitive skin is. . . . We’ve all heard about the trials and tribulations of acne. Teens suffering from breakouts, adults embarrassed at their seemingly ongoing blemishes that “should’ve just been a puberty-thing.” Teens are more prone to breakouts – changes in hormones cause fluctuations which explains changes in skin – but acne isn’t a “teen problem.” Anyone is prone to a breakout – occasional, or chronic. Acne is a skin condition that afflicts both teenagers and adults alike . What does acne skin look like? As with all skin conditions, appearance varies from individual to individual. Blemishes may come as red bumps , white heads or cystic acne (for a thorough breakdown of different types of acne, visit our consulting page ). Skin type is typically combo/oily to excessively oily , experiencing shine and oil in the T-zone or all over and larger pores , blackheads , and whiteheads. So how do I help treat acne skin? Think gentle, but effective treatment ; while instant gratification is on everyone’s minds, the healing and preventing process is gradual . Improper care can lead to infection and permanent scarring, so never pick at existing blemishes, and minimize touching your face (to prevent spreading of bacteria and reducing the urge to squeeze!). Avoid exfoliating with abrasive scrubs; instead, we suggest a product like our Glycolic Foaming Cleanser – glycolic acid helps break down build-up and unclog pores to prevent future breakouts or blackheads.

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Kimberly Yang"],"url":"https://blog.mariobadescu.com/meet-the-intern-kim-her-favorites/","Text":["It’s kind of funny that I’m working here. At Mario Badescu . Ironic even, if you knew me pre -internship. Fashion enthusiast with an insatiable lust for heels and handbags, and the tiniest bit of a beauty snob, yes – but skincare junkie? Hardly. My skincare regimen (I use the word “regimen” lightly, here) consisted of a generic cleanser and whatever I saw first in the beauty aisle of some ubiquitous drugstore. Clearly I was the picky type. One week into the internship, post -training, I have an impressive lineup of skincare products on display, all chosen and tailored to my skin type. And while they do look so lovely sitting atop my bathroom counter, I actually use them – religiously (!). Cleanse. Tone. Moisturize. Pat on the eye cream. Et cetera . Slather on the body lotion and hand cream. Indulge in a scrub or mask. A couple months ago it was a slap-dash-and-go kind of ordeal, where I hoped for the best (which was useless in any case). My skin was moody, but since being properly pampered, it’s house-trained. Behaved. It enjoys treats – a combination of the Almond Honey Non-Abrasive Scrub and Orange Tonic Mask . If it’s extra good it gets rewarded with a brand new lipstick. The brighter the better , I say. Summer 2011 is, after all, about the oranges and unabashed hot pinks. And why not? Good skin deserves all the attention it gets. And while I love every little bottle and tub, it’s guaranteed you won’t love my incessant rambling. So these are the Holy Grail of favorites: Almond & Honey Face Scrub . Looove. Maybe obsessed, but I’m trying not to sound like your cliche intern gushing about a company’s products. The name sounds divine, for one. Almond and honey? A delicious combination. The scent is scrumptious – very natural, none of that artificial fragrance business – decadent but not gourmand. In truth I haven’t paid attention to the results in my skin after its use; I pick it up purely for the scent, go figure. The texture is lovely though. Creamy, with bits of finely ground almonds and cornmeal that gently exfoliate the skin. Even if it was grainy and sandpaper-like you wouldn’t notice – that scent is too good. Herbal Hydrating Serum . I’ve written about this before , so there’s no need to redo and rehash what’s been said and risk sounding like a broken record. Long story short: it’s dewiness in a bottle. And the perfect kick of hydration when my combo/oily skin says moisturizer is too heavy on hot summer days. Vitamin C Serum . It makes yet another appearance on this blog for a good reason. Another obsession of mine that will undoubtedly be a repurchased item (if I haven’t swayed you yet, Julia Restoin-Roitfeld uses it…). I neither know nor will pretend to understand the science portion of how it works (hence why I’m a journalism major), but will tell you this: miracle in a bottle for beautiful skin. On the pricier end of Mario Badescu products, but it’s worth the investment. Trust me. Super Rich Olive Body Lotion . Don’t let the name deter you from the lotion – it’s rich without a doubt, but nothing close to greasy. Apparently it’s one of our most popular products – and as much as I despise being a groupie for that so-called “it” product, it’s well-loved because it’s good . I have quite dry skin and have long been on the hunt for something deeply moisturizing, but also absorbs quickly so I could get dressed minutes later and head out the door without leaving lotion-residue on everything I come in contact with. It does exactly that. Period. (I’m Kim, by the way. ) . . . What are your holy grail products?

Because of its lightweight easily-absorbed texture, Sweet Almond Oil is able to penetrate deeply into the skin to deliver immediate, skin-softening benefits.

What do we think makes the Olympics so appealing for so many of us?

And you know what? We are!

To save your skin from both harsh clorine and natural salt water, try our Protective Cream For Swimming. (We also have a cream to save your skin while skiing.) Sun Protection I think we can all rightfully doubt that ancient Olympians bothered to use sunscreen during competition; what’s of no question is just how important it is to slather on some sunblock before outdoor activity.

Freshening Up, Greek-Style For thousands of years, people have placed a high value on rosewater for its many nourishing properties. The Ancient Greeks, in fact, valued their rose gardens as highly as they did their fruit orchards and fields of wheat.

It’s also a fantastic way to get glowing, beautiful skin. It’s exercise! I think we can all agree that exercise is a crucial part of a healthy, balanced lifestyle. Not only is it great for keeping your body fit, but it also boosts circulation and promotes a luminous glow in the skin. What could be more amazing?! On the flipside, sweat is the perfect breeding ground for bacteria… and bacteria can lead to acne breakouts. This explains why you might experience more body acne after starting a more intense workout regimen OR when you’ve worn non-breathable fabric. The key to preventing the acne-and-exercise cycle is to properly cleanse the skin immediately after exercising. A quick splash of water won’t cut it. Make sure you choose a cleanser, toner, and moisturizer that are right for your skin type: Dry Skin Orange Cleansing Soap , Glycolic Acid Toner , and Hydrating Moisturizer with Biocare & Hyaluronic Acid Oily Skin Botanical Facial Gel , Special Cucumber Cleansing Lotion and Oil-Free Moisturizer Combination/Oily Skin Enzyme Cleansing Gel , Cucumber Cleansing Lotion , and A.H.A. & Ceramide Moisturizer Combination/Dry Skin Seaweed Cleansing Soap , Seaweed Cleansing Lotion , and Honey Moisturizer Sensitive Skin Cream Soap , Aloe Vera Toner , and Buttermilk Moisturizer If breakouts do strike, try the following spot treatments according to each specific blemish type: Whiteheads Drying Lotion Blackheads Silver Powder Cystic Acne Buffering Lotion Other Pimples Drying Cream If you are already prone to breaking out, apply our Flower & Tonic Mask once or twice a week to help detoxify your skin.

No worries – head on over, here , here and here . What does sensitive skin look like? Again, physical traits will vary from individual to individual. But typical of sensitive skin is waking up blotchy and red in areas, sometimes dry and feeling tight. Small bumps may appear on the skin in patches. Skin will react easily and quickly to externalities: weather, seasonal or climate changes, abrasive fabrics/surfaces and products in contact with or applied onto the face. So how do I work with sensitive skin? Because sensitivity varies, and reasons behind sensitivity – such as having a certain skin condition like Rosacea or Psoriasis – are crucial in determining what products you should and should not use, it is in your best interest to consult a dermatologist if you feel that you may have a skin condition such as Rosacea, Eczema, Psoriasis, etc. Setting up an appointment with a skincare specialist will be incredibly helpful as well. Do be gentle with your skin: never rub, scrub or pick at spots. Look for products with ingredients such as Azulene, Balsam Peru, Keratoplast, Chamomile and Aloe because of their soothing properties.

Your hair. Just like skin, your hair suffers dehydration, breakage and frustrating tangles from all that cold, windy weather. And, just like your skin, it deserves a bit more love and care to keep it at its healthiest state. Our favorite winter combo? The ultimate trio: Lecithin Nourishing Shampoo , Hair Rinsing Conditioner and Nucleic Moisturizing Hair Rinse . . . . Step 1: It all begins with the right shampoo. Start from the beginning – the roots – both literally and figuratively. Healthy hair starts with healthy you and a good shampoo. We love the Lecithin Nourishing Shampoo because it’s rich in jojoba oil – an amazing ingredient (and key!) for daily use for dry hair types, or a few times a week come wintertime for anyone else. Step 2: Be generous with the conditioner. Apply a liberal amount and massage it through the ends, working upwards. Let your hair soak in the product for about one minute to help eliminate dryness and restore shine before thoroughly rinsing for soft, tangle-free locks. Step 3: Protect, protect, protect! Follow with our Nucleic Moisturizing Hair Rinse which doubles as a supplemental conditioner or leave-in treatment. It’s the ultimate product for restoring moisture and body, acting as a protectant and detangler all-in-one. Rinse it out, or leave it in – and bring it on the go if your hair feels a little frazzled during the course of the day. . . . It’s that simple. A few extra steps, and hellooo , beautiful hair.

The first time I used the Hair Rinsing Conditioner , I was completely caught by surprise. It is so incredibly lightweight that you’d never imagine how soft and hydrated it can make your hair. Running it through my hair I thought that, at best, it would help me detangle. It did so much more than that. It makes my hair shiny, soft, clean, and bouncy, in a way that heavier conditioners have never been able to. It’s recommended for use on fine, oily hair, although my hair is a bit thicker (and drier), and, if I’m being honest, I haven’t found anything else that works as well. While it’s a universal product, our Hair Rinsing Conditioner has been called a godsend for fine, oily hair . Forget the woes that come with overwhelmingly rich formulations that leave hair feeling matted and greasy.

You might even have to cover up the redness with some foundation, and sometimes the irritation turns bumpy. First of all, to avoid redness after waxing, make sure that the person waxing your face is doing it properly: they should be holding the skin taut around the wax before pulling it off. This should make waxing less painful and less likely to cause irritation. If you’re interested in a post-wax treatment you can quickly do at home, we recommend a mask. Specifically, the Calma Mask , which is oil-free* but still very hydrating and calming. (*Note: The mask is not intended to be used around the eyes. The upper lip, sideburns, above the eyebrow, and anywhere else you wax your face are all fair game, though!) Here’s another way to calm skin after waxing: Use a compress soaked with Chamomile Cleansing Lotion for a minute or so before applying the mask. A dusting of Special Healing Powder after the mask is removed is also advisable for those of you who experience a lot of irritation.

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Lee Ann"],"url":"https://blog.mariobadescu.com/esthetician-2/","Text":["Here’s the very first thing they teach you in Esthetics training: You are not a dermatologist. What does this mean? Basically it means that Estheticians are not qualified to make diagnoses for medical conditions such as Rosacea or Psoriasis. Estheticians are also not able to prescribe medications. However, Estheticians can (and regularly do ) make a major difference in their’s clients’ skin. By performing facials, recommending customized skin care regimens, and ensuring that you’re doing everything in your power to reveal your skin at it’s most beautiful, Estheticians play an important role in the appearance of skin. Estheticians can even make an impact on their client’s health in some cases. For example, your Esthetician will be sure to double-check that you’re wearing some sort of sun protection every day. Having an esthetician take charge of your waxing and other forms of hair removal is a wise idea as well- improper hair removal from certain areas can be dangerous. Both a dermatologist and an esthetician are skin care specialists who sport fancy white lab coats, but what exactly is the difference between the two? Continue reading to get a quick snapshot of what specifically distinguishes a dermatologist from an esthetician. Dermatologist · Is a medical doctor · Can diagnose and treat skin conditions and disorders including skin cancer · Can prescribe oral or topical medications · Can perform surgeries on skin abnormalities Visit a Dermatologist when you’re due for a full-body scan (to check for skin cancer and other abnormalities). You’ll also want to see a dermatologist if you have (or suspect you have) a skin disease such as Eczema. In some cases, severe acne can only be treated properly by a dermatologist. Esthetician · Performs facials, body wraps, waxing and makeup application · Conduct skin analyses · Recommends a complete at-home regimen for the client Visit an Esthetician to maintain beautiful skin with regular facials and for help in choosing the right skin care products for your skin. Your Esthetician will also show you the proper way to use your skin care regimen. Other things an Esthetician can do for you: Hair removal, eyebrow shaping, body treatments, etc. The general difference between a dermatologist and an esthetician is that the experience with a dermatologist is typically clinical whereas the experience with estheticians can be luxurious .

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Subtitle":["Hand with vitiligo skin condition"],"Title":["Understanding Hypopigmentation"],"url":"http://blog.mariobadescu.com/understanding-hypopigmentation/","Text":["We’ve spoken a lot about Hyperpigmentation on this blog. After all, most (if not all) of us have some type of skin discoloration, whether it’s in the form of acne marks , age spots, or sun damage. [Read: What is Hyperpigmentation? How can it be prevented? ] But what about Hypopigmentation ? On a basic level, Hypopigmentation is described as a loss of skin color. While Hyperpigmentation is caused by an increase in melanin (the substance that gives our skin and hair its color) Hypopigmentation is the result of a reduction in melanin production . Most of us have experienced Hypopigmentation as a result of trauma (a cut or burn) or sun damage (those white spots you see on your skin). There are certain types of Hypopigmentation which require the attention of a dermatologist or other health professional. These include Vitiligo ; Albinism ; and Tinea Versicolo r (fungal infection). More commonly , Hypopigmentation is caused by some trauma—a blister or a burn—that may affect the area with a loss of pigment and cause white spots on the skin. It’s important to ensure that such areas of Hypopigmentation are well protected from the sun; lack of melanin makes the skin far more vulnerable to sun damage. These white spots tend to be temporary; eventually the skin will heal and return to its usual color once the body regenerates pigment. [Read: Do you have these little white bumps around your eyes? ] While we normally associated sun damage with Hyperpigmentation, excess UV exposure can also cause a loss of color in the skin. Areas of sun damage-induced Hypopigmentation (white spots and areas of de-pigmented skin) usually occur alongside sun spots and are irreversible. The lesson here? In order to prevent both Hyper- and Hypopigmentation, it’s essential to protect the skin from the sun on a daily basis.

We’ve passed the obligatory Valentine’s Day landmark, which was more than likely to have been celebrated with one too many chocolate truffles and all things iced red and pink. Should we bother with asking just how you all are doing with your respective New Year’s Resolutions for 2012? Get off the scale. Eat that one extra chocolate without regret. Do it! Guilty pleasures aren’t sweet for nothing; savor it, enjoy it. Focus on what makes you feel good . For starters? Start toning . Toning . It’s essential in the cleansing process, body, mind and soul. We’re talking complexions: toners remove any residual dirt, oil and makeup from the surface of your skin for a truly clean cleanse . If it’s one thing you add on or carry on into the new year, it’s toning. 2012 means a new beginning: start fresh . Literally. Take the Alpha-Grapefruit Cleansing Lotion , for instance. It’s the perfect alcohol-free toner for combination skin that needs a little extra help in texture or the discoloration department. Lemon and grapefruit extracts exfoliate their way for a smoother, brighter, better you! For an extra bit of cooling, soothing and disinfecting oomph , we say have a fling with our Cucumber Cleansing Lotion . (After all, you never know what it could lead to – it could be love at first cotton ball.) It’s another one of those instant refreshers ideal for combination/oily skin whose T-zone needs a bit of shine control. Let the cucumber extract calm and revive dull skin. Purify those pores!

First thing, first. Do you check your bags when you travel? Or do you do whatever you can to squeeze everything into your TSA compliant carry-on? C’mon, be honest. This is a #judgementfreezone. I think the way you answer these questions is key to knowing what kind of traveler you are. Truth be told, I’ve been in both camps at different points in life. As I’ve settled into what I like to call “official” adulthood, my bags are checked when I travel. I’ll take being able to stroll through the airport unencumbered over being able to make a bee-line from the plane to a taxi any day. And guess what I’ll also take? My skin care products. Yes, that’s right. All of my full-sized, over 3.5-ounce bottles of beauty magic that I use every day to make me feel . . .well , like me. No edits. I take it all. Here are the products that are keeping my combination, oily, acne-prone skin happy and balanced on this trip to the City of Angels: Oh, are you in a rush? I have to go to baggage claim. I’ll catch a cab and meet you at the hotel. Seaweed Cleansing Soap – I’ve used this creamy cleanser on and off for years. Going from NYC to the sunshine of the west coast bookended by two cross country flights is the perfect storm for throwing my skin off balance. Since taking care of my temperamental complexion can be a bit like walking a tight rope—lean too far left, falter, jerk to the right—this is the wash I reach for when I’m at risk for becoming dehydrated (That recycled cabin air gets me every time.) Besides, this cleanser’s fresh, salty scent makes this Brooklyn girl feel just a teeny bit Pacific Coast cool. Special Cucumber Lotion – There’s nothing like a refreshing swipe of toner to whisk away any post-cleanse traces of ick and help keep skin clear. This is another all-time favorite, and the product that I go through the quickest. I wish I could tell you how many bottles I’ve emptied over the years. Botanical Exfoliating Scrub – I’m taking a vacation from scarves and gloves but there are no breaks from my exfoliation routine. Three times a week, I turn to this perfect combination of Coconut, Ginger, and Gingko Extracts with finely ground Ecuadorian Palm Ivory Seeds for insta-smooth skin. Rose Hips Mask – When travel, time difference, and work start to take their toll, I take a break and play hotel room spa with my favorite gentle, rejuvenating mask. Lip Wax – I slip a pot of this Rose-infused Lip Wax into every bag and pocket I have. In addition to being my go-to lip smoother, this tiny skin softener is the best quick fix for ragged cuticles and other dry bits. Do you travel light, or overpack?

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Subtitle":["facial cleanser"],"Title":["5 Facts About Cleansing"],"url":"https://blog.mariobadescu.com/facial-cleanser/","Text":["Cleansing —it should be the easiest part of your routine, right? Make sure you’re doing it correctly! Use Lukewarm Or Tepid Water Extreme temperatures of water when washing the face can be harsh on the skin and can potentially damage capillaries. Instead, opt for tepid or lukewarm water. Be sure to rinse thoroughly. Avoid Body Bar Soaps Sure, bar soaps for the body can make you feel squeaky clean, but they are not (I repeat) not formulated for your face. They are meant for the body and if they are used on your facial skin, a bar soap can strip the skin of its natural oils, leaving it tight, dry, and dehydrated. The skin on the body is different from facial skin—thicker and more resilient and can therefore handle bar soaps. Our facial skin, on the other hand, necessitates a gentler cleanser that is specifically formulated for the face. Choose The Right Facial Cleanser It is important to know your skin type so you can choose the right cleanser accordingly; cleansers are not a one-size-fits-all deal. Typically, oily and combination/oily skin types require a gel cleanser or foam-based cleanser whereas dry or combination/dry skin types need cream-based textures . What cleanser are you using? Cleanse Twice A Day The general rule of thumb for cleansing is twice a day, morning and night. Once a day may not be enough and anything more than twice a day is over-washing, which can strip the skin and potentially damage the protective moisture barrier. Makeup wearers especially need to cleanse at night to thoroughly remove makeup. Perhaps you don’t see the need to do a morning cleanse since you already washed the night before—but an a.m. cleanse is just as important and here’s why: your skin is in repairing itself at night while you sleep and that process includes the skin secreting oils and toxins; it’s best to start your day off with a clean slate…literally! So wash your face both morning and night. Use Circular Motions When Cleansing It is best to massage cleanser into your skin in circular motions as this action will help aid in properly removing makeup, dirt, oil, and impurities. Cleansing is a staple in your regimen, so do it right!

Kaolin"],"url":"http://blog.mariobadescu.com/kaolin/","Text":["Kaolin absorbs both water and oil, allowing it to soak up both excess oil and sweat. While it adheres well to the surface of the skin, it is also not difficult to remove. Best of all, it is non-comedogenic, which means that it works without clogging the pores. Fun Fact: Kaolin gets its name from Gaoling (Kao-Ling), a hill in the Chinese province Jingdezhen, Jainxi where it is mined. We’ve included Kaolin in many of our masks.

The goal of the blog is to deliver “Fresh & Fun Style Advice.” She also writes her own blog, BeRealLuxe.com , focused on luxury for less and luxury worth the splurge. 1. How would you describe your skin type? Oily/combination. 2. What is the best skin care advice anyone ever gave you? To wear sunscreen, avoid smoking and avoid the sun during peak hours (from 12 noon to 3 p.m.) 3. In your opinion, what is the single most important thing you can do for your skin? Wear sunscreen daily. 4. What is your personal skin care routine like? I wash my face twice daily, followed by toner and moisturizer—using Mario Badescu products formulated for oily/combo skin, I wear sunscreen and try and do a mask at least once a week. 5. What is your first skin care memory? My mom steaming her face, applying a mask and putting sliced cucumbers over her eyes. It made me think you can create a spa experience at home. Later on, my sister was a makeup artist at Dior and got me using undereye cream at age 13! . . . We can’t thank Kristin enough for the great interview!

Cleanse Start off by washing your face with our Seaweed Cleansing Soap . It’s a cream-based cleanser that will thoroughly cleanse the skin without overdrying it. (TIP: The best fall skin care practices start with a reassessment of your regimen; is the cleanser that worked so well in the heat and humidity of summer the right choice for your skin now?) 2. Exfoliate Slough away dead surface cells with our Almond & Honey Face Scrub . Apply in gentle, circular motions for about 30 seconds and rinse with lukewarm water. 3. Mask Apply a fairly thick layer of the Rose Hips Mask all over your face, avoiding the eye area and leave on for approximately 20 minutes, then rinse off with tepid water. 4. Steam Soften your pores and help deep clean them by boiling a pot of water, turn off the heat and lean over the pot at a safe distance for about three minutes. 5. Tone With a cotton ball or pad, swipe our Alpha-Grapefruit Cleansing Lotion on your face and neck. 6. Treat Put two to three drops of the Cellufirm Drops all over your face, neck and even the eye area for some soothing, anti-aging nourishment. 7. Moisturize Apply the Honey Moisturizer on your face and neck. 8. Eye Cream With your ring finger, apply a small amount of the Ceramide Herbal Eye Cream or the Hyaluronic Eye Cream on the orbital bone (the area of the face that lies between the highest part of the cheekbone and the under-eye area).

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Nicole Darmanin"],"url":"http://blog.mariobadescu.com/nylon-magazine-interview-with-dani-stahl/","Text":["Dani Stahl may quite possibly be the busiest girl in NYC. She’s the Style Editor-at-Large for NYLON Magazine , designs jewelry for Lia Sophia’s Red Carpet Collection, is the style expert on E!’s hit show Scouted! , and her social calendar? Well, let’s just say her dance card is always full. What you might not know about Dani is that she is way dedicated to her regimen of skin care treatments, and has been a regular at the Mario Badescu Skin Care Salon for years. Let’s put it this way, if the Mario Badescu Skin Care Salon was a sitcom, Dani would be the beloved guest star that gets the big applause every time she effervescently breezes through the door. I recently had the chance to chat skin and style with Dani. Here’s what she said: . . . N: You were a client at Mario Badescu before I even started working here… D: I grew up in the city, so that’s where you get a facial. When I got into fashion it was always a constant. I would say about 10, 12 years ago I really, really started to use the products. It’s a constant staple in any routine I have going. N: You are very dedicated and committed to your skin. What works for you? Which products and services make a difference? D: One thing that I use endlessly and always is the Vitamin C Serum . My basic regime is the Glycolic Acid Toner , Vitamin C Serum, Hyaluronic or Glycolic Eye Cream . And then I love the Cellufirm [Drops] and the Hylauronic [Emulsion] w/ Vitamin C . I like anything Vitamin C. I like healing and repairing. I often use the Buttermilk [Moisturizer] . If I have a little breakout I love the Anti-Acne Serum . I Love the Herbal Hydrating Serum . If it’s really dry in winter I like the Seaweed Night Cream . For a cleanser I like the Enzyme Cleansing Gel . I also like the Seaweed Cleansing Lotion , I like the Glycolic Cleanser too. I really love the Enzyme [Revitalizing] Mask . I like the Healing [and Soothing] Mask ; the Tightening Mask is good if you have an event. N: How about services? D: I can’t plug Irina [Dani’s aesthetician] enough, she is the ultimate service. Getting facials regularly is key. You have to keep it clean and fresh. The beauty of the services is that they [the aestheticians] will tell you what you need. What I discovered and got so many of my friends to do are the oxygen facials. You can think of it as “event face” like oh I’m going to a party or whatever it is I’m going to get this done and look great for a few days . If you do a series of them for six weeks diligently, once a week, it will affect your skin and really make a difference. I did it like a doctor’s appointment, to the T, 10 am on Tuesdays every week for 6 weeks. I couldn’t go anywhere without people asking what I was doing to my skin. I can’t recommend that enough. It’s all about consistency. You can’t do it just once, there’s no quick fix really. N: Tell me, since you are a beauty girl, well fashion girl, but I know that secretly inside you are a beauty girl… D: (Interjects) I am a beauty girl, on another planet I would have been a beauty editor. Really. N: If you weren’t working in fashion what would you do? D: I really can’t imagine not working in fashion. I will say this, I feel like beauty is fashion. I feel like it’s very intertwined. They go hand and hand. You know what I mean? What would I do without fashion? Oh, I’d be lost. I can’t imagine being without fashion. N: When I was a kid my grandmother had these metal tubes of lipstick in her vanity and I would always peek at them and try them on, and my mother always had a bottle of L’Air du Temps on her dresser. I remember the glass bottle with the birds on top. Those are my earliest beauty memories. What do you remember from when you were little, what were your first beauty impressions? D: I also remember my grandmother’s vanity. It was all mirrored, it had all of her makeup very organized. I was never allowed to touch it and my grandmother would meticulously apply her makeup for what seemed like hours. Even her hair, it used to be a joke that my grandfather couldn’t touch her hair. And you know my mom is very much my grandmother and I’m very much my mom just in updated versions. That vanity on Friday nights is the first thing that I think of. N: I think a lot of people are intimidated by fashion and get stuck in a rut. If someone is stuck and they don’t know how to get out, what is one thing that they can do? I think one thing that is always easy is to experiment with is color. My thing is always that fashion is fun. It’s not a life commitment; you can put it on, you can take it off. I think an easy place to start is to add a pop of color. Often people fear color. I think it’s a really easy way to break out a little bit. Also, I’m a walking accessory. Literally, accessories are just an amazing way to liven up your wardrobe. If you put on a great necklace or a statement bracelet or something, you’ve already jazzed up your whole look. Accessories are a great thing to experiment with. Accessories and color. It’s easily accessible; you probably already have it. N: How do you define your personal style? D: Eclectic. I always thought that I needed to define my look. Am I Uptown? Am I Downtown? But you don’t, again, fashion is fun. Fashion is about self expression: it can express the mood you are in for the day. I find all different things exciting. N: You’re a New York girl, I’m a New York girl, MB is a New York brand. What’s one of your favorite New York places that maybe the average person wouldn’t think of? D: Ummm Barney’s?! (We both laugh.) What is my favorite New York spot? My go-to answer is always Central Park, I don’t think that there are many days that go by that I don’t go to Central Park at some point, even in winter, that’s the New York getaway. . . .

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Jill"],"url":"http://blog.mariobadescu.com/mothers-day-2/","Text":["Me and Mom, circa 1980 When I was growing up in the 80s I thought my parents were movie stars. To be fair, they were impossibly glamorous. My father wore beautifully tailored suits and my mother had amazing hair in a decade when perms were taken seriously . Her clothes were so on point that I’m ashamed to say I didn’t save any of them (I would most definitely be wearing them now!). Aside from the hair and incredible clothes, my mother was beautiful. Like, Keira Knightley in a perfume-ad beautiful. What’s funny is that I never learned a single thing from her about proper skin care. My mother slept in her makeup, never shaped her eyebrows, and knew absolutely nothing about the importance of moisturizers , serums , and eye creams until fairly recently. [Mom’s recommendation: The Peptide Renewal Serum ] I realize now that my mother’s beauty trick was a combination of great facial structure, confidence, and youth . She was married at 18 and became a mother at 20. By the time my sister and I reached our teen years, my mother was only in her early-to-mid 30s; the age that I am right now. Thirty-something years later… My mom definitely taught me a lot about beauty. For one thing, she never paid attention to details. She never scrutinized her face in a magnifying mirror, and certainly didn’t spend a lot of time putting on makeup or perfecting her awesome 80s hair. She just pulled her hair out of curlers, applied her glamorous makeup in flash, and was ready to go. Her beauty was based on a type of confidence that simply can’t be achieved if you’re constantly picking yourself apart and inspecting yourself for flaws. “I feel sorry for girls today,” she tells me. “We never worried about being perfect when we were your age.” And she wasn’t perfect. And she was and is amazing. Happy Mother’s Day! Related posts: Honoring Mom On Mother’s Day Every mother deserves to feel beautiful! . . . It’s May, the month of sunshine, flowers and Mother’s...

The ancient Romans conquered half the known world and build the Coliseum. They’re also sometimes credited with inventing lipstick. In fact, it’s their attention to beauty and esthetics that interests us most, mainly because ancient Rome’s advancements in the treatment of acne are still widely used today. Instances of acne have been documented across cultures, through continents, and around the globe. Affecting men, women, and children (and sometimes babies ) it can be triggered by a combination of stress, hormones, and other factors. It’s no surprise that about a half-billion people in America alone suffer from pimples, blackheads, whiteheads, and cystic blemishes. For an effective acne treatment, it has been said that the people of Rome bathed in warm mineral and sulfur-infused baths. Located in water-rich lands, the Romans focus on bathing with soaps and cleansing was common practice. Colloidal S ul fur , a pure and natural mineral, helps to unclog pores and clear up acne. While the Romans paid impeccable attention to cleanliness, often turning to natural ingredients like eggs, seeds, juice, horns, honey, and plants, it’s their use of sulfur that has held true and continued to help acne sufferers to this day. The following steps will help those suffering from acne keep their skin clean and cared for: Cleanse daily , once in the morning and once in the evening. Use toner to help with excessive oil and breakouts. Apply moisturizer after toning. Keep your skin protected with sunscreen. Spot treat breakouts , rather than picking at your skin. Throughout history, one thing remains the same: beauty solutions always come back to Mother Nature. As an abundant source of plants rich in vitamins, minerals, lipids, and antioxidants, it’s no wonder the beauty industry has shifted its focus to encourage a more natural way to solve many of our skin care problems. They say everything has to come full circle; the Romans would be proud. What are some of your favorite natural skin care ingredients? Have you ever used any of the above to pamper your skin?

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by admin"],"url":"http://blog.mariobadescu.com/5-skincare-questions-hope-schmid/","Text":["Hope DeAngelis Schmid is co-founder of the popular women’s travel and beauty blog, The Jet Set Girls . She also writes for The DC Ladies , Brilliant Color and Beauty Today , and Daily Makeover among others. Hope is always on the lookout for the best new beauty products and enjoys sharing her finds and flops with her readers. . . . 1. How would you describe your skin type? I have classic combination skin and even though I’m in my 30’s, I’m prone to the occasional breakout. I have a couple of Mario Badescu products on my bathroom counter for just those occasions: the anti-acne serum for an area like my chin that’s inflammed, and the drying lotion to address particular spots. 2. What is the best skin care advice anyone ever gave you? Diagnose the reason for your acne flare ups and treat accordingly. For instance, if you break out a couple of days after Halloween, realize it’s diet related, throw out the rest of your candy stash, and continue with your regular skin care regimen. If it’s hormonal, consider treating specific areas and drink more water. If your skin is broken out but dry, you may be over-treating your skin, drying out the top layers and causing your body to produce more oil to heal itself and in turn making matters worse. In this case you would want to pull back on harsh products and give your skin a “naked” night to rest. 3. In your opinion, what is the single most important thing you can do for your skin? My aunt and uncle who are dermatologists have been telling me forever to wear sunscreen. Somehow, that transferred to my face cream early on; but I can’t resist having tan legs. By the end of the summer I have a big moon pie face and tan limbs. Thank God for bronzer. 4. What is your personal skin care routine like? My best intentions are to wash each morning and night, use a quality eye cream, and either an anti-aging cream or a salicylic acid product depending on the condition of my skin. Finish with an SPF and tinted moisturizer. 5. What is your first skin care memory? My first mask was a bargain from the drugstore; but I loved how it peeled off. I was hooked on beauty treatments after that! . . . We can’t thank Hope enough for this great interview! Don’t forget to check her out on Twitter at @JSGHope – and of course, at The Jet Set Girls .

One day, a fellow esthetician here was gushing about how the Glycolic Acid Toner imparted a glow to her skin. I’m one of those people that will eat or drink anything that will make my skin radiate or turn back the hands of time. I would literally fly myself to the jungles of the Amazon if I knew a miracle fruit germinated there. You get the picture. So when my esthetician friend raved about the Glycolic Acid Toner, I literally had dreams about it thereafter and I couldn’t stop thinking about it. I finally succumbed to trying it and fell in love at first swipe. I felt the tingle on my skin and I knew right then and there that the Glycolic Acid was working . The Glycolic Acid Toner is formulated with 2% Glycolic Acid and Grapefruit Extract.

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Jill"],"url":"http://blog.mariobadescu.com/skin-care-101-five-common-skin-questions-answered/","Text":["What is this strange discoloration on my face? Have you ever gone to the beach or pool and then noticed—hours later—that your skin has odd dark patches? This affects women in particular due to pregnancy, birth control pills, or other hormonal issues, and can be very distressing. For others—both men and women—sun spots begin to crop up sometime in the thirties, an unpleasant reminder of tanning years past. Remember to protect your skin from the sun at all times and, if the damage is already done, use a whitening mask to help brighten up and minimize sun-related discoloration. What’s the best way to exfoliate if I have acne? You probably already know that exfoliation is super-important, right? But knowing the best type of exfoliation for your skin is even more crucial. When it comes to exfoliation, lay off of scrubs if you have inflamed acne, and try a product with Glycolic Acid instead! (P.S. You can tweet this skin care tip by clicking on it! ) I have oily skin. Do I really need to moisturize? We talk about this a lot and for good reason: oily skin really does need moisturizer. Did you know? The very best way to combat oily skin is to moisturize! Without moisturizer, the skin produces even more oil, leading to more shine and, for some, more acne. Remember: people with oily skin need oil-free, light moisturizers that hydrate without being greasy. ( Tweet this tip !) Seriously, what is a serum ? I get this question all the time. Here’s the answer: Serums are special because they are formulated with smaller molecules of concentrated ingredients—which makes it possible for them to penetrate the skin deeper and deliver more active ingredie nts than other skincare products . When we use these at night (when the skin is hard at work repairing itself), It’s possible to get the full benefit of the serum. (Tweet) Why is my skin still dry? I’m always moisturizing! There are two answers to this question, and I’m willing to bet that every dry gal or guy falls into one of two categories. The first: If you’re not exfoliating, there’s no way for moisturizer to penetrate through layers of dead skin cells and be effective. The second: You’re using the wrong moisturizer for your skin type. Do you know your skin type? Discover it here, using this online skin analysis.

I’ve been in quite a few weddings. Over the years I’ve gotten necklaces, a shawl, flip-flops (a smart choice for bridesmaids who like to dance!), and a tote bag. While not 100% necessary, bridesmaid gifts are a sweet way to thank your girls for standing beside you on your big day. What would I give as a bridesmaid gift ? Skin care of course! In particular, I would most definitely arm them with the Drying Lotion (in case of last-minute acne breakouts). I might even make up a little basket of treasures , customizing (of course) for each girl.

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Sara Kosmyna"],"url":"http://blog.mariobadescu.com/beauty-secrets/","Text":["When you have a job in skincare, you learn a lot about beauty. Working with a team of smart and naturally beautiful women with backgrounds in everything from cosmetology and retail to marketing, business and makeup, there’s no shortage of tips to go around—and if there’s one thing we all have in common, it’s our appreciation of beauty! Without further ado, the ladies of Mario Badescu Skin Care share their best skincare tips and trade secrets: Part One! Name: Sara Age Range: 25-30 Skin Type: Combination/Oily What is your number one skincare tip? I have many, but if I had to choose one, I’d say cleanse and moisturize every day. For daytime moisturizing, use sunscreen. When I was younger, I thought tanning was cool, but the hyperpigmentation (sun damage) it leaves behind isn’t! The sun is the number one cause of premature aging and smart skincare will keep you looking your very best for years to come. Which Mario Badescu product can’t you live without? I’m all about antioxidants, so our Vitamin C Serum makes my top pick! It goes on smooth and there’s nothing better than antioxidants to fight against free radical damage. How many skincare products do you think you own? Imagine, for a moment, a skincare cabinet overflowing with products. Now, triple that . Some people take in stray animals; I take in stray beauty products! Jars, bottles and tubes live in my purse, car, near my bedside, in the kitchen and on my work desk. When I say that I’m beauty obsessed, I’m not kidding. Tell us about your skincare-related habits. I always avoid pulling and tugging my skin—especially around my neck and décolletage, since those are two of the first places to show signs of aging. What’s your biggest skincare pet peeve? When I see someone being rough with their skin (i.e., scrubbing hard or applying products roughly around the eyes) I hurt inside and I ALWAYS tell them to stop. What has working for MB taught you about beauty/skincare/etc.? I’m not alone in my love affair with skincare! Working for Mario Badescu has shown me that there are a lot of people who care about their skin just as much as I do. Being a beauty writer for MB has also taught me a ton because I spend my days researching the best ways to care for skin. Name: Lee Ann Age Range: 25-30 Skin Type: Combo/Oily in Spring/Summer and Combo/Dry in Fall/Winter What is your number one skincare tip? My number one skin care tip is to KNOW your skin so you can use the right products. Which Mario Badescu product can’t you live without? I can’t live without the Seaweed Cleansing Soap . How many skincare products do you think you own? I own at a plethora of skin care products…literally. Too many to count. Tell us about your skincare-related habits. I am militant about sun protection. Because the sun is the number one cause of premature aging, I avoid it like like the plague. Ok, maybe I’m a little too extreme…LOL What’s your biggest skincare pet peeve? My biggest skin care pet peeve is when people think it’s okay to skip moisturizer because they’re afraid it will make their skin more oily or to allow their skin to ‘breathe.’ The opposite is true! What has working for MB taught you about beauty/skincare/etc.? Working for MB has taught me that all skin is unique and therefore needs unique skin care solutions. We take a customized approach to skin care here at MB. Name: Kimberly Age Range: 20-25 Skin Type: Combination/Oily What is your number one skincare tip? The simpler the better; less is more. Which Mario Badescu product can’t you live without? The Vitamin C Serum , which I’ve rambled on and on about. How many skincare products do you think you own? Eight, if we’re limiting it to just the face. (If it’s including body care, there’s a handful of creams and oils I always have on rotation.) Tell us about your skincare-related habits. I always exfoliate head to toe; no regimen is complete without it! What’s your biggest skincare pet peeve? Not washing your face before bed, regardless of whether or not you have makeup on. Cleansing twice daily is crucial if you want good skin! What has working for MB taught you about beauty/skincare/etc.? Let’s just say that before MB, I never moisturized . I’ve come a long way since.

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Kimberly Yang"],"url":"https://blog.mariobadescu.com/how-to-shave-2/","Text":["We borrow their button-ups and jeans (ok, fine – sometimes we keep them). Now we’re raiding their medicine cabinets too. Keep in mind that men’s grooming products are expertly designed for skin subject to daily shaving. Tools may be important, but the secret to a perfectly effortless shave is all in the skincare. Take it from the boys: it’s their jars of pre- and post-shave products that make the job (and end result!) so much smoother. Here’s how to shave without irritation: CONDITION . Prep every shave with our Pre-Shave Conditioner for a smoother, more comfortable shaving experience. A calming blend of Azulene and Lavender Extract helps soothe and soften, enabling the blade to glide across skin with minimal irritation. PREP . Get a close shave with our classic Shaving Cream , which features a rich, non-foaming consistency to further soften hair and skin. Or, give the Peppermint Shaving Cream a go: it’s a personal favorite given its unique hydrating and cooling properties. TREAT . Our lightweight Protein After Shave Lotion , to be used immediately following any shaving session, features Peppermint Extract to help cool and tone for a refreshing boost all while reducing irritations. (Dry skin types can skip this step; after shave tends to have a slight alcohol content for antiseptic benefits.) MOISTURIZE . You can use your favorite body lotion , of course, but I much prefer applying the After Shave Moisturizer post-shave. (Regular lotions are saved for non-shaving days.) It makes a huge difference in helping to soothe sensitivities skin—especially after you’ve shaven—while keeping skin soft and well-hydrated. This moisturizer was specifically formulated to help replenish lost moisture and deliver soothing Allantoin to help calm skin and prevent irritation. . . . Which ‘men’s’ products do YOU use?

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Lee Ann"],"url":"https://blog.mariobadescu.com/aging-gracefully/","Text":["We’ve all met someone who looks phenomenal for their age. What’s their secret? 10 secrets for aging gracefully: Sleep ‘Get your beauty sleep’ is not just some old adage to take lightly. Getting an adequate amount of sleep each night (7-8 hours at least) is conducive to looking rested, and a rested visage equates to a younger appearance. Sleep also gives the body the chance to fully repair, regenerate, and rebuild. Diet And yet another old adage rings true: ‘ you are what you eat. ’ What you put on the inside will certainly reflect on the outside. It is important to consume a balanced, nutritious diet that boasts of fruits, vegetables, and healthy fats (i.e., avocados, wild salmon) and drink plenty of water. Of course, check with your physician first before making any changes in your diet. Click here for some of the best foods for beautiful skin! Exercise An active lifestyle is a fantastic way to get glowing, radiant skin. Here’s why: exercise promotes blood circulation, which thereby encourages a healthy looking glow to the skin. Secondly, exercise releases endorphins in your brain, which contributes to an elevated mood. It’s a win win—a glowing complexion and mood booster is sure to amp up the anti-aging quotient. Exercise doesn’t need to be dreadful and boring either. If you’re not a treadmill person, try something fun like salsa dancing or biking on a picturesque mountain trail. Stay Positive As insignificant as it may seem, cultivating a joyful, positive attitude and surrounding yourself with positive, encouraging people enhances our spirit, which in turn, helps to keep us younger longer. Proper Skin Care Youthful looking skin is largely contingent on a proper skin care regimen that is catered for one’s skin type. Moreover, it is important to avoid certain practices that can sabotage your complexion such as smoking or not removing makeup before bedtime . To determine the best products for your skin, take our online skin analysis . (Check out what happened to this woman when she didn’t remove her makeup for bed for an entire month.) Avoid the Sun One of the top contributing factors to premature aging and wrinkling is sun exposure. It is best to avoid it as much as possible, and if you do bask in the sun, wear a hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen. Many people who are over 40 and wrinkle-free say that their secret to looking young is to “stay out of the sun!” Perhaps this seems too militant, but your skin will thank you. It’s all about prevention, prevention, prevention and it’s much easier than repairing, repairing, repairing. Invest in Anti-Aging Products In addition to proper skin care, it is beneficial to incorporate anti-aging products in your regimen to help promote a youthful looking complexion and to help slow down the formation of signs of aging (such as crow’s feet and fine lines). If anti-aging products are foreign to you, start off by using two items such as an eye cream and facial serum to get yourself acclimated. Be mindful that you must choose products in accordance with your skin type. For instance, oily skin does not require a super hydrating, rich night cream that was designed for dry skin. Get a Dog (or any furry pet) Although this is not a proven fact, studies show that having a pet—namely an animal with fur such as a dog, cat, or ferret—may lengthen your life span up to a whopping 10 years. Perform Selfless Acts Putting the needs of others before your own is highly rewarding because kind, selfless acts will enhance your life and give you a sense of purpose. This cannot help but feed your soul and keep you young longer. Philanthropic people testify that doing good deeds has given them fulfillment and longevity. Live Life to the Fullest You only live once, so live life to the fullest. Don’t deprive yourself of a piece of decadent chocolate cake now and then or a much-deserved vacation to your favorite spot. A life of moderation is more conducive to a longer lifespan as opposed to a life of deprivation . Be daring and do something a little risky such as bungee jumping or parasailing. An adventurous streak reinforces a younger spirit. Furthermore, try new things like an exotic dish or learn a new language. The sky is the limit. Age is just a number. Put these 10 tips into practice and age gracefully!

For a lot of people with body acne, the condition can be both physically uncomfortable and embarrassing. Let’s review some basic steps to clear up body acne. These tips may seem super-simple, but, when followed consistently, they’ll make a major difference in the severity and incidence of body acne. Here it is, STEP ONE : Take a look at the clothes you wear closest to your skin. Are they mostly made of synthetic fabrics that don’t ‘breathe’ well? Switch to cotton undershirts, pajamas and tops. STEP TWO : Try to take a shower after exercising. Sweat is the perfect breeding ground for the type of bacteria that is responsible for acne. STEP THREE : Think about what you’re washing your body with. You’ll want to avoid harsh, drying bar soaps and also steer clear of granular scrubs. Your body wash should, however, offer a chemical exfoliant such as an alpha hydroxy acid (AHA). Our AHA Botanical Body Soap is a good choice. STEP FOUR : Extend your skin care regimen past your face by using a mask twice a week (our Drying Mask would be ideal) as well as other acne treatment products. You can always use a Drying Lotion or Drying Cream to spot-treat acne breakouts on your body, as well as the Buffering Lotion (for Cystic body acne). Give these steps a try and tell us about your progress!

Plump skin is the goal here, but tight and itchy? Not so much. If your skin is in need of a boost in moisture and glow, add this recipe to your Friday night repertoire. Slip into your robe, have Spotify set at your favorite playlist, light a few candles – whatever suits your fancy, really – and treat you and your skin to a good drink. Make this a well-deserved R&R session if you’re staying in, and if you’re willing to brave the cold for an evening out on the town, let this be your prep for flawless makeup from application to finish. Bottom’s up! . . . You’ll Need: Hyaluronic Emulsion with Vitamin C Rose Hips Mask Seaweed Night Cream Ceramide Herbal Eye Cream The Breakdown: Every DIY facial starts with a clean complexion. Cleanse, exfoliate, tone with your trusty favorites – you know how the tune goes. (And if you don’t? We’ve got you covered – read up on our guide to DIY at-home facials !) Hydrate and brighten. Start by massaging a few drops of the Hyaluronic Emulsion with Vitamin C into the skin. Any skincare expert or bona fide junkie will rave on endlessly about the benefits of Hyaluronic Acid and Vitamin C. Add Collagen to the mix and you have yourself an incredibly nourishing, nutrient-rich serum that helps restore skin’s natural moisture, improve clarity , and brighten the skin. Bring back the dewy glow. Our Rose Hips Mask is a fall Mario Mask Must (can you say that three times fast?!). It’s perfect for sensitive or dull, tired skin in restoring moisture for a healthy, plump complexion . We’re all about antioxidant Vitamin C for its brightening properties – and this mask is chock full of it. You’ve got 20 minutes all to yourself. Are you singing along to Marvin Gaye or Barbara Streisand right now? We are. Do feel free to join us… Rinse well with warm water and follow with, once again, your favorite toner . Take a good look in the mirror – this step is indisputably the most important of them all – and admire your skin for a few moments. Soft, supple, plump, and with a dewy glow to boot. Are you headed out? Pat on your go-to moisturizer and start the second phase of the beautification process. Relish in the easy application and flawless finish – good skincare and beautiful makeup are inexplicably linked. (Remember that!) If you’re staying in, lock in all that moisture and glow with the Seaweed Night Cream . It’s the most versatile and lightweight of our creams in that it’s oil-free and therefore non-greasy. Seaweed, Collagen, and Hyaluronic Acid help keep your complexion nourished and hydrated all throughout the night. Don’t forget the eyes! Reduce the appearance of dry, tired under-eyes and help smooth the look of fine lines with the Ceramide Herbal Eye Cream . It’s one of our lighter options, making it a universal choice, but don’t hesitate to reach for something richer if you need it. What are your Friday night skincare rituals?

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by admin"],"url":"http://blog.mariobadescu.com/the-mostly-beauty-related-reasons-why-i-hate-summer/","Text":["I know I am in the minority because most of you just love the hot weather and to wear your teeny tiny little shorts and skirts and strappy sandals. Well I am very happy for you all. Really. Enjoy the far too many months of warm weather. You are the winners. In my opinion, there’s hardly a really cold month around here. While I am trying to reverse out of my parking spot on an icy hill I am not cursing or getting mad. I am loving the fact that there is ice on the ground and my apartment isn’t going to be 90 degrees when I get home. If I’m not on a beach vacation, I want it to be under 50 degrees. Here are my reasons: I have completed a gorgeous make-up application and look fa-bu-lous (at least that’s my perception and we should all think we look fabulous, always.) and the second I step away from the fan and into the hallway to wait for the elevator, I feel sweaty and gross within seconds. Not to mention the professional concealing work to cover any zits and scars is melting away by about 75 percent before I even get to the street. By the time I get where I am going and supposed to be looking fabulous, instead I will look like I need a shower again. Why do I even bother? The subway. There can not be a more miserable feeling than stepping down into the bowels of hell in mid August after it rains or at 4pm on the third day of a heat wave. All you peeps from outside the city (THE city- New York City, that is), take it from me. Unless of course you want the true middle-class New Yorker experience but I do not recommend it. Avoid the subway in the summer at all costs and take a taxi instead. Do your make-up when you get to your well air-conditioned destination. Or go without. Either way you ain’t looking good when you get there. Stay indoors unless absolutely necessary until about 9pm. That’s how I roll in summer – and also why I try to avoid Florida at all costs. It’s a bad hair day-month-season. Humidity stinks. Blow outs turn into afros in an hour and curly hair looks like the top of a Q-tip. 2 words. Pony tail. Having pedicures and waxing occupy far too much time in scheduling my days off and lunch breaks. It’s really nice to not have to have to worry about such major life issues such as well groomed toes and hairless body parts all winter. Second degree burns on my hands from touching the steering wheel or the CD’s in the car! Oh yeah and the exploding cases of soda in the trunk because I am too lazy to drag them around the block up into the apartment. Twisting up a tube of lipstick and it’s so melted it falls right out of the tube onto my clothes or on the floor. Just great. That’s $22 down the drain. How come that never happens with a $1.99 Wet N Wild lipstick? . . . All I can say is enjoy the rest of the summer. I wish I could. So until November I will be armed with my bottle of chilled Facial Spray with Aloe Herbs and Rosewater and douse myself repeatedly so I don’t get too cranky.

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Jill"],"url":"https://blog.mariobadescu.com/fine-lines/","Text":["A. Absolutely not! Whether you have a lot of sun damage, fine lines and wrinkles, or acne scarring, it’s never too late to make a serious difference in your skin. Here’s how: First, start using daily sun protection (if you aren’t already). This will make any existing skin conditions less visible. Exposing skin to the sun darkens age spots, acne scars, and sun spots. It also dries out the skin, making wrinkles and fine lines more noticeable. This moisturizer with broad spectrum sun protection is super-popular: Collagen Moisturizer SPF 15 . Vitamin C helps visibly brighten the skin. We’re obsessed with Vitamin C for a good reason—it works to help fade hyperpigmentation for a more even skin tone. The Vitamin C Serum is a must-have for age spots, sun spots, etc. Regular exfoliation will speed up skin cell turnover. Remember that, as we age, skin cells shed at a slower rate, causing the skin to appear older and dull. Incorporating exfoliation sheds these aging, dulling dead skin cells, thereby fighting skin wrinkling and hyperpigmentation. Our new Botanical Exfoliating Scrub uses finely ground seeds (crushed in a controlled process) to ensure overall even exfoliation while Coconut, Ginger, Ginkgo, Aloe, and Ginkgo nourish the skin. PEPTIDES. Oh how we love our Peptides. Here’s what you really need to know—Peptides work by signaling the skin to create new collagen. Collagen is the substance in the skin that keeps it firm and taut, and depletion of Collagen is what causes the skin to sag. More collagen = fewer fine lines and wrinkles, and more taut skin!

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Kimberly Yang"],"url":"http://blog.mariobadescu.com/menopause/","Text":["Peri-menopause, menopause , post-menopause, oh my ! Whether you’re just at the very beginning or well into it, change is a-comin’. It’s more than just losing your monthly cycle: it’s a whole-body change, and that means your skin is in for an overhaul. The first signs of menopause begin with the infamous hot flashes and menopausal flushing, then progress further with a whole host of symptoms. Redness and dryness are often hallmarks of menopause-induced change, but women have been known to experience a range of skin problems from dry, itchy skin and thin, rosacea-prone skin to oily skin or breakouts. The silver lining? You’re not alone. Every woman goes through the process – as will your male counterparts. (They just call it andropause .) [Read: 10 ways to age better ] It’s the hormonal shifts during menopause that wreak havoc on your skin. These are tough times – perhaps second only to the skin woes of puberty – and tough times call for… You guessed it . Good skincare. (And a glass of wine or cup of green tea . Whatever’s chock full of antioxidant flavonoids and suits your fancy.) Why It Happens: There are more estrogen receptors on the face than elsewhere on the body; thus, the impact of menopause on skin is magnified. Estrogen stimulates the formation of collagen, so as production begins to slow in your early 40s to late 50s, the formation of fine lines and wrinkles grow apparent as skin experiences dryness, itchiness, and a host of other issues. For others, the hormone imbalance temporarily kicks their oil production into high gear and leads to breakouts. This skin instability will eventually subside. Post-menopausal skin will return some form of normalcy, but do be aware that it usually becomes drier and more sensitive than your pre-menopause skin. What Happens: With estrogen levels lowering, your skin will experience… – Reduced collagen production. – Loss of elasticity. – Fine lines, wrinkles, sagging, and other visible signs of aging. – Thinning of skin. – Dryness, itchiness, and tightness. – Temporary flushing and/or rosacea-like symptoms. How to Prevent & Combat Menopausal Changes: You can’t prevent menopause from happening, period. What you can do, however, is prevent the severity of the skin problems that come before, during, and may remain permanently after menopause. For skin that looks fresh and youthful even during this crazy bout… – Wear sunscreen daily . Every day, 365 days a year, seven days a week, regardless of weather. Sun damage is the number one cause that attributes to and catalyzes the formation of fine lines, wrinkles, and age spots, so be sure to keep skin in tip-top condition by protecting it. – Exfoliate using AHAs. Alpha Hydroxy Acids like Glycolic Acid or any fresh fruit extracts are fantastic alternatives to your traditional, granular scrub. These chemical exfoliants are far gentler on sensitive , mature skin, but are just as effective in polishing away the surface to reveal a brighter, smoother, more youthful-looking complexion. Plus, exfoliating better preps the skin for absorption of any anti-aging product applied afterwards. – Moisturize well. Moisturizing is paramount for keeping menopausal skin hydrated and nourished, thus giving the skin a smoother, plumper appearance. It can also prevent or help soothe any itchiness or discomfort that comes with dry, flaky skin. – Establish and follow your anti-aging regimen religiously. Make sure product is rich with anti-aging and antioxidant ingredients such as Vitamin C, Peptides, Hyaluronic Acid, and Collagen. [We recommend: Vitamin C Serum and Peptide Renewal Serum ] – Drink plenty of water. Water is one of the easiest ways to ensure that your skin is well hydrated, instantly giving you a boost in your complexion. In addition, water helps reduce inflammation by flushing out any toxins from the body. – Stop taking hot showers. Hot water is incredibly harsh and drying on the skin and will inevitably exacerbate any dryness, flakiness, and itchy discomfort. Instead, stick to cool or lukewarm baths. [Read: How hot showers can destroy your skin ] – Be active. A little bit of cardiovascular activity keeps the blood pumping, which in turn, increases the amount of oxygen and nutrients that gets delivered to the skin. The result? A healthy flush of color and a little encouragement in collagen production, too.* – Eat healthily. Focus on an antioxidant-rich diet (especially with foods high in Vitamin C, an essential component for collagen synthesis) and essential fatty acids like omega-3. Found in fortified eggs and salmon, omega-3 fatty acids help produce the skin’s oil barrier which is crucial in keeping skin hydrated and looking youthful. It’s the lack of omega-3s that often leads to acne, dryness, and itchiness. *Always consult a doctor when making changes to your diet or fitness routine.

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Kimberly Yang"],"url":"https://blog.mariobadescu.com/what-to-pack/","Text":["Now that you know your vacation style (if you don’t, take our vacation style quiz !), it’s time to figure out what beauty essentials you need to pack for your next getaway. . . . If you’re Leisurely… You’re the cruise lover, spa frequenter and beach bum armed with a floppy hat, plush towel and summer novel du jour . You don’t over-pack; you simply prefer to be well prepared. Why pare down to the essentials when you can have it all? A little bit of glitz and glamour never hurt the soul – and what better time to indulge than when on vacation? Space isn’t an issue when you have the Rebecca Minkoff Perfect Tote slung with utmost je ne sais quoi over your shoulder. Magazines, hand cream , a glamorous pair of tortoise shell cat-eye sunglasses , a spare silk kaftan – you name it, you have it. What keeps it from turning into Mary Poppins’ bottomless carpet bag, however, is a little pouch in which you tuck away essentials like your Lip Wax SPF 15 , ID for beach-bumming coladas and pretty pennies. There’s nothing sweeter than a reminder to Stay Beautiful every time you pull out that purse. Getaway or not, you know that skincare is a necessity to keep your complexion in tip-top condition . You never leave without your Hyaluronic Eye Cream (it’s the ideal vacation eye cream that’s light enough for hot holidays, yet rich and lush enough for an effective hydrating treatment) and Oil-Free Moisturizer SPF 30 (it’s packed with antioxidant green tea to help protect your skin no matter where in the world you are). Since you want to look your best, the Super Collagen Mask always has a sound spot in your toiletries bag: it’s a luxurious treatment that refreshes, revives and helps tighten your complexion. Chances are you’re taking full advantage of this beachside or cruise ship getaway by wearing all the summer dresses and bikinis possible, so the decadent Raspberry Body Scrub , Apricot Super Rich Body Lotion and Summer Shine Body Lotion are your go-to combo for keeping skin soft and glow-y all week long. And because no vacation is complete without the extras, you’ll pack Armour Beauty Dreaming lipgloss for a non-fussy, daytime pick-me-up and Barracuda for a unapologetically glamorous evening pout. If you’re Adventurous… You constantly crave and thrive on the adrenaline rush that comes with trying something new. Camping, snorkeling, skiing, sailing, hiking – you name it, you’ll have done it (or plan on doing it). An adventure-packed vacation getaway means you’ll only have room – and time – for the essentials. The Seaweed Cleansing Soap is gentle enough for sensitive skin (or dry, aggravated skin from outdoor adventures) while Oil-Free Moisturizer SPF 30 helps keep skin hydrated. But for those whose getaways entail a little more extremities (whether it’s climate or the activities planned), the adventurous jet-setter needs a little extra punch in their vacation skincare regimen. The Ginseng Moist Cream keeps dry skin hydrated and balanced; the Protective Cream for Swimming helps protect against damaging chlorine or saltwater; and the Hydro-Emollient Cream helps hikers, mountain-climbers and frequent flyers alike from dehydrated skin. As for the rest of the body, the Formula 200 Body Lotion is ideal. It’s lightweight and non-greasy (meaning no interference with whatever hands-on activities you have lined up), but provides incredible, lasting hydration. Of course you’ll want to keep your hands free; that’s why the Rebecca Minkoff Craig camera bag is the perfect cross-body for either stashing the essentials (like your lip balm ) or for safely stowing your camera to document each adventure along the way. It’s equal parts utilitarian and functional as it is fashionable. If you’re Culturally-Immersed… Learning is your endgame: waking up in new places, exploring local treasures and immersing yourself in different cultures is your vision of the perfect vacation. Packing, then, requires a bit of research to find out what types of skincare products you’ll need in that new environment. It’s all about keeping true to the basics and leaving just enough room in your toiletries bag for any new, foreign goodies to try once you return home. The bronze Mini M.A.C. is every bit travel-chic as it is travel-friendly. It’s hands-free and just small enough for a lip balm , pen, mini Moleskine notebook and point-and-shoot. The antiqued gold leather is perfect wherever you are – it’s demure but just glamorous enough for Italy, and feels right with all the easy, breezy maxi dresses for Egypt. Tuck in an Armour Beauty gloss in a bright orange for nights out dancing. You never know where the next turn in the street could take you! You could easily get away with packing a toiletries bag that’s just as minimal as your Mini M.A.C. The AHA & Ceramide Moisturizer provides lightweight moisture for a healthy, radiant complexion when exploring the streets of Barcelona, and the Rose Hips Nourishing Oil feels gorgeous on the skin (and perfectly lush for days spent in Morocco). Keep a tiny bottle of our Rosewater Facial Spray on hand (or in the bag, rather) for an instant pick-me-up wherever you are, and a full-sized version in the hotel mini fridge for a refreshing end-of-the-day spritz. The luxe Raspberry Body Scrub makes for an incredible evening treat after a long day of exploration, and the Elbow & Heel Smoothing Cream helps restore tired, cracked feet after walking up and down cobblestone streets. Massage a generous amount of the Vitamin E Body Lotion and the light, sophisticated fragrance you’re left with will always remind you of your travels. . . .

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by admin"],"url":"http://blog.mariobadescu.com/its-almost-spring/","Text":["March is a weird month for the Northeast. It could snow one day or be 50 degrees another. I woke up this past Sunday morning smelling and hearing Spring from the open window. Somewhat the same way you can smell winter coming around the middle of September. Its just one of those things you can smell in the air and sense in your bones. I guess Mother Nature is a pretty smart lady. Two great things happen in March this year. We turn the clocks forward one hour which I love so I can come home from work at 7pm and still have a good hour or more of healthy, productive time in the daylight rather than getting home and immediately putting on PJs. As much as I love the cold weather and the winter, I don’t like getting home from work and feeling like its time to go to bed. #2 is St. Patrick’s Day! My favorite holiday. Side note: Excessive alcohol consumption interferes with body’s ability to absorb calcium resulting in brittle bones. Alcohol causes the small blood vessels in the skin to become dilated causing flushed skin and possible broken capillaries. Women take longer to process alcohol and after age 40 we store more fat and take even longer to process and eliminate alcohol. Alcohol reduces the level of Vitamin A within the body resulting in slower cell turnover, decreased ability to fight free radicals, and collagen and elastin breakdown which shows up in the form of sagging skin and wrinkles. How does this relate to skin care? March is the time you should be thinking about making some changes in your skin care products. Since the weather can be iffy depending on where you are, it’s probably a good idea to have both cold and warm weather products on hand if your skin reacts to climate changes. A blustery, windy day calls for protective cream instead of moisturizer and a mild, Spring-like March day calls for moisturizer with sunscreen. The heat in your house may not be on as often or as high and your skin may not seem as dry or dehydrated. Make necessary changes after observing your skin and what it’s doing at this time of year. Spring cleaning anyone? Don’t forget to include your medicine cabinet and make-up bag. Time to get rid of those crusty tubes and bottles sitting around. Who the heck knows how old those things are? Replenish your sunscreen products which lose efficacy after 3 years. My question to you is why do you have a bottle of sunscreen that is 3 years old? The answer is: because you aren’t using it as often as you should or you aren’t using enough. May I state again for the record, the sun is the number one factor that ages the skin. Period. Use your sunscreen. A shot glass full (approximately 1.5oz) is enough to cover the body. Are you itching to get into the sun and get a tan? NO! Run to the nearest store or click here and order a self tanning lotion! Are you resistant to the idea of using sunscreen moisturizer every day? Then change your make up to something that has a built in sunscreen like mineral make up or tinted moisturizer. Really, I can’t stress this enough. I’m really going to lose it one day if another person asks me for anti-aging, wrinkle repair products or something to reduce discoloration then in the next breath tells me they don’t want sunscreen in their moisturizer. Wash your make-up brushes. Something we know we should do but never actually do. Throw away the 15 bottles and jars of random hair products you thought you needed but thardly used. (See Blog: Are You A Beauty Junkie:?)Pick up all the q-tips and hair elastics that are stuck to the bottom of your bathroom cabinets. Replace your make-up sponges. It’s March. That means you have almost 2 full months until Memorial Day and the unofficial start of Summer. You may actually have to take off that giant sweater and start revealing a little more skin. Do you need a good scrub down? Are you dull and flaky and scaly? I’m sure your feet are a mess from skipping pedicures all winter. Assess the situation of your winter skin finally coming out of hibernation. It ain’t pretty, right? Do something about it.

Or that we’re more likely to make eye contact when we’re lying? Discover this- and how to choose the best eye cream – today on the MB Blog! 1. On average, we blink around 12 times per minute, with each blink lasting 1/10th of a second. 2. Heterochromia iridis is a condition in which the eyes are two different colors. Famous faces with Heterochromia iridis include Kate Bosworth and Superman actor Henry Cavill. 3. Similiarly, Elizabeth Taylor’s super-lush eyelashes were the result of a condition known as distichiasis , in which a double row of lashes grow on the outside edge of the eyelid. 4. The skin around your eyes is about ten times thinner than it is on the rest of your face. As collagen breaks down with time, this skin becomes even thinner, a process that can be accelerated by smoking, sun exposure, and other environmental factors. Be sure to use an eye cream that’s right for your skin to slow premature aging and keep the eye area hydrated. [Read: How to choose the best eye cream ] 5. Blue eyes are more sensitive to the sun due to a lack of protective pigment. In fact, repeated exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UV) can later contribute to cataracts and macular degeneration. 6. Eye contact can accomplish a lot. In fact, looking someone directly in the eyes can cause the body to product a chemical known as phenylethylamine , which is responsible for feelings of love. (In other words, if you want someone to love you, make lots of eye contact!) [Check out: our Most Popular Eye Cream ] 7. In our (western) culture, those who make eye contact are viewed are more confident and intelligent as well as stronger than those who avoid your gaze. 8. Studies show that liars are more likel y to make eye contact. 9. ‘Crow’s feet’ are the fine lines and wrinkles that form at the outside corners of your eyes. They are an inevitable part of aging (although good skin care can help slow the process) and are basically caused by repetitive laughing, frowning, and smiling. Using certain skin care ingredients on this area—including Glycolic Acid and Olive Oil —can be extremely helpful in reducing the appearance of crow’s feet.

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by admin"],"url":"http://blog.mariobadescu.com/not-your-average-valentines-day-survival-guide/","Text":["If you want to know the history of St. Valentine’s Day, google it. I’m really not interested, are you? To me and most of the ladies I know, it’s just a day made up by the florists, card and candy companies to make lonely, single people feel horrible once a year, kinda like New Years Eve. Even worse for the recently divorced or kicked to the curb people who have to go into the Valentine’s season nursing recent battle wounds. Regardless, it’s the day when we’re expected to give and receive fattening, sappy, wasteful, corny gifts and if you’re one of the lucky ones, expensive, grand gestures of love like diamond rings and exquisite meals. Below is a list of gift suggestions for whatever romantic or non-romantic situation you may find yourself in. Stimulate the economy and do some Valentine’s Day shopping. You don’t have to spend a lot unless you really want to or you’re really trying hard to keep that special someone, special. JUST DATING You’re not quite sure if this person has any longevity with you but just in case, a Valentine’s treat is definitely in order. How much do you spend? Spend too much and you may send the wrong message. Don’t spend enough and you send the wrong message. You’re walking a fine line here. I’m going to say for a just dating, non-exclusive situation a mediocre bouquet of flowers and some good chocolate like Godiva or Lindt. You can at least get a few pieces of good candy out of it. ESTABLISHED RELATIONSHIP, NOT MARRIED Another rock-hard place scenario. Spend too much and you may get yelled at for spending too much. You’re supposed to be saving for a possible engagement ring, wedding, house, or paying off your credit cards. You’re not really trying to impress anyone at this point anyway. Spend too little and risk getting the silent treatment or a few days of tension for being a cheap-o. Expensive bouquet of flowers and maybe a piece of medium-priced jewelry would be the way to go here. Maybe a dinner that’s a few notches above Applebees or a restaurant that has linen napkins on the table instead of crayons. MARRIED WITH KIDS Are you really going to spend that much needed cash on flowers that will be thrown away in a week or on candy that’s going to make your butt spread even further? The washing machine is on its last legs, little Suzie wants a puppy and Billy needs braces. Just skip it. Stay home, order Chinese food, enjoy some cheap wine (may I suggest a 2009 Yellow Tail Cabernet-Shiraz) and enjoy Valentine’s Day with the person you love. It’s really not about material gifts. DIVORCE IS IN THE FUTURE Tough call, right? You’re still married and you still care about this person who’s just about on their last legs with you. Sad state of affairs and all but you have plenty of time to worry about that since many divorces go on for years and years. What do you do for Valentine’s Day? I’m thinking maybe go with the same gift guidelines as “just dating.” Mediocre flowers and good chocolate. You’re not a monster. It’s safe and shows you made an effort. Now if you’re getting set to lose your shirt in the divorce, skip the chocolate or get the cheap stuff as a message that you are getting prepared to lose half of everything you earned. If you loathe this person and are counting the seconds until you never have to see their ugly face again, maybe grab a box of those horrible, chalk-like candies with the messages printed on them and call it a day. Throw in a Snuggie just to make sure the message is loud and clear. OLD TIME COUPLE- THE SENIORS You can have chocolate because you have diabetes. It gets caught in your dentures too. Flowers? Eh, waste of money right. You have your own beautiful flower garden right in the yard. You have enough jewelry to supply Mr. T for the rest if his life. In fact there are no more gift ideas in the worlds after 50 years of birthdays, Valentine’s Days, anniversaries, Hanukkahs and Christmases. That’s right. Early bird special at the Red Lobster! Ask for extra biscuits and maybe celebrate the afternoon with a virgin pina colada. Get home and watch a romantic chick flick and hit the hay early, Senior style. You’re tired and have done enough real living already, haven’t you? . . . Let’s try to make it through another Valentine’s Day without feeling sad, depressed or unloved. Be the giver of love. Remind yourself about all the people in your life that care about you and vice versa. Let them know. You’ll feel good about it. Oh, any candy you get, eat it all right away and enjoy so you don’t have to deal with the mental torture of knowing it’s around haunting you to eat it- kinda like the Girl Scout cookies torture. That’s the best advice I have. Related posts: LAST MINUTE HOLIDAY GIFTS WITH MARIO BADESCU Have you finished your holiday shopping yet? Me neither.

But the truth is, our hands are one of the most telling signs of age – so no matter how much you protect and prevent on your face, one look at your hands is a sure giveaway. They deserve some respect. And a little extra attention never hurt, either. To make up for all that neglect (or if you just want super-soft hands)… Start with a clean slate. Wash your hands in warm, soapy water and towel dry, following with your favorite, lightweight body lotion or hand cream . Gently massage it into your skin. Heal damaged cuticles overnight with our thick, moisturizing Cuticle Cream to both soften and exfoliate. Using your favorite hand cream , apply it liberally all over your hands. Be sure to massage as you go to work the product in and reduce all that tension build up. Give your hands some much needed R&R!

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Kimberly Yang"],"url":"http://blog.mariobadescu.com/back-to-school-or-an-excuse-for-a-september-spree/","Text":["Whether you’re going back to school or not is irrelevant. The world has two beginnings a year. Are you doubting? Don’t. It’s not just New Year’s when we decide to start anew – there’s the “Back-to-School” movement, so to speak, come September, that calls for an entire detox, re-vamp and shopping spree of epic proportions. Are we complaining? Not in the least bit. Now is the perfect time to start a new skincare regimen. The extremities of summer weather might not be the best way for you to find out what truly works for your skin, making fall the best season to get started. Have fun! Test different products out; there’s nothing more fun than sifting through new jars and bottles. Take our skincare consulting questionnaire if you’re overwhelmed by the choices and are unsure of where to start. But say you were going back to school, moving back into dorms and in dire need of a skincare restock. What to buy? What to use? Here are the essentials: Enzyme Cleansing Gel, $12 . A non-foaming, daily cleanser that removes all makeup, dirt and oil. With work/school/both coming back in full force, a refreshing and thorough cleanse is essential! Cucumber Cleansing Lotion, $15 . An additional refreshing, final cleanse that controls oily T-zones to refresh and soothe. Stress can cause influxes in even the most well-behaved of skin, so as a precaution against future blemishes and acne pop-ups, astringents are necessary in removing pore-clogging residue and disinfecting the skin’s surface. Oil-Free Moisturizer SPF-17, $22 . Hydrating the skin is the key to looking healthy. So, even if you are dashing out the door and haven’t time to put on makeup, moisturizer will make a world’s difference in how your skin looks and feels. Ceramide Eye Gel, $18 . Keep it in the fridge to de-puff tired eyes. A lifesaver for those late-/all-nighters. Drying Lotion, $17 . Good-bye, pimples. Here’s to an instant pimple eraser that works miracles overnight. Drying Cream, $14 . A must-have in every office/handbag/etc. for emergencies. It’s an acne cream that conceals while drying out under-the-surface spots and pimples. Need we say more? Kiwi Face Scrub, $15 . Everyone has time to exfoliate 1-3 times a week. Everyone . If a smoother, radiant complexion isn’t a good enough reason for you, then what if we told you it smelled really good? Lip Wax SPF 15, $7 . Chapped lips never feels good. Rosewater Facial Spray, $7 . For long days or late nights when an instant refresher is needed. Also perfect for spritzing your hair if you haven’t had time to wash it… Super Rich Olive Body Lotion, $10-$22 . Toss the 6 oz. in your handbag or school bag and use the 16 oz. for moisturizing after a shower. We told you back-to-school/back-to-September shopping was fun! . . .

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Kimberly Yang"],"url":"https://blog.mariobadescu.com/types-of-acne/","Text":["Step one in tackling acne? Knowing what types of acne you have and treating them accordingly. (For more tips to get clearer skin, read 5 Tips for Acne-Free Skin . ) Blackheads , also known as open comedones, are large pores plugged with oil. The reason they appear as brown or black spots on the face has nothing to do with being “dirty:” the darkened color is a result of the oil oxidizing once it comes into contact with the air. At this point, they can either remain as blackheads or develop into a papule or pustule (your classic pimples) – hence why blackheads are often thought of as the first stage in acne. What to do: Scheduling regular facials is the best and safest way to have extractions done. At home, however, be sure to cleanse with Alpha Hydroxy Acids and exfoliate often to prevent pore-clogging buildup. Try DIY-ing a facial by preparing a facial sauna followed by one of our clay-based tonic masks to help draw out impurities and tighten those pores. For excessive, stubborn blackheads, using our Silver Powder will help clarify even the most congested of pores to help prevent blackheads and pimples. Cysts are hard, painful bumps typically found along the jawline and the chin area that often last longer than other types of acne. The skin is inflamed deep within the skin, rendering most spot treatments ineffective. What to do: The general rule is to refrain from picking, but keeping your hands off is especially important for acne that doesn’t form a whitehead; you have a greater chance of leaving scars behind. Try using a sulfur-based liquid treatment like our Buffering Lotion . Milia are tiny white bumps that usually appear around the eyes, cheekbones, nose and on the forehead. They’re considered normal on newborns (almost half of all babies have milia in early stages of infancy), but are found on adults as well. Keratin is trapped beneath the outermost layer of skin where it then forms a small cyst (but resembles a whitehead in shape and color). What to do: Unless you have a professional removing them for you, hands off – doing it yourself will leave scars. Aside from manual extraction, however, no spot treatment exists. For most, milia is genetic; heavy, pore-clogging creams can also cause milia. Try switching up your moisturizer and night cream by swapping them for alternatives that don’t have Petroleum or Mineral Oils. Papules are painful red bumps that form once a clogged pore is inflamed. To prevent papules, it’s crucial that you target blackheads and whiteheads before they reach this point of inflammation. What to do: Applying a warm compress to the face can help alleviate the swelling bumps and, as always, never pick! When looking for anti-acne skincare products and spot treatments, check out those featuring Salicylic Acid. Salicylic Acid is effective in targeting blemishes and gently exfoliating the skin without over-drying it the way Benzoyl Peroxide often does. Pustules are your classic pimples and hallmarks of adolescence: they’re red, inflamed bumps that come to puss-filled whiteheads. Pustules appear on the face and the body – typically on the back and chest area – and can affect individuals of all ages. When excess sebum hardens into a pore-clogging plug in hair follicles and comes into contact with dead skin cells, bacteria and dirt, the area becomes inflamed. What to do: Again, don’t pick; you’ll only spread acne-causing bacteria elsewhere and cause unwanted scarring. Be sure to cleanse twice daily with Alpha Hydroxy Acids or Salicylic Acid and always follow with an astringent to help disinfect the skin. Keep oiliness at bay by blotting throughout the day (always with blotting papers instead of your usual powder whenever possible!) and making sure your skin is properly moisturized so it doesnt overcompensate by kicking oil glands into high gear. Try using our Drying Lotion to help dry whiteheads overnight and our Special Healing Powder to help heal breakouts while controlling excess oil. Give your face, chest and back a light dusting of the powder at the start of the day to help speed the healing process. . . . Related posts: 5 Acne Treatment Tips 1. Hands off.

It is a quintessentially American holiday and it also marks the start of the summer season. All of this patriotism got me thinking about what it means when we talk about the American Dream, the fundamental concept that’s at the heart of all of this celebrating and remembrance. Nearly 50 years ago, chemist and cosmetologist Mario Badescu came to this country from his native Romania. In 1967, he opened his Manhattan skin care salon and started work on the signature skin care line that we still use today. Eventually he was working with the biggest celebrities and socialites of his time. This story is the American Dream at its finest. We’re proud to say that our Skin Care Salon has since become a New York institution. Our product line has expanded since those days but has at its core the gentle and effective botanical formulas first created by Mario Badescu. Even better, the Mario Badescu Skin Care Line is made right here in the United States. From all of us at Mario Badescu Skin Care, we hope you enjoy your holiday.

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by admin"],"url":"http://blog.mariobadescu.com/how-to-identify-your-skin-type/","Text":["“What’s your skin type?” If you don’t know, you’re not alone: a lot of people don’t know their true skin type. We’re here to help! Why is skin type important? It is essential to know your skin type and skin conditions (such as acne or sensitivity) before selecting skin care products . For example, if you have dry skin and purchase an oil free moisturizer that’s meant for combination-oily skin, it’s likely that this moisturizer will not be hydrating enough. By that same token, those who are acne-prone should avoid heavier creams that are formulated with oils. Knowing your skin type has one other distinct advantage, and it can help save you money. The more you know, the less likely you are to make incorrect purchasing decisions. (Read: How to choose products based on skin type ) Determining Skin Type There are several simple and effective ways to determine your skin type. One is purely by observation. The other uses a “tool” to help you. (When I say “tool” I mean a simple piece of tissue paper.) The condition of your skin when you first wake up as well as in the late afternoon tells us a lot. Look in the mirror when you get out of bed and also when you get home from work or school. A magnifying mirror is ideal for this. What do you see? Oily Skin Is your skin shiny all over? Shiny only in the t-zone? Do you have visibly enlarged pores? Do you wake up greasy? Does your make-up seem to melt off by late morning or are you blotting and touching up all day? Do you have enlarged pores that get congested easily? Does a humid summer day cause your skin to gush oil that seems out of control? (Read: How to control oily skin ) Normal Does your skin just feel normal ? Minimal shine and no dry patches? No sign of any large pores? The only concern you will have is finding the right balance of products. Nothing too strong or you may become dry and conversely, nothing too mild that won’t be effective. Combination/Oily Skin and Combination/Dry Does your skin sound like the above category, yet you occasionally deal with either some oiliness or some dryness ? Combination/Oily skin has some areas of large pores; an oily t-zone; and the occasional acne breakout. Combination/Dry skin experiences some dryness on occasion. Dry Skin Do you wake up with uncomfortably tight skin that looks dull and drab? Do you moisturize before bed only to wake up dry as a bone? Tight pores, flaky patches? Does this get worse in cold, dry weather? Have you found where you fit in one of the 3 categories of skin types above? Additionally, do you experience redness and get easily irritated by certain products or ingredients? Does your skin look blotchy and uneven? If so, then you also have sensitive skin . The Paper Test for Skin Type If you’ve ever wondered ‘What skin type am I?’ you might want to try this method as well. The second way to determine your skin type is to use a piece of tissue paper, plain facial tissue, or eyeglass lens cleansing tissue. Cleanse with a gentle, soap free cleanser and pat dry. Wait 3 hours for the skin to normalize. Press a piece of tissue paper each to the cheeks, chin and forehead. Did the tissue paper stick? Do you see patches of oil on the paper when you hold it up to the light? Oily skin . Does the paper stick on your skin but when you remove it you don’t see any oil or maybe just a bit from were you pressed on the t-zone? Normal skin . Does the paper not stick at all? No oily spots on the paper at all? Dry . Once you have figured out your skin type, it is essential to realize that it may be strongly affected depending on your health, the season, the temperature and many other environmental factors. Ensure that the products you’re using relate to how your skin is behaving right now. For example, someone with Combination/Oily skin may experience some hydration during the winter months. Watch out for these types of issues and you’re on your way to beautiful skin! No related posts.

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by admin"],"url":"http://blog.mariobadescu.com/employee-spotlight-andeea/","Text":["My name is Andeea and I am a Skin Care Specialist and Make-up Artist at Mario Badescu Skin Care. My skin has always experienced a combination of problems. Growing up in Minnesota the weather was hot and humid in the summer and really dry and cold in the winter months. I had always thought my skin was oilier than it really was therefore I was always unintentionally using the wrong products on my skin. It was not until I went to school for make-up artistry that I realized how important skin care really was, up until then I can’t even remember what I used, but I know it wasn’t right. Before you worry about how your make up looks you should be thinking about your skin care first. The face is like a canvas and the makeup is like the paint. If your canvas is bumpy or ripped you can’t paint on it and if you do, the end result won’t be so great. So you get the point that the goal is to create a smooth complexion so your makeup wears nicely. Now not everyone needs or even wears makeup, but I know everyone wants good skin which is why I have become just as interested in skincare as I am in all the makeup products I had come to love. Working at a number of makeup counters and dabbling in just about every product line department stores carry, I began to get to know my skin better. Even more so from helping others. Since I tend to get excited really easily with most products you can imagine what happened when I started to sample Mario Badescu products. I had just started a new job at Nordstrom in 2007 and they carried a lot more product lines than the other places I had worked. So needless to say after working in makeup for 4 years, I finally ran into Mario Badescu Skin Care. To be honest I really wasn’t that intrigued by it at first because the packaging never really caught my eye. It was located at the end of my aisle toward the back of the cosmetics area. That is the only reason I knew it was there. Who knows how long it would have taken me to examine it more closely. As the customers started asking me for help with Mario Badescu line I started to get curious as to why everyone wanted this stuff and had so many questions about it. I started reading the brochure and soon enough with the help of a few co-workers and some samples I fell IN LOVE! I was getting free products from the counter I managed but would rather pay for the Mario Badescu products. I loved the line so much and it was really truly making a difference in how my skin looked. I was finally starting to get that natural glow that we all crave. To make a long story short, my mother convinced me to move to New York City. The first place I applied was Mario Badescu Skin Care. Knowing about what you are selling and loving it really makes you the best salesperson and happiest employee. I love hearing about the difference our products have made in the skin of all of the clients I assist. It really makes me feel good to know that I am sending someone home with what they need to get the results they want. Sometimes when we feel our skin is at its worst, we pile on the make-up and products hoping it’ll help. That is not the best thing to do. The secret is to find that perfect balance of products to use while keeping it minimal and most importantly, (and unfortunately) you can only address one skincare problem at a time. I always suggest that you focus first on blemishes and clearing up the skin, evening out skin tone secondly, then preventing/repairing aging skin thirdly (and wearing sunscreen daily in your moisturizer which you can start doing right now no matter what your skin condition is like). When you focus on one thing at a time you will get the best results. Some products cover several bases but you have to speak to one of us to get the right regimen if you have multiple issues going on. I always thought my skin was really oily just because I got a few pimples and then panicked thinking I had acne when I did not. I’m just always on the edge of my seat getting too excited over nothing, leaving me to jump to wrong conclusions. I always ran to oil free everything and assumed it would take care of the problems. I tried a lot of things but no matter what, pimples would always find their way to the surface. Now I know that’s because they always will! Skin reacts to a million different things from person to person. Stress, food we eat, food we don’t eat, lack of sleep, hormones, among many other things, and we are not perfect. Unfortunately skin can’t be either but we can do our best to try and keep it in the best shape possible. I know this is from trial and error and now that my skin is clear I know I am using the correct products and have been for 2 and a half years now. But what do you know? I can still get a random blemish every now and then. Why? Because I am human and it’s okay. I have MB to save me. My skin was not as oily as I thought it was I am more a combination skin type (dry in the cheeks and oily in the t-zone area). This is a tricky skin to maintain and the most common skin type. After trying a few different combinations of products my regimen is as follows: Morning: Enzyme Cleansing Gel is one of the first things I ever sampled from MB, absolutely can not live without it. Special Cucumber Lotion : As I said on the You Tube video I was not just saying I love this product…… I really love this product and I can’t live without it. It controls my oily t-zone without over drying my cheeks and its astringent ingredients keep breakouts away. Cellufirm Drops : I love these because they are light and easily absorbed. It doesn’t feel like I am layering a bunch of stuff on my face before I apply makeup and they can also be used under the eye cream. Ceramide Eye Gel : Keep in mind you should always use a light hand with your eye cream in the day if you are applying concealer. I keep this in the fridge because it works great on puffy eyes when you keep it cold. Collagen Moisturizer SPF 15 : This is lightweight. It’s not oil free but I need that extra hydration because I get dry in the cheeks. This feels so light and absorbs right away. I hate moisturizer that feels like its still on your face after 5 minutes. I like it to soak in and start working without sitting on top of my skin like some sunscreen moisturizers do. Evening: Eye Makeup Remover Cream is perfect for removing all my makeup. I also wear contact lenses and it never bothers them. Enzyme Cleansing Gel Special Cucumber Lotion Ceramide Eye Gel and Cellufirm Drops Vitamin C Serum every other night. This is absolutely everything you want your serum to do all in one bottle. Great skin brighter! Hydro Moisturizer with Vitamin C (Spring, Winter, Fall) is lightweight but not oil free. Even though I am combo-oily I have found a good balance of products so I don’t breakout but I give my skin the hydration it needs. If I need more, it’s Herbal Hydrating Serum to the rescue. Some of my favorite products to have in my make-up kit are: Aloe Vera Toner is great to gently remove any excess dirt on the skin’s surface before moisturizing. It is alcohol free so will not over dry. Control Moisturizer for Oily Skin is absolutely hands down my favorite moisturizer for a number of reasons. It is quickly absorbed into the skin, it tones down any redness, oil free, won’t clog, and perfect for combo skin types. I know the name sometimes throws customers off. This is also my Summer moisturizer for when I am oilier than normal. Herbal Hydrating Serum is ideal for prepping the skin before a makeup application whether your skin dry or oily. This serum is oil free so it’s great for anyone and the bases are covered. Special Healing Powder is amazing because of the yellow tint it has. It tones down redness and it’s great to apply to a cystic bump in the day so you can let the blemish heal instead of piling on the concealer. This powder really helps absorb excess oils as well so it’s great for bridal pictures and great for that groom who refuses makeup for pictures. Facial Spray with Aloe Herbs and Rose Water hydrates and leaves skin with a dewy finish as it refreshes your makeup. I spray it in my hair as well. Eye Makeup Remover Cream quickly erases any make-up mistakes and can double as a lip moisturizer in a pinch. . . . All of the above products were used to prep Miss Madison’s, and Miss Kristen’s skin in the pics below. The prep of the skin for the 1950’s period make-up was very important because I used a thicker base and the skin needs the perfect balance of moisture to set this type makeup and have it wear as long as possible without getting cakey.

You know those days when everything just seems wrong and you’re not feeling very good about yourself? In Breakfast at Tiffany’s Audrey Hepburn’s Holly Golightly called her bad-day feelings The Mean Reds. I was feeling my particular version of The Mean Reds about my appearance. Suddenly, my hair was not right, my skin dull, and I started to suspect that my skin might break out. I was at a party and every other person there seemed more attractive than I could ever hope to be. You’re probably thinking that I’m going to recommend a skin care product here, but I’m not. Instead, I’ll tell you what I did (and how well it worked!). The day after the party, I sat down and wrote a list of all the things I was grateful for. This gratitude list included all of the amazing, wonderful friends that, just the night before, I’d been feeling envious of. I realized: I don’t love these people because I think they’re beautiful, but because they are smart, interesting, kind, and funny. Hopefully, they feel the same way about me. Also on my gratitude list? My family, the new book I’m reading, my excellent health, and the glass of fresh juice I’d had just that morning.

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Kimberly Yang"],"url":"https://blog.mariobadescu.com/sulfur/","Text":["What is it? Sulfur is an age-old remedy; since ancient times, people around the world have soaked in sulfur hot springs to cure skin conditions and issues. Today, it is widely used in anti-acne products because of its keratolytic properties, meaning that Sulfur helps promote quicker shedding and exfoliation of pore-clogging buildup. Sulfur is also comedolytic, in which it helps dry out and exfoliate problem areas. Known as a mild antiseptic that helps reduce oil gland activity, it works to dry problem skin to help treat and prevent breakouts (without overdrying). What it does: Promotes cell turnover by helping shed dead skin cells that clog pores and cause breakouts; Helps dry and exfoliate away problem areas; Prevents spread of acne-causing bacteria; Inhibits pores from being blocked; Helps reduce oiliness; and Helps smooth uneven skin tone and texture. We recommend: Drying Mask , Healing Cream , Special Cleansing Lotion C , Special Cucumber Lotion , Special Healing Powder Why we love it: It’s gentle but effective. Unlike aggressive Benzoyl Peroxide, Sulfur won’t over-dry the skin and leave it parched (and further irritated). Instead, it takes away excess shine and helps reduce oil production. Over time, it helps heal existing breakouts and prevents future ones so that you’re left with a brighter, clearer, healthier and noticeably smoother complexion. What you should know: At the end of the day, Sulfur is still a drying agent. Be sure to moisturize well after using any product containing Sulfur to soothe and rehydrate the skin. . . .

Used as an add-on to the classic European Facial, this luxurious treatment mask is infused with natural gold and pearl powder. These sumptuous ingredients work to tone, tighten, and illuminate the skin, encouraging a more vibrant, youthful complexion. My esthetician hand-mixed and applied the mask. Once it had set, it was gently peeled off. The result? My skin looked even more beautiful than it normally does leaving the Mario Badescu Salon. That’s not bragging, I promise—I could have totally blah skin walking in that door and every time I leave it’s like my face is completely brand-new.

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Kimberly Yang"],"url":"http://blog.mariobadescu.com/anti-acne-3/","Text":["Everyone loves Shark Week – us included– but given that beauty is more our speed than marine biology, we’re pretty excited about ACNE WEEK here on the MB Blog. Acne is – and has long been – the most common skin disorder. The secret to clarity (in mind and skin, of course) is to keep things simple. Know your skin and do your research. Discover the very best anti-acne ingredients . Do your research… get clearer skin. . . . Knowing your skin is the first step . Understand your skin type as well as your skin’s needs in order to narrow down which products you’ll need. Step two, then, is knowing what’s in the stuff you’ll be using – and what said products can actually do (versus what they claim to do). Forget the pretty packaging for a second and hone in on the ingredient label like a seasoned pro: recognizing key active, anti-acne ingredients is paramount to cutting down the trial-and-error process. Common active anti-acne ingredients include : Benzoyl Peroxide is one of the most commonly used treatments and featured ingredients in acne products, known for its anti-bacterial and keratolytic properties. B.P. is best used to help treat inflamed acne (pustules and papules) since it targets the acne-causing bacteria while helping reduce excess oil production. It’s effective for some individuals, but be wary of the side effects: it often causes mild to severe dryness, peeling, irritation, swelling, and photosensitivity in the skin, and if it comes into contact with clothing, it may bleach it permanently. Aestheticians and dermatologists alike often recommend Salicylic Acid over Benzoyl Peroxide for those very reasons; Salicylic Acid is far gentler, but just as effective. [Read: Benzoyl Peroxide vs. Salicylic Acid ] Salicylic Acid is another common active ingredient used in acne treatment. It’s a Beta Hydroxy Acid (BHA) derived from the bark of a willow tree and used widely for its keratolytic properties – the ability to act as an exfoliating agent – that help encourage proper shedding of the outermost layer while penetrating pores to aid in decongestion. In addition, it boasts anti-inflammatory characteristic that help reduce redness and uneven skin. For those reasons, Salicylic Acid is a gentler anti-acne ingredient and thus more universal (not to mention effective). [We recommend: Anti-Acne Serum ] Sulfur is probably one of the most undervalued yet best acne treatment product ingredients on the market. Once an age-old remedy used since ancient times to cure skin conditions and various health issues, sulfur now plays a pivotal role in skincare treatments for acne because it’s just as gentle as it is effective. It acts as a mild antiseptic that helps disinfect skin and boasts both comedolytic and keratolytic properties by helping dry out problem areas while pushing to promote quicker shedding and exfoliation of pore-clogging buildup, respectively. [Discover more: All about Sulfur ] Calamine is, in short, is a type of zinc compound (zinc is also an important ingredient to look out for in anti-acne products). It boasts anti-pruritic (anti-itching) and antiseptic properties that help calm inflamed breakouts, and help dry out and clean any open lesions. Zinc, though not a common active anti-acne ingredient, has anti-inflammatory benefits that can help soothe irritated skin.

Our Pre-Shave Conditioner is a smooth gel that can be applied to wet skin before shaving cream. This soothing product includes Lavender to reduce redness and Chamomile to reduce shaving irritation. It also helps soften the hair before shaving.

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Lee Ann"],"url":"http://blog.mariobadescu.com/prep-your-skin-for-prom/","Text":["Aside from graduating high school, prom is one of the most memorable events of a teenager’s life. You can pick the classiest tuxedo or prom dress and get your hair styled at the most posh salon in town, but if your skin isn’t properly taken care of, you’ve defeated the whole purpose of looking smashing at the prom! Check out our tips for prepping your skin for this big event so you can look your absolute best. How can I control my oily, shiny complexion? Many teens have oily skin due to hormone changes, but a slick complexion can be controlled by using the right skin care products: • Choose the right cleanser – Many people—especially adolescents—are using the wrong cleanser for their skin type. Oily skin types should use a gel based cleanser to help strip the excess oil from the skin. To keep the shine factor in check, try our Enzyme Cleansing Gel if you have moderately oily skin. If you have very oily skin, try our Botanical Facial Gel . • Don’t skip the toner – This is one step that most people don’t even think twice about, but using a toner can be very beneficial to your skin. It will help adjust your skin’s pH levels and ensure it is thoroughly cleansed. Our Cucumber Cleansing Lotion is great for oily skin. • Moisturize – Despite your oily complexion, don’t shy away from using a moisturizer. In fact, not using one can actually make your skin look even oilier. Un-moisturized skin equals dehydrated skin, thereby kicking your oil glands into overdrive to produce more oil to compensate for the lack of moisture. Try our Oil-Free Moisturizer SPF 17 for a punch of hydration and sun protection without the greasy feeling. I got a pimple! What should I do? Not to worry—try our famous zit-zapper-in-a bottle— Drying Lotion . It will shrink whiteheads overnight. For red, inflamed type of breakouts, try our Buffering Lotion . Both will be like your secret little weapons to combat a breakout—especially last-minute, unexpected eruptions. I’m very fair and don’t want to look pale in my prom pictures! Don’t even think about the tanning bed! It’s not cool to marinate yourself under harsh UV lights that can cause premature wrinkling (yes, even at your age), sun spots and skin cancer. For a subtle sun-kissed, healthy looking glow, try our Self Tanning Lotion Oil-Free instead. With these tips, you’re skin is bound to look prom-ready!

You’ll rarely see any of us outside in the summer without a big ol’ sun hat on, and for good reason: the sun is the number one cause of premature aging. Even better, what’s cuter than a sun hat? I don’t care what type of topper you’re wearing, you can’t help but feel a bit more elegant and put-together with the right chapeau . The fact that it does double-duty as sun protection feels like an added bonus. Making it through the summer without any sun damage is pretty amazing, too!

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Sara Kosmyna"],"url":"http://blog.mariobadescu.com/soap/","Text":["Once upon a time, before the need for razors, acne creams and anti-aging serums, a female cousin of mine gave me what she thought was sage skincare advice. “I wash my face with a bar of soap,” she said. I was confused. Weren’t bars of soap meant for washing hands? “The same one you scrub your hands with?” I asked. “Yup!” She seemed so happy with her routine; I was intrigued. Curiosity piqued my interest, although not in the way she advised, because I went home, promptly hopped in the tub and lathered my entire head of long black hair into a thick white froth the consistency of cream cheese. I mounded it at the top of my head and felt pleased. “Mom, look!” I said. “I’m Martha Washington!” The horror on her face is forever etched in my memory. Returning my hair back to normal was not easy, but skincare junkies, like myself, tend to learn the beauty do s and don’t s the hard way. So, I eventually decided to try the suds on my face. The results? An irritated, super squeaky clean that left my normal to oily face feeling so tight it was hard to move my mouth or eyebrows without pain. After that experience, I never touched another bar of soap to my face or hair. I’m not sure if my cousin continued on the soap bar path, but I can say that her skin today is a far cry from what it could be. What’s my point? I know that many men and women prefer a minimalist approach when it comes to skincare. And, if a young girl who would go on to get her cosmetology license, work in salons and day spas and spend years researching about beauty and skincare could make the mistake of using a bar of soap on her face and hair, so could you. At the very, very, least, a basic skincare regimen should include a cleanser formulated for your skin type. Why? Because the skin of the face is thinner, more delicate and already exposed to irritation from the sun, wind, heat and air-conditioning. Despite all of this, it still needs to be cleaned, and although the face and body are both covered in skin, they are vastly different when it comes to thickness. Bars of soap that are created for the body do not take into account the gentleness needed for the face. Using a body cleansing bar or gel is one way to parch the surface of the face—throwing the underlying layers into panic mode. Minimalist or not, don’t let my silly skincare mistake become yours!

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Jill"],"url":"http://blog.mariobadescu.com/skin-care-essentials/","Text":["Whenever I’m creating a customized regimen for a MB client, I refer to a checklist I keep on my desk. This checklist has the six absolute bare-bones essentials for any skin care routine. Like the perfect Little Black Dress, blazer, black pumps, and sunglasses, having the basics means being able to put yourself together quickly and easily. In the end, making the effort to get the right basics means that you’ll look better with a lot less effort . The same goes for skin care. Which skin care basics do you need? Here they are! Cleanser. I know— duh . I’m pretty sure that most of you at the very least have some form of facial cleanser in your medicine cabinet. Let’s be sure that you’re using the right one, though. For example, my skin is Combo/Oily, so I use MB’s Enzyme Cleansing Gel . A good friend of mine is Combo/ Dry and Sensitive, so I recommended the Cream Soap . She’s noticed a major difference since switching over from the harsh brand of cleanser she had been using (and no, I’m not naming names here). Toner. It seems that a lot of people are still skeptical of toner. Let’s look at this from multiple perspectives. The first is that you aren’t always able to remove all makeup, dirt, and oil by cleansing. (This doesn’t mean that your cleanser hasn’t worked properly.) Secondly, toner ensures the skin’s pH balance hasn’t been disrupted by your tap water. Tap water can also deposit unwelcome residue on the skin. Finally, depending on which one you use, toner can moisturize, calm , disinfect , exfoliate , and treat various skin conditions. It’s all a matter of choosing the right one (sort of like the little black dress, huh?). Moisturizer. Yes, even oily guys and gals need moisturizer. Think of your moisturizer as a true basic, and be sure to use one with an SPF during the day. Eye Cream. Mario Badescu once said: “Every man or woman over the age of twenty-one should apply an eye cream in the morning and in the evening, as part of the daily routine. There are no exceptions.” I’m not going to argue with Mario, are you? Exfoliant. Whatever you do, don’t neglect to exfoliate. In case you’re wondering, here’s what happens when you fail to exfoliate . Mask. Not only do you deserve a little time to pamper yourself, it’s also important to give extra love and attention to your most troubling skin conditions. Your mask is like that extra-special wardrobe essential—something that makes you look and feel amazing. You don’t need to put it on every day, though. Once you’re set with essentials, you can start to accessorize. And by accessorize, we mean with special treatments such as a night cream , a serum, or an acne spot treatment (that last one might actually be a necessity). Which essentials is your ‘skincare wardrobe’ missing? Related posts: Do You LOVE Mario Badescu Skin Care? Win MB Products On INSTAGRAM! That’s right, we’re on Instagram now!

I believe in layering. Clothes, sweaters, accessories – the more the merrier, especially come cold fronts and hot chocolate weather. But it doesn’t stop there. Nail polish. Lipsticks. Skincare products (you knew this was coming, didn’t you). I have the slightest penchant for experimenting with what works best for my skin (combination-oily, for reference) since interning at Mario Badescu, and I’ve finally found the combination that works . No irritation, no breakouts, nothing – just pure bliss. The evidence is in my complexion! . . . THE RECIPE 2-3 drops of Buffering Lotion 1 dollop of Oil-Free Moisturizer SPF 17 2-3 drops of Herbal Hydrating Serum Optional: 1 spritz of Rosewater Facial Spray THE STEPS Gently massage while cleansing the face – invigorate the skin and wake up those tired blood vessels! Pat dry, and follow with your favorite toner. Apply a few drops of the Buffering Lotion on old spots or any emerging bumps (especially during that time of the month!). For me, that’d be my cheek area. Doing so helps keep my skin clear while preventing any blemishes! Moisturize. I tend to go overboard with it, as I love the finish my skin gets when it’s super soft, supple and plump from the moisture. Again, gently massage your skin while you’re at it – show your face some love! Cold, dry weather is harsh even on my combo-oily skin, so for an extra kick, I add the tiniest bit of Herbal Hydrating Serum to the high points of my face. MB staff doesn’t call this little thing “dewiness in a bottle” for no reason. And to top it all off? A quick spritz of the facial spray. Don’t be afraid to mix and match from different lines. Our skin is much like a fingerprint – unique, individual, temperamental – there are no two skin types that are like. It takes a bit of experimenting to find out what works for you , so why not have fun with it? . . . What is your current Face of the Day combo? We’d love to know!

Soften and improve skin texture; our Papaya Body Lotion has AHAs that add an extra kick of exfoliating benefits. Beautiful legs is serious business! Tan in a bottle. Make the healthy switch! Try a self-tanner instead of subjecting yourself to damaging UV rays (read up on summer skincare for more essential tips on summer-izing your skin ) for that summer skin we’re always after. Let it glow, let it glow, let it glow ! Three words. Summer Shine Lotion . For that perfect, sun-kissed glow. A little bit of shimmer goes a long way – it’s our secret to radiant skin. Plus, it smells like summer, which is always a good thing. … and an extra beauty tip since we love you .

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by admin"],"url":"http://blog.mariobadescu.com/recession-free-skin-care/","Text":["Do you think you have to spend a lot of money to have great skin and look good? That’s what the major cosmetic companies want you to believe, isn’t it. With their $40 cleansers and $300 face creams and $50 foundations you would have to be pretty wealthy to keep up with a long-term routine on those brands. If you look closely at the product labels, many of the expensive brands have the same ingredients as the lower priced brands. The extra price you pay is to finance the company’s bazillion dollar advertising budget and the product’s excessive, and not very earth friendly packaging. Nothing says “I can afford the best, most luxurious products” like a fancy glass jar to hold your designer-label night cream with a $300 price tag! Do not forget to tell your friends how much you spent on it too. Why else would you spend that if you don’t actually have to? In this economic recession, less and less of us can actually afford the little comforts in life like good skin care products much less the designer-priced ones. What can you do to get what you need and love for your skin without having to choose between paying your electric bill or your cell phone bill this month? Money-Saving Skin Care Ideas Invest in a good moisturizer and sunscreen all in one for daily use on your face. Protecting your skin from the sun is the best anti-aging defense you have and you should be doing it every day, sunny or not, winter or summer. Spend the money on a 2 in 1 product rather than layering 2 separate products at twice the cost. Not only are you saving money, you are saving your skin from potentially very dangerous skin cancer. Keep in mind, sunscreens made for the body are not always suitable for the face, especially if you have problem skin. Prevention and maintenance is better than repair, I always say. If you are neglecting your skin and skipping important steps of your skin care routine, you will end up spending more money in the long run on repair products and treatments. For example; you are too lazy to take off your make up before bed or to do your mask or scrub regularly. The result? Your skin gets clogged up, starts breaking out and looks terrible. Eventually you will wind up in the facialist’s chair or worse the dermatologist’s office, spending even more money. A situation you could have easily prevented. Maybe if you didn’t bake your face in the sun for so long, you could have put off those very expensive botox injections for a few more years. I’m all for it (in moderation, of course) but if I can somehow take steps to avoid it longer, I’d rather do that, wouldn’t you? If you can’t seem to make good skin care habits a regular part of your day then you can invest in a package of facials, usually at a discounted price so you can have your skin professionally cleaned every 4-6 weeks. Having and maintaining a tan does not have to be expensive or harmful to your skin. Don’t even get me started on the dangers of using tanning beds or baking yourself to a crisp at the beach. You don’t need the lecture because you are well aware of the dangers of sun exposure, I’m sure. If not, I encourage you to find out. Invest in a good body scrub and self tanner and fake it. There are many excellent body lotions on the market that contain subtle self tanners them which are ideal for adding gradual color or for maintaining your self-tan. Self tanners look beautiful if your skin is prepped appropriately(exfoliate and moisturize first, always) and applied carefully and correctly. Don’t spend on a fancy brand because they all work the same way, with similar ingredients. You can get self tanners for as little as $12 and body lotions with buildable color for as little as $10 . Basically the message I am trying to get across is this: Maintenance and prevention cost less than fixing what could have been avoided in the first place. Think carefully about where your money really goes when you buy your favorite beauty products. With just a little knowledge and research, there are often cheaper, equivalent alternatives to be easily found. Try to be green and use products with less packaging. They usually cost less for that simple reason. Compare labels and brands and make sure you are not spending more, unnecessarily for basically the same ingredients. . . .

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Lee Ann"],"url":"http://blog.mariobadescu.com/skin-type-2/","Text":["Before my esthetician and makeup artist days (in other words, when I was virtually clueless about skin care and makeup), I purchased cosmetics and skin care products primarily based on fancy packaging (like many people do). If it looked fun and glamorous on the exterior, surely what was inside the jar or tube was just as good as the outside, right? If I was drawn to a particular shade of lipstick or eye shadow, I bought it without considering the fact that maybe (just maybe ) it wouldn’t look right against my skin tone. Sadly, nine times out of ten, it didn’t and I never understood why. Go ahead and chuckle—I look back in retrospect and laugh too (and let’s not even get into my fashion choices back then). First, I didn’t even know what my skin type was, which was probably part of the reason I didn’t choose my skin care products accordingly. How was I supposed to know which specific ingredients my skin needed if I was unaware of my skin type? Or rather, how was I supposed to know which specific ingredients to avoid? They say ignorance is bliss, but certainly not in this case! My skin suffered the skin sin consequence by breaking out in tiny bumps. What did I do to fix my skin? I once again used the wrong products and made things worse. Unfortunately I didn’t know about Mario Badescu Skin Care back then, and if I could rewind time, I would have hooked myself up with some Drying Lotion , Drying Cream , Healing Cream and the Anti-Acne Serum (ok, maybe the whole nine). Bear in mind, I’m the same girl who wrote the blog post on how I used to over-do it with skin care products and discovered that less is more. Anyway, now that I know better (much, much better ),my skin has vastly improved. This often happens to estheticians after training, and for good reason: we finally understand the importance of picking out the right products for our skin type! The moral of my story is: know your skin type and use the right products accordingly to avoid a potential skin disaster! Don’t know your skin type? Find out here!

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Sara Kosmyna"],"url":"http://blog.mariobadescu.com/skin-care-products/","Text":["As a licensed cosmetologist, I know how overwhelming it can be for clients both new and old to take on the responsibility of caring for their skin. After all, it’s the largest organ of the body and the one we show to the world. Luckily, once you have the right products for your skin type half of the work is done. So, buckle up beauty lovers and get ready to embark on the journey to gorgeous skin! When it comes to applying skin care product s these easy-to-follow tips will have you feeling like a pro in no time: Cleansing is the first step in any skincare regimen (and facial!). Typically, we associate cleaning with scrubbing, but it’s essential to remember to be gentle. Use medium pressure circular motions with the fingertips to spread cleanser on the face, avoiding the eye area. Makeup mavens should use a separate product specifically formulated for the eye area at night to delicately remove eyeliner, mascara and eye shadow, which can be resistant.[ Here’s how to replicate the facial massage your aesthetician uses on your skin! ] Toner refreshes the skin after cleansing. To avoid overusing your astringent, we recommend applying it to a cotton ball or pad. Always wipe in an outward motion until the cotton wipes away clean. Eye Cream is a great way to moisturize the delicate skin under your eyes, which can show signs of aging quicker than other areas. Using your ring finger, which is the gentlest, apply the product to the area from the highest point of the cheekbones to the under-eye. Work the cream lightly into your skin morning and night to keep the under-eye area happy and hydrated. Moisturizer is perfect for perking up the top layer of the skin by providing essential nourishment. Every skin type should be conditioned with an appropriate product. Moisturizer can be pressed gently into the skin in an upward and outward motion. Masks can benefit a variety of skin types. Whether you prefer to apply your mask by hand or with a brush, you should always remember to avoid the eyes, lips and hairline. Masks are meant to only be worn on the forehead, nose, cheeks and chin. If your mask has a drying effect, avoid talking or making unnecessary facial expressions, which will stretch the skin underneath. Instead, take some time to relax and enjoy the treatment. Exfoliating the skin works to remove dry, flaky debris which inhibits a radiant complexion. Face scrubs are best when a gentle rolling motion is used on the top of the skin. Remember to keep the product away from the eye area, as some face scrubs contain small particles that can cause irritation. While it may take some getting used to, keep in mind that you should never pull, rub, or stretch the face with excessive pressure. The skin is a delicate structure that requires a gentle touch. The most important part of getting gorgeous is choosing products that are specifically formulated for your skin type. Not to brag, but Mario Badescu carries an extensive line of skincare that can benefit all skin types- from the severely dry and irritated to acneic , extremely oily and everything in between. Get your glow on guys and gals!

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Kimberly Yang"],"url":"http://blog.mariobadescu.com/put-your-best-face-forward/","Text":["So said Mario Badescu in his 1978 book, The Mario Badescu Way to Beautiful Skin , a phrase he believed to be more logical than the age-old expression “putting your best foot forward.” After all, he said, the face is what we see first in another person, what attracts us, how we get to know another person. We look for an honest face – open, smiling, revealing. And thus, beautiful skin is crucial to your confidence. How you see your skin – and how you think others see your skin – somehow factors into your perception of self. Is it superficial? Perhaps. But it’s only human to think that way, and feeling less than secure about the face you put forward will always show. Covering up and over are hardly solutions; doing so only makes the hiding more obvious. After all, your skin is your base, your foundation, and most importantly, a part of who you are . Makeup is made to enhance your natural beauty – not to be misconstrued as a means to hide. | “Beauty is every woman’s birthright and beyond no woman’s grasp.” That was his vision, and now, it’s ours. Every one deserves to feel good – beautiful – and feeling beautiful starts with beautiful skin . And with that, we officially welcome you to the launch of our new blog.

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Lee Ann"],"url":"http://blog.mariobadescu.com/less-is-more/","Text":["I’ll admit it- I’m 20-something years old and obsessed with anti-aging. I mean it, obsessed – it’s not an understatement by any stretch of the imagination. I even abandoned my career in the psychology field and delved into the world of beauty (my true passion), becoming a Licensed Esthetician. I scrutinize every line on my forehead or even the smallest trace of crow’s feet on my face. With this fixation comes an addiction for anti-aging skin care products. Let’s get one thing straight: there is no miracle in a jar or any magical pill that will prevent the inevitable from happening- aging. However, SPF is your first line of defense from premature aging and sun damage. When I was first introduced to the Mario Badescu Skin Care line, you can imagine my heart skipped a beat when I got our Vitamin C Serum . But that wasn’t enough for me. I had to have the Cellufirm Drops coupled with the Cellufirm Moisturizer . Oh, and don’t forget the Glycolic Eye Cream , Hyaluronic Eye Cream and the Herbal Hydrating Serum . That’s just half of it. You think I’m kidding? No ma’am or sir. I was piling all the products on my face like it was nobody’s business. Amid the product overload frenzy, something happened…my skin broke out. But being the vain lady that I am, it was as if the world was coming to an end. But I knew better and came to my senses. I had a chat with a fellow skin care expert here at Mario Badescu and she gave me some tough love and agreed that I had overdone it with the products. You’ve heard it before- too much of a good thing can be bad. You’ve heard the old adage before- less is more. So I cut back on some of the products that my skin type didn’t really need anyway. Sure enough, within a few days my skin cleared up. Hallelujah. Lesson learned. Am I still consumed with hanging onto my youth for my dear life? Absolutely- so much so that I might shed a tear or two while lying in a fetal position when I turn the big 3-0. But as we speak my skin is looking pretty good thanks to using Mario Badescu Skin Care and fewer products.

Each time I watch Extra or flip through the pages of People magazine, the jaw-droppingly gorgeous celebs staring back at me motivate me even more to get skin like theirs. The secret to glowing skin is first and foremost a balanced, nutritious diet loaded with fruits and vegetables—especially ones that are high in antioxidants. Furthermore, regular exercise boosts blood circulation, thereby imparting a healthy glow to the skin. Plenty of rest each night is also crucial. To boost your glow quotient even further , it is important to use skin care items that contain glow-enhancing ingredients. Take a peek at our top products that will help your skin look akin to a celebrity’s…by the way, many of them use our products…just saying. Vitamin C Serum Ah, the power of Vitamin C; it can do wonders for the skin. Our Vitamin C Serum helps brighten and hydrate the skin. It is one of our top sellers because of the extra glow it delivers. Glycolic Foaming Cleanser I’m a huge fan of alpha hydroxy acids due to their chemically exfoliating abilities—then again, I don’t know any esthetician who doesn’t love AHAs. I’m particularly fond of the AHA Glycolic Acid because of its power: it has the smallest molecular structure out of all the AHAs and therefore is the most penetrable. My favorite attribute of Glycolic is that it retexturizes the skin, revealing a fresher, radiant complexion. It is no wonder our Glycolic Foaming Cleanser (used two or three times a week in place of your usual cleanser) is also a top seller. Enzyme Revitalizing Mask Imagine a face mask concocted with fruit extracts and Vitamins A and E, which are antioxidants. That is exactly what our Enzyme Revitalizing Mask is plus it’s hydrating. Glycolic Acid Toner And yet another Glycolic charm. I raved about this toner in a previous blog post and I’m going to rave again: I’m an avid user of the Glycolic Acid Toner because it revives a dull complexion. Ginseng Moist-Cream Ok, forgive me for repeating myself, but I did brag about this one in a previous blog post recently as well. In case you didn’t know, Ginseng is a plant extract that helps stimulate blood circulation, thereby perking up sluggish, lackluster skin.

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Subtitle":["facial-massage"],"Title":["How-To: DIY Facial Massage"],"url":"http://blog.mariobadescu.com/facial-massage/","Text":["When I was training to be an aesthetician, one of my favorite parts of school were the facials. As students, we were required to perform facials on our fellow students (and, later, on real-life clients), which meant that we acted as both facialist and guinea pig for quite some time. This meant getting a lot of facials. My favorite part? All that facial massage. Even now, I add a little facial massage to my daily routine between professional facials. And why not? Not only does it feel amazing, it’s also really good for your skin. If you’re just putting skin care products on your skin with no thought to their physical application, you’re really missing out. For one thing, massage increase circulation, bringing oxygen and nutrients to the skin while helping to whisk away waste products. It also assists in product absorption and sends relaxing signals to your brain. You can use facial massage when cleansing your skin or applying moisturizers , night creams , or protective creams . Start by making upward motions on your forehead with the middle and ring fingers of each hand. (Use the pads of your fingers, curving the fingers upward to keep your nails away from your skin). Then, make little circles with your fingers, working outward from the middle of your forehead to your temples. Slip your fingers down the sides of your face and make little circles on your cheekbones (this feels especially good when you’re congested!), working from the temples toward your nose. Then, go around and around your eyes a few times, being careful not to get anything actually in your eyes. Now, take your middle finger and swoop back and forth on the skin under your nose. Finally, use the pads of your thumbs to massage product into your chin. Don’t neglect your neck, either! Make gentle upward motions with your hands, again using your middle and ring fingers.

Therefore optimizing what little space given has become an art, where one must purge the luxuries and keep only the essentials. It’s minimalism at it’s finest. These are the indispensible and favorites which occupy my dresser top. I won’t hesitate to call them my Holy Grail products – they’re things tried, tested and true, and have gotten me through the trials and tribulations of college life . From stressful weekdays and late-night weekends to final exam periods , these are the beauty products I cannot live without: WHO : Kim. MB Intern, blogger, full-time business school and journalism student, and then some. WHERE : Her dresser top, because college students don’t get things like medicine cabinets. Here’s to communal bathrooms. WHAT : Seaweed Bubble Bath & Shower Gel , Glycolic Foaming Cleanser , Cucumber Cleansing Lotion , Ceramide Eye Gel , Enzyme Revitalizing Mask , eye drops for contacts, shimmery nude eye shadow, blush/bronzer, eyelash curlers, mascara. WHY: Seaweed Bubble Bath & Shower Gel : It makes both morning and evening showers that much more relaxing. Plus, blue is just calming to look at. Glycolic Foaming Cleanser : I think I can quote our PR girl when I say this is a “game changer.” People seem perplexed that a stressed out college girl could have such a healthy complexion; it’s valid. I’ll be the first to admit it’s this cleanser (used 2x a week!) has worked magic. Cucumber Cleansing Lotion : Love this, so refreshing. Ceramide Eye Gel : I keep mine in the mini fridge; I’ve become obsessive about eye creams since I’ve gotten it, it truly de-puffs and wakes up the eye after late-nights or all-nighters. Enzyme Revitalizing Mask : Another secret to a healthy and brighter complexion. If I don’t have the time I just apply it to the center of my face, get some last minute work done, and voila, done in 20 minutes. . . .

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Subtitle":["emollients"],"Title":["#SkinSpeak: What are Emollients?"],"url":"http://blog.mariobadescu.com/emollients/","Text":["An emollient, typically some type of oil or lipid, fills in any gaps between skin cells. It directly softens and smooths the skin’s surface, giving the complexion a plumper, healthier, more radiant appearance. In doing so, an emollient helps strengthen the outer barrier: those cracks are “mended,” so to speak, and thus prevents against the dryness, inflammation, and redness caused by external factors (heat, air conditioning, sun exposure, etc. ) Emollients are best suited for drier or mature skin types which are lacking in oil. These lipids help restore the outermost layer of skin, smoothing fine lines and/or gaps to create an occlusive, protective barrier.

The CRF refers to the process that keeps the cells of the body from building up. We’re constantly shedding and regenerating, although this process slows with age. Babies have a cell turnover rate of about 14 days whereas those who are 50+ require anywhere from 42-84 days to accomplish the same task. This is why we need to get increasingly savvy about exfoliation as we get older—to keep skin looking as fresh and new as possible. How are you exfoliating? Are you using a scrub ?

As of late, all the love in the blogosphere and our favorite glossies have been singing praises for the Enzyme Revitalizing Mask , so like any bona fide beauty junkie, I dug into my stash (an assigned drawer just for MB goodies because I, unfortunately, don’t have a medicine cabinet ) for my own jar. There I was cross-legged and white-faced on my bed, wondering how I could have let this mask fall to the wayside. A few drops of Vitamin C Serum under a thin layer of the Enzyme Revitalizing Mask and 15 minutes later, my complexion was, well, revitalized . Days of dehydration from the crazy cold left my skin parched and achy – a creamy blend of Alpha Hydroxy Acids wore away any flakiness while antioxidants Vitamin A and E brought back the glow in my complexion. The takeaway? The Enzyme Revitalizing Mask needs a permanent spot on my bathroom counter so I remember to use it once a week, and good things come from stalking the best beauty gurus on the Twittersphere .

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Lee Ann"],"url":"http://blog.mariobadescu.com/moisturizer-3/","Text":["I have combination skin—I get a little oilier in the warmer season and a little drier during the cooler months. When my skin is leaning toward dry, I rebel against the esthetician side of me and slather on more moisturizer unnecessarily. It requires self control not to commit this skin sin, but I relapse sometimes. Over-moisturizing is a waste of product (and money). Furthermore, layer upon layer of face cream can potentially cause a breakout. Don’t get me wrong— using the right moisturizer for your skin type is beneficial to the skin, but too much of a good thing can go wrong . Instead, apply a normal amount of a moisturizing product suitable for your skin’s current condition. For example, if the cold weather leaves your skin dry, switch to a night cream instead of slathering on too much of your regular moisturizer. Happy Moisturizing!

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Subtitle":["skin facts"],"Title":["Skin Care Vocabulary Series"],"url":"http://blog.mariobadescu.com/skin-facts/","Text":["When it comes to skincare, it’s all about how much you know. To make the very best choice s when it comes to your daily regimen, there are some terms you should become familiar with ( free radicals , anyone?). In honor of learning something new each day (and getting your skin facts straight), grab a cappuccino and a notebook and get ready for our vocabulary lesson! Acne – A chronic skin condition that affects nearly half a billion people annually in the United States alone. This inflammatory disorder of the sebaceous glands is marked by blemishes and comedones (blackheads and whiteheads). Actinic – Refers to conditions or damage brought on by exposure to the sun. Aloe Vera – This is a readily used botanical ingredient that offers soothing properties to the skin. This gentle emollient helps to soften, hydrate, heal, and reduce inflammation in sensitive skin and skin that has been damaged by the sun. Amino Acids – Organic acids that naturally occur in the skin and form the building blocks of proteins. Bacteria – Also called microbes, these are one-celled microorganisms with both plant and animal characteristics. The bacteria most commonly associated with acne is called acne vulgaris. Body Scrubs – Made of small particles designed to be abraded gently on the skin of the body using friction. Designed to help exfoliate, increase circulation, and nourish the skin. B Vitamins – Eight water-soluble vitamins that help with cell metabolism and enzymatic reactions by acting as coenzymes (catalysts). They include thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, pantothenic acid, pyridoxine, biotin, folic acid, and cyanocobalamin. Capillaries – Blood vessels consisting of thin walls that form a network to connect smaller arteries to the veins. Carbomers – A thickening agent used in creams and gels. Ceramides – These lipid, or fat, materials make up the intercellular cement and hold the skin’s cells together so they appear firm and smooth. Dry skin, fine lines, and wrinkles are often characterized when there is a drop in the level of ceramides. Clay Masks – Helpful for clarifying the complexion. Especially beneficial for oily skin, as they draw out impurities, absorb oil, and help to tighten the skin. Dehydration – Resulting in tightness and dryness, dehydration occurs when the skin is lacking moisture in the Stratum Corneum. Even oily skin can be dehydrated, since this has nothing to do with oil production. Dermis – The second layer of the skin; it’s made up of live connective tissue. Emollients – Great for hydration, these are often added to moisturizing products to help with water loss. Free Radicals – These are unstable oxidizers that can cause inflammation in the body. To help neutralize free radicals, it’s important to incorporate antioxidants, like vitamin C, into your skincare regimen. * Information regarding these definitions and all skin facts were obtained using the Milady’s Standard Esthetics Fundamentals 10 th Edition Textbook . … Related posts: 5 Must-Have Anti-Aging Ingredients Hoping to learn more about the ingredients you should be looking for in anti-aging skin care?

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Subtitle":["dry skin"],"Title":["My Newfound Love: Ginseng Moist-Cream"],"url":"http://blog.mariobadescu.com/dry-skin-2/","Text":["My top two skin pet peeves are acne breakouts and dull, lackluster skin. When either of those conditions occurs in my skin, I freak out. My first inclination is to grab my Drying Lotion to nip whiteheads in the bud and to exfoliate my skin when it is looking dehydrated and sluggish. As an esthetician, I can vouch that those solutions are great, but there’s more, my friends. Over the last several days, my skin has looked dull for some reason. It could be attributed to numerous reasons: hormones, a few glasses of wine, lack of sleep, the list goes on. Moreover, the chillier climate doesn’t help. The lines on my forehead looked more noticeable and I was lacking a healthy glow. Knowing full well that certain ingredients help impart a glow to the skin due to their boosting properties, I decided to give our Ginseng Moist-Cream a shot; Ginseng is known to perk up tired, sluggish skin. This is one of our specialty creams designed to protect combination and dry skin types during cold and dry climates. When a product works for me, I simply cannot be silent. If it were up to me, I’d shout it on the rooftops, but the least I can do is rave about it here in my humble little blog post. After day two of using the Ginseng Moist-Cream , I noticed a difference in my skin: it was more radiant and not as dehydrated looking. I was stoked. However, if you have oily or acne-prone skin coupled with dullness, then try our A.H.A. & Ceramide Moisturizer to give your skin a boost.

So many of us have gotten amazing results with this kit— you can read the reviews here — and we can’t wait to hear from you after you’ve given it a shot. Here’s the breakdown: Your kit contains a cleanser, toner, mask, and two acne spot treatments. Twice a day, cleanse with the Acne Facial Cleanser and then apply your toner- the Special Cucumber Lotion — followed by your favorite oil-free moisturizer (we love this one ). Two to three times a week, apply the Drying Mask as directed after cleansing but before toning. The other two products are acne spot treatments. The Drying Lotion should be used on Whiteheads and can be used at night (or during the day if you’re not leaving the house; it is visible on the face). The Drying Cream blends into the skin and can be used for under-the-surface bumps and pimples both morning and night. That’s it!

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Lee Ann"],"url":"http://blog.mariobadescu.com/sunscreen-3/","Text":["As an esthetician, this is a question I get asked from time to time. The short, quick answer is no—it’s not necessarily “wrong,” but it’s also not the best idea. You’re Cheating Your Skin Think about it: why use a sunscreen at night when your skin could benefit much, much more from a moisturizer that is formulated to use at night? Our skin is in repair mode while we sleep; enhance that process with a high quality night cream that is appropriate for your skin type. Night creams are typically more concentrated in formula and contain more emollients (ingredients that moisturize the skin). Take a peek at a few of our night creams… Seaweed Night Cream This oil-free formula is packed with nourishing ingredients such as Seaweed, Collagen and ultra-hydrating Hyaluronic Acid. Chamomile Night Cream Ideal for dry or sensitive skin, this night cream contains Vitamin A and soothing Chamomile Extract. Elasto-Collagen Night Cream For very dry or mature skin types, this formula is enriched with Collagen, Vitamins A and E, and beneficial oils such as Peanut and Carnation. Although it’s not a skin crisis to use a moisturizer with sunscreen at night, why not treat your skin with the utmost care and use a night cream before bed instead?

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Kimberly Yang"],"url":"http://blog.mariobadescu.com/dry-hair/","Text":["Rosewater Facial Spray makes our skin happy, but what about dry hair? Just like our skin, it craves a bit of rehydration, shine (or glow, in skin-speak), or refreshing from time to time. And with the onset of fall, colder, windier weather means staticky, dry locks. The solution? Our multi-purpose Nucleic Moisturizing Hair Rinse . Nourishing herbal extracts help to soften damaged, processed or fine hair types over time. It’s like the equivalent of our Rosewater Facial Spray but, obviously, for your hair. Here’s the sitch: it’s a rinse in a spray bottle, yes, but don’t let that stop you from being creative. These are just a few ways you can use it: Spray on wet hair, from root to tips, after shampooing. Rinse it out after a minute of letting the product soak in, or leave it on as your would a leave-in conditioner – the choice is yours. Use it as a de-tangler. Think of it as a finishing spray! Use it as a treatment for dry ends and locks. The options are endless. Here’s my little secret: if my hair feels dry to the touch (courtesy of my flat iron or heated curlers, the cold and the wind), a few spritzes will add back the shine and hydrate the ends. Should a particularly blustery day have my mane in a bird’s nest, a few sprays and a wide-tooth comb brings back the soft and smooth we all love. If it’s getting limp as the day progresses, I make a quick trip to the ladies’ room, flip my hair upside down, give my roots a few good sprays, flip it back and presto! Volume restored. Flat hair may be my biggest pet peeve, but staticky hair is the bane of my existence. Given the increasing need for sweaters and strategic layering, it’s nearly inevitable with the onset of fall. Inevitable need not mean you have to suffer through the static, though: spray the product onto your hair directly or into your hands, moving from the ends up to the middle of the head. You’ll have forgotten what staticky, dry hair even was; that’s what a good spray will do. . . . For more haircare tips, click here .

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Lee Ann"],"url":"http://blog.mariobadescu.com/wedding-day-last-minute-skin-savers/","Text":["From wedding planning to the hustle and bustle of the wedding day itself, getting married is a major stressor albeit the best time of a woman’s life. However, amid the nostalgic moments of stamping invitation envelopes to laughter at the rehearsal dinner, the commotion of it all can wreak havoc on your skin. For instance, I’ll admit- I got a cold sore the day before my wedding! I know, I know- frightening. But fear not: I’ve highlighted our best skin savers that will keep that precious skin of yours in check so you can be the beautiful bride you really are! Oh no! A pimple emerged on my face…what should I do? First of all, relax. It’s just a zit. Secondly, we have what you may as well call a magic-potion-in-a-bottle… our world famous Drying Lotion . That stuff will zap a whitehead overnight, but if you wake up with a zit on the day of the wedding (bummer), apply an ice cube on the blemish for a few minutes to help reduce inflammation. Or try our Drying Cream – it’s a dual-purpose formula that will not only help dry up small pimples, but will also help conceal the blemish. On the other hand, if you have a large, cystic blemish (think red and inflamed), then apply our Buffering Lotion on the affected area. Are you wearing a strapless or spaghetti-strap dress and you have body acne? You can also use the Buffering Lotion on your back or anywhere on your body that has a nasty pimple. And resist the urge to pick your face. That will only make matters worse, so hands off! Remember, good ol’ foundation and concealer will help mask that pimple, so it’s all good! If you can, hire a good makeup artist and she (or he) will work their magic. Wedding jitters kept me up all night and now I have puffy, tired eyes! It happens to the best of us, but it’s especially not cool on your own wedding day. The first thing you should do upon waking is to splash cold water on your face. This will help give you a quick jolt of energy, plus the cold sensation on your eye area will help constrict blood vessels and reduce swelling. Then, gently press cold tea bags underneath your eyes for about 15 minutes- this will also help reduce the puffiness. Lastly, apply our Ceramide Eye Gel to soothe the eye area and further alleviate puffy, tired eyes. If possible, refrigerate the eye gel the night before so the coolness will perk up those eyes even more. I have cold feet…er, a red, flushed face! Help! Although ‘cold feet’ is not exactly our area of expertise, we do have amazing products to help calm the redness. Try our Azulene Calming Mask or Calma Mask .

Acne is the most common skin condition in the U.S., affecting nearly 85 percent of the population at some point in their lives. Individual factors dictate the types of acne experienced, but all acne forms as a result of: Bacteria; Excess oil production; and Dead skin cell buildup. When excess dead skin cells create a plug in hair follicles, bacteria and oil have the opportunity to fester within the clogged pores. Infection or inflammation may occur as a result, causing these plugs to develop into blackheads, whiteheads, pustules, or cystic acne. Hormonal fluctuations, lifestyle habits, medications, and anything that comes into contact with skin (hair products, skin care, cosmetics, perfumes, certain fabrics, etc. ) can all trigger acne formation. What are Pimples? Pimples are a type of acne breakout, specifically referring to red, raised bumps occurring when sebum accumulates behind blockage. These spots appear as papules (solid, rounded pink or red bumps) or pustules (pus-filled red bumps). What are Cysts? Cystic acne occurs when inflammation and infection is deeply rooted in the skin. Where pimples are small, red blemishes, cysts are large, often painful bumps. While clearly visible, these are typically colorless and do not come into a head. . . .

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Subtitle":["BadAdvice"],"Title":["The Worst Beauty Advice I’ve Ever Heard"],"url":"http://blog.mariobadescu.com/beauty-advice-2/","Text":["We’ve all fallen prey to terrible beauty advice at some point. The problem is, so much of this advice actually seems to make sense. As a licensed esthetician and professional makeup artist, I’m no longer vulnerable to misguided and patently wrong guidance, but I know how difficult it can be to discern between what’s correct and incorrect. The tips below represent some of the very worst beauty advice I’ve ever heard. Skip moisturizer and let your natural oils do the work. This may sound logical, but skipping moisturizer after washing your face will leave it dehydrated and thirsty. Moisturizer is particularly important at night because your skin is in repair mode while you sleep. Don’t apply moisturizer underneath makeup… if you do, your makeup will slide off. Why is everyone so anti-moisturizer? The opposite of this advice is true. It is always best to apply makeup on a freshly cleansed, toned, and moisturized face as it will ensure the makeup is applied more smoothly and will also help the makeup last longer. Toner is unnecessary. Toners are often overlooked because many people don’t know why they’re so useful. They help to remove impurities that are often found in tap water (chlorine, harsh minerals, heavy metals, etc.) and they ensure that every trace of makeup is removed after cleansing the skin. They also provide additional benefits to the skin and target specific skin concerns. For instance, our Seaweed Cleansing Lotion (my personal favorite) contains witch hazel, a natural astringent, as well as Seaweed Extract to nourish the skin. It’s a win-win. Exfoliate daily. There are plenty of brands out there that will advise you to use their exfoliants every day. Yikes! Exfoliating on a daily basis is overkill and could potentially damage your skin’s protective lipid barrier. If you have combination/dry or dry skin, you only need to exfoliate about twice a week. If you have combination/oily or oily skin, you need to exfoliate three to four times a week. Every Woman Should Wear a Rich Night Cream Although a rich night cream is luxurious and also enriching to the skin (night creams help aid in repairing your skin while you sleep) they’re not for everyone. Heavier night creams are designed for dry, mature skin types. If used on oily or even combination skin, they can possibly provoke breakouts because the formula is too rich for an oilier skin type to handle. When those with oily or combination/oily skin become dehyrated, they should be careful to use an oil free night cream. What’s the worst beauty advice you’ve ever heard? Did you follow it?

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Jill"],"url":"http://blog.mariobadescu.com/clogged-pores/","Text":["Clogged pores are a major cause of Acne and Blackheads (other culprits include bacteria; certain cosmetics; and hormonal triggers). You can partially blame retention hyperkeratosis , which causes dead skin cells to loiter in the pores rather than shedding normally. Retention hyperkeratosis is a hereditary factor, which might help explain why acne tends to run in families. Another factor is excessive sebum production—or rather, too much oil in the skin. Sometimes oil production is ramped up by hormonal changes and sometimes your skin just normally produces a lot of oil all the time. Either way, when excess sebum mixes with dead skin cells in the pores, comedos occur. Comedos = clogged pores. When clogged pores are closed off from the environment with a seal of skin cells, they can become whiteheads, pimples, or cystic breakouts. Blackheads are the opposite of this—they are clogged pores which are exposed to the air, thus oxidizing the oil/skin cell mixture and causing it to turn a darker color. [Read more: What causes large pores? What can you do about them? ] Here’s what to do when you’re experiencing a lot of clogged pores/acne/blackheads: Step 1: Double-check your skin care products. Oil-based moisturizers, for example, are a bad choice if you have oily/acne-prone skin. Instead, choose an oil-free moisturize r . The same goes for your makeup products. If you’re using foundation, check out the ingredients. Is your daily foundation oil-free? Step 2: Start a regular skin care regimen. This includes twice-daily cleanser , toner , and moisturizer. Regular care will help normalize oil production in the skin. Also, cleansing regularly can help reduce bacteria on the surface of the skin (the bacterium that causes acne among them), while toning works to target specific skin issues such as excess oil, acne, or sensitivity. Step 3: Incorporate chemical exfoliants into your regimen. Don’t be afraid of the term chemical , here—we’re just talking about ingredients that naturally dissolve the bonds between dead skin cells, thereby helping to shed more quickly. Glycolic Acid , made from sugar cane, is an alpha hydroxy acid that offers fantastic exfoliation. Salicylic Acid comes from the bark of the willow tree and is a beta hydroxy acid perfect for helping to encourage desquamation (the shedding of skin cells) Step 4: Reduce oil in the pores. Using oil-absorbing masks and other products can help address the other main cause of clogged pores—excess sebum production. Masks that contain Kaolin Clay help absorb excess oil to help treat and prevent pore clogging.

Here’s the science: Collagen is a Protein comprised of A mino Acids which are linked together with Peptide Bonds . Peptides play an important role in helping to replace lost collagen. How do PEPTIDES work in skin care? As we age, Collagen and moisture deplete in the skin. The strong cell walls that maintain a youthful complexion become thinner and less capable of keeping the skin tight. Peptides help restore a more youthful appearance in the skin by communicating with the cells, signaling them to create more collagen. They essentially trick the skin into believing it has recently lost collagen. Continued use of Peptides in skin care can help: Encourage increased Collagen production; Inspire a more even skin tone and visibly smoother skin; Restore a youthful, luminous glow; and Improve skin’s overall appearance. What are the best Peptides for skin care? We suggest looking for high-performing Peptides such as Palmitoyl Oligopeptide and Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7. The latter of these two is believed to work by muting the effect of chemical messengers known as interleukins that trigger inflammatory responses in the skin. It may also reduce the cumulative damage that occurs due to UV light, pollution, and internal stress.

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Lee Ann"],"url":"http://blog.mariobadescu.com/cystic-acne-2/","Text":["You’re not alone. Cystic Acne can be challenging, frustrating, and (for some) embarrassing. Both teenagers and adults can have this type of breakout. What is Cystic Acne? Cystic Acne is one of the most severe types of acne. It is characterized by soft, fluid-filled bumps that are under the surface of the skin and can be painful. A subset of cystic acne, nodulocystic acne is similar in that it forms under the skin. The main difference between cystic and nodulocystic acne is that nodules, unlike cysts, are firm to the touch and can take longer to heal.* What Causes Cystic Acne? Contrary to popular belief, cystic acne has nothing to do with skin that is not ‘clean enough.’ In fact, the sufferer is not at fault whatsoever. Some factors that can cause acne are: · Excessive oil production · Abnormal dead skin cell buildup · Bacteria I Have Cystic Acne. Which Products Should I Use to Care For My Skin? Buffering Lotion The water-like consistency of the Buffering Lotion helps it to absorb easily. To use this unique formula simply shake until the white sediment at the bottom of the bottle dissolves into the clear liquid and apply a drop to a clean fingertip then gently apply to the cyst. Repeat this until all cysts have been treated. This is a spot treatment, and is not meant to be applied to the entire face. Herbal Hydrating Serum Balance your skin by using our oil-free serum to help promote hydration. Apply a thin layer over your moisturizer during the day. If you are very oily, try applying this serum in place of a moisturizer. Drying Mask The Drying Mask can be used up to three times a week on affected areas to help clear up acne eruptions. It goes hand-in-hand with our… Healing and Soothing Mask Help soothe irritation and redness that is caused by acne. For optimum results, use this mask alternately with the Drying Mask. Special Cucumber Lotion A toner designed for acne-prone skin, our Special Cucumber Lotion helps disinfect inflamed acne while preventing new ones from erupting. Acne Facial Cleanser It is imperative to use a cleanser that is specifically formulated for acne-prone skin such as our Acne Facial Cleanser. It contains acne-fighting Salicylic Acid as well as a host of soothing ingredients such as Chamomile and Aloe Vera to balance and soothe the skin. Control Moisturizer for Oily Skin Many people who have acne shy away from moisturizer, fearing it will aggravate their oily, acne-prone skin. The opposite is true: not using a moisturizer can actually make acne worse in the long term because your oil glands will produce more oil to compensate for a lack of moisture. Oil and moisture are two entirely different things and everyone’s skin needs moisture. Try our Control Moisturizer for Oily Skin, an oil-free formula that is designed to help control excessive oil production, while providing the moisture the skin needs. *Cystic acne can range from mild (having one or two cysts) to very severe (90% of the face chest and back being affected) and may require the care of a dermatologist. Don’t let cystic acne stand in your way. Take a stand and fight it with MB products designed for cystic blemishes.

Anyone who’s with me in having these lightning bolt-esque changes in texture somewhere on their body knows that stretch marks can really put a damper on beach day fun. If you’re pregnant or planning on rapidly gaining weight for the next Hollywood blockbuster, then there’s a good chance you may develop changes in skin texture, which can appear anywhere on the body—but mostly wherever there is a larger amount of fat stored. Stretch marks are a type of scarring that happens when the dermal layer is torn during times of very quick weight changes, like adolescence and pregnancy. Muscle Oil features a combination of Vitamins A, D and E, as well as Almond and Eucalyptus Oils to nourish the skin and enhance elasticity. For best results, apply a few drops to the area morning and night. Then add a layer of hydrating body moisturizer (like our Vitamin E Body Lotion ) to seal in the benefits and leave your skin feeling supple. Related posts: Pregnant? Worried About Stretch Marks?

Is it time to use those frequent flyer miles? Just remember- with changes in altitude, there’s a good chance that your skin will be in need of a pick-me-up before you reach your final destination. Staying moisturized is central to good hydration. Our Hydro Emollient Cream is ideal for dry and sensitive skin types that fly frequently. It coats the top layer of the skin with a host of protective ingredients that include Peanut Oil, Beeswax, Collagen and Squalene. Another great product that goes well with the cream is our Facial Spray with Aloe, Herbs, and Rosewater , which is one of my go-to products year round. This soothing spritz has a beautiful smell and refreshes my skin on contact. Since this product comes in a 4 oz. bottle, we suggest adding it to a 3 oz. spray bottle to follow airport guidelines. If there’s only one other product to put in your pocket, it’s our Lip Wax . Since the lips do not produce oil on their own, it’s essential to keep them moisturized and protected year round, and especially during times of increased travel. Where are you headed this winter?

Here’s how: Be sure you are consistent with your recommended skin care regimen (day and night). There’s a reason your esthetician created that specific regimen for your skin, so stick with it!

If you have combination skin, you are likely either more oily or dry; we call these types Combo-Oily and Combo-Dry . You have only one skin type. This determines the basic needs of your skincare. Consider your skin type the foundation of putting together your regimen. Skin condition: Pertains to whether you have Sensitivity, Acne , Aging , Couperose, Sun Damage or other conditions. You can have any combination of skin conditions. Even pregnancy falls under this category. Many of these, like Rosacea, Eczema and Psoriasis, should be diagnosed by a doctor.

Stash it in your dorm room, your backpack, your tote, your locker, your pencil case, your school-emblazoned sweatpants – it’s compact enough to fit wherever, for whenever you need it most. After all, pesky blemishes have a nasty habit of popping up when least expected (and can be exacerbated by school-induced stress ). You want to be well-prepared; the last thing you should be worrying about is feeling self-conscious about your skin. Here’s where the Drying Cream comes into play. It’s the ultimate two-in-one acne cream that helps heal and conceal, making it handy for a discreet cover-up in between (or during!) classes. Formulated with Zinc Oxide and rich in Aloe to help effectively help dry up those small-under-the-surface bumps and pimples to prevent them from getting larger and spreading. Use a light hand with this stuff; pat a small dab of the product on and blend it over the affected area and into the skin for a seamless application. Not only will it help conceal spots on fair to medium skin, and help cancel out any redness for darker skin tones (making it perfect as an on-the-go spot treatment or as a color-correcting base for concealer), but it also helps encourage the healing process.

Luckily, it’s especially magical in fall. Here are 10 things to do in NYC before fall weather is really upon us. The iconic Jeff Koons sculpture, via @abitcoquettish . 1. Jeff Koons: A Retrospective . It’s Jeff Koons, it’s the Whitney, and the exhibit ends October 19. There’s something about modern art – particularly Koons – that elicits interesting conversation, but if art isn’t quite your speed, just think of all the amazing #selfie opportunities you’ll get… [Read: How to take the perfect selfie ] 2. Plan a Perfect Picnic in Central Park . You won’t even have to do that much planning – Perfect Picnic will make that perfect, Central Park picnic happen. 3. Go to an outdoor movie . Bryant Park, McCarren Park, and plenty of other iconic parks are screening free films. All that’s left for you to do is pack a few blankets, grab some wine, and convince a few friends to come along. 4. Get a sweeping view of beautiful, beautiful NYC . Hop on the Staten Island Ferry (it’s free!) for a scenic view of Lady Liberty, the harbor, and the iconic Manhattan skyline. Perfect to go alone or as a date with a special someone. 5. Float in a pool…on the river . From now until September 1, celebrate the all that’s sun and summer. The Floating Pool at Barretto Point Park (in the Bronx) is a huge pool that rests atop a barge, so it’s almost like you’re floating in the river. But safely, in the comfort of chlorinated, filtered water. 6. Socrates Sculpture Park . Milk the sun and warmth while you can (while wearing broad spectrum SPF protection , of course) and explore this beautiful park. It’s one of the only places in the city to showcase such a great amount of large-scale sculptures and other multimedia installations. Visit for the art experience just because , or look up their calendar for any upcoming special events. [We recommend: Oil Free Moisturizer SPF 30 ] 7. Coney Island . Undoubtedly a quintessential New York City destination, it’s a must-do to spend an entire summer’s day enjoying the beautiful beach and historic boardwalk of Coney Island. 8. Smorgasburg . So technically it’s open every weekend, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. from now until November 23, but eating out on the waterfront for some local flavor is best done on a summer day. It’s something you can do for more than just a day with friends and family; 100 vendors are featured every weekend, plus, there’s plenty of outdoor activities in between all the taste testing you’re bound to do. 9. Enjoy all the best rooftop bars in NYC . Few things are better than good drinks, good friends, and good conversation, all shared atop beautiful rooftops overlooking the NYC skyline. 10. Rockaway Beach . When in doubt, escape toward the sea. Relax on the beach or wander the boardwalk. Whatever it is, enjoy . After all, summer only comes around once every year. . . . Not in NYC?

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Jill"],"url":"http://blog.mariobadescu.com/skin-care-routine/","Text":["We all have one thing in common, the fact that we’re all covered in our own unique protective outer layer called skin . However, everyone’s relationship with their skin is different. Answer the following questions to determine if your relationship with your skin is destined for Lovers’ Lane, Relationship Counseling, or an Unhappy Marriage ( and how to improve the way you feel about your skin through the very best skin care routine!). 1. You wake up in the morning and look in the mirror. What’s the first thing you think? a. Wow, that’s some serious bedhead. Skin looks great. b. Ugh, I wish these (blemishes/fine lines/sun spots) would just disappear. c. What mirror? Like looking into the sun, I avoid staring directly at my skin. 2. During cleansing you… a. Use tepid water and gentle, circular motions with your fingertips; pat dry. b. Sometimes you’re gentle, sometimes you’re rough—depends on the day. c. Scrub roughly and rub your face with a towel to dry it. 3. You moisturize: a. Morning and night. b. When you remember. c. Never. 4. Exfoliation requires: a. Gentle but firm pressure. b. A commitment I can’t always keep. c. Roughness and dedication. 5. You protect your skin from the sun: a. Every day, year-round, regardless of weather. b. In the summer and on especially sunny days. c. After a bad sunburn. Mostly As: Madly in Love You love your skin and make it a habit to regularly care for it with a consistent regimen. Stay on the forefront of having your best skin by: Consulting with a skin care specialist every so often Incorporating antioxidants like vitamin c and anti-aging ingredients like peptides into your regimen. Maintaining your dedication to having your best skin! Mostly Bs: Love/Hate Some days you feel happy with your skin and treat it well, some days other things take top priority. For your best skin, remember: It takes time and consistency to see the best results. Spot treatments are an invaluable resource for helping with acne, sun spots, and fine lines. Being too rough with the skin can lead to irritation and micro-injuries, so be gentle even if you’re in a hurry! Cleansing , toning , and moisturizing should be done twice daily to keep the skin looking and feeling its healthiest. Exfoliation should be performed up to three times per week to keep dull skin that can cause breakouts at bay. Sun protection is a must year-round, even on cloudy days. Up to 80 percent of the sun’s rays can penetrate through clouds. Mostly Cs: Unloved Your skin (whether clear, aging, or acne prone) tends to frustrate you. Maintaining a regimen hasn’t been a priority, and you’re noticing the effects. To turn around your skin woes, remember to: Cleanse , tone , and moisturize with sunscreen daily. (Really, it makes a difference!) Exfoliate a few times per week using gentle, but firm, pressure. Be kind to the skin. Roughly washing, drying, and exfoliating can cause damage to the top layer of the skin, leading to irritation and increased sensitivity. Use treatment products for stubborn breakouts, fine lines, and wrinkles. Excessive sun exposure can result in premature aging, sun spots, and skin cancer; year-round, and even on cloudy days, ultraviolet rays from the sun can penetrate the skin. Remember that sun exposure can exacerbate conditions like acne, as well as darken scars and spots. Related posts: Quiz: What’s Your Fall Beauty Must-Have?

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Kimberly Yang"],"url":"http://blog.mariobadescu.com/five-ways-to-beat-stress/","Text":["The start of September – a new school year, quarter, etc. – can be stressful. We understand – we’ve been in your place, and still are. It wreaks havoc on our skin; no sleep? Puffy, dark circles creep up. Anxiety? Hello, stress pimple . And while we all wish there was some means of banishing stress itself all together (we’ll keep waiting for that day), the best thing to do is to take a step back and relax. Breathe . Take five, and any time you’re feeling stressed, keep these five tips in mind: Remove all your makeup . Let your skin breathe, literally. You’ll feel cleansed and refreshed. Take five, and stretch . Extend it to half an hour if you can. Take a brisk walk – enjoy the fresh air and scenery. Go for a quick jog or run. Stretch out every part of your body. Exercise releases endorphins. (And so does chocolate!) Take a shower or a bath . Soothe, calm, relax – indulge in soaps and bath products to help decompress. Give yourself these 10-30 minutes of alone time: you deserve it. We recommend the Seaweed Bubble Bath & Shower Gel : a fragrant body wash with an invigorating blend of botanical extracts nourish and revitalize. Apply a mask . We all have 20 minutes to spare regardless of how busy our day is. The benefits are twofold: (1) you’re guaranteed 20 minutes of relaxation to do with as you will; place cucumbers over your eyes and nap, or read that book you never seem to have the time to finish, and (2) you’re doing your skin a favor, whether it be a cleansing, tightening or calming mask! Light a candle . Make a cup of herbal tea, bring out your favorite stack of books or DVDs, and let yourself wind down after a long day. And if you still get that stress pimple, we know you know exactly what to do: reach for a Q-tip and that bottle of Drying Lotion ! What do you do to decompress and de-stress?

Cleansing , toning , moisturizing … where does steam fit in and why should you care? It turns out, steaming helps the skin in a number of important ways. The benefits of facial steaming include: 1. Warming up the surface of the skin, thereby making it more receptive to treatment (mask, serums , etc.) 2. Enhancing circulation 3. Increasing perspiration, helping to remove toxins from the skin 4. Softening debris inside the pores for easier removal 5. Increasing relaxation Be sure to steam your skin before mask application but after cleansing and exfoliating. There are two methods for steaming the face during an at-home facial. The first involves submerging clean towels in hot water and applying them to your face after they are lightly wrung out and cooled down. The other option is to bring a pot of water to a boil and then turn off the stove. With a clean towel draped over your head, place your face above the pot to trap the steam. Both methods can be used for a minute or two, and caution should always be taken when steaming. Too much steaming can cause problems, including redness and sensitivity, that outweigh the advantages of face steaming. What’s your favorite way to steam your face? Click here to learn the 5 steps for the perfect at-home, diy facial. *Skin with severe acne or any other condition (such as sensitivity or redness) should consult with a skin professional before steaming at home. This is only restricted for acne sufferers when the skin is irritated, broken or raw; use your best judgement when deciding whether or not to steam.

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Jill"],"url":"http://blog.mariobadescu.com/jowls/","Text":["Tight jawlines change as we age. Loss of elasticity around the jawline (drooping jowls ) and on the rest of the face is a very common sign of aging. It is part of the natural aging process. If you’re looking for something that can help tighten up skin, you’ll want to check out our Temporary Lifting Mask . This is an egg-based mask that does exactly what you think it will– it firms up the appearance of your skin for a more youthful-looking complexion. Also avoid: Smoking speeds up the skin’s loss of elasticity; certain substances in cigarettes can increase the breakdown of Collagen and negatively affect its synthesis. Furthermore, smoking decreases blood flow to the skin and diminishes the delivery of nutrients. Sugar is another culprit. Eating too much sugar causes Glycation , the process by which the sugar you consume starts to attach to proteins in the body, forming Advanced Glycation End Products (AGEs), causing the proteins to become malformed. Collagen and Elastin are the proteins most likely to be affected by Glycation. The result? Fine lines, wrinkles, and the loss of elasticity. Other factors that affect the skin’s elasticity include: Sun damage , Sleep , and Stress . (Yes, we also noticed that all of these start with the the letter S !)

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Jill"],"url":"http://blog.mariobadescu.com/facial-masks/","Text":["1. They’ve been used for thousands of years. Cleopatra’s use of masks is a famous example. She not only bathed in milk but also applied egg white masks to her face. Stories of facial masks made from a variety of natural ingredients—including mud from the Dead Sea—are found in nearly every ancient culture. 2. Masks are an excellent way to target specific issues such as acne and visible aging. I have a good friend in her 40s who is concerned about aging; she uses the Super Collagen Mask . Another friend of mine loves to alternate between the Drying Mask and the Healing & Soothing Mask to help clear her acne. 3. Many people fall asleep during a facial after the mask is applied. As an esthetician, I’ve performed a lot of facials, and naptime is virtually inevitable. Whether you’re left alone to meditate on your soon-to-be gorgeous skin or treated to a luxurious hand and arm massage, it’s this part of the facial when dozing off is most common. 4. Not every mask is meant to harden and dry on the skin. The Flower & Tonic Mask is made with Kaolin, and is intended to dry on the skin as it draws dirt and oil from the pores. Other masks (the Ginkgo Mask , for example) provide intense moisture and will not harden prior to removal. 5. You don’t have to use a mask on your entire face. Nor do you need to limit yourself to just one mask. If you never have acne on your cheeks or forehead, there’s no reason to use a mask designed for acne in those areas, is there? In fact, perhaps your cheeks are super-dry while you have acne on your jawline and neck. A different mask for those dry areas just makes sense. *** Which mask are you using?

We’re forever adding to our mood board because we all know nothing brings out a summer glow like an all-white look; we’re milking it for as long as possible, even if it means breaking some sartorial rules.

We’re partial to white high-waist, wide-legged trousers, crisp shirts, and gorgeous flowing dresses, but truth be told, these are the little white essentials that we can’t get enough of year-round: Cream Soap , because its uber-mild, non-drying, oil-free formula is gentle even on the most sensitive of skin days; Oil-Free Moisturize SPF 30 , because we simply could not live without our daily dose of broad spectrum sun protection and antioxidant Green Tea; Vitamin E Body Lotion , because soft, smooth, and touchable skin is a necessity whether we’re covered tip-to-toe or baring skin; and Whitening Mask , because we are forever perfecting our skin for a brighter, more radiant complexion.

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Lee Ann"],"url":"http://blog.mariobadescu.com/beautiful-skin/","Text":["Beautiful skin requires knowing what to do and what not to do . 1. Picking, touching, or squeezing your skin Whether you’re simply leaning your face on your hand or squeezing a pesky blemish, all contact between your face and hands should be avoided. You will potentially provoke a breakout or exacerbate existing acne. 2. Not washing your face frequently enough ( OR not washing your face at all) If you wash your face only once a day (or even less frequently), it is time to make some changes. Neglecting to cleanse leads to a buildup of oil and dirt, which ultimately causes breakouts. Cleanse both morning and night for best results—this is especially relevant for removing makeup at night before going to sleep. 3. Choosing products incorrectly What may work for someone else may not work for you. Make sure you know which products are right for you.* 4. Tanning You may be itching for a bronzed complexion, but don’t achieve it at the expense of your skin and health. Tanning beds emit the same harmful UV radiation as the sun; prevent skin cancer and premature wrinkling by boycotting the tanning bed and opting for a sunless tanner-in-a-bottle instead. 5. Skipping moisturizer Regardless of your skin type, everyone should use a moisturizer daily to prevent a dehydrated complexion. Those with oily/acne-prone skin should opt for oil-free formulas. 6. Skipping out on sleep The skin repairs itself while you sleep; disrupting that process by hitting the sack late and not getting enough Zzzzzz s can lead to a dull, lackluster complexion. 7. Indulging in too much caffeine and alcohol Sure, it’s a treat to sip cocktails and lattes, but going overboard with any alcoholic or caffeinated beverage can take its toll on beautiful skin and leave it looking dehydrated and dull. For each glass or cup you drink, replenish your body with a glass of water.

We have no idea what shape the year ahead will take in our lives—and that’s a wonderful thing. Henry David Thoreau once wrote: I know of no more encouraging fact than the unquestionable ability of man to elevate his life by conscious endeavor.

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Jill"],"url":"http://blog.mariobadescu.com/blackhead/","Text":["Yesterday you posted some of your most pressing skin care questions on our Instagram and Twitter accounts. We’re thrilled to hear from you and to answer your queries right here on our blog. Today’s questions are all about blackhead removal and solutions for dry skin during acne treatment. You Ask… We Answer! The very best way to get rid of blackheads is to go to a licensed esthetician for a facial with extractions. Once the skin has been cleansed, exfoliated, and steamed, your esthetician will remove blackheads by applying pressure to the pore. It is never safe to attempt extractions at home as a licensed esthetician will have been trained to extract the pores correctly and safely. In between facials make sure to do your best to prevent more blackheads by using a skin care regimen that has been designed to prevent congestion and control blackheads. If you aren’t able to go for facials regularly, using a skin care regimen that focuses on this problem is essential. If you are prone to blackheads, you already know that they can be stubborn and difficult to eliminate. Instead of trying to find one miracle product that will make them disappear, you will see the best results if you gear your regimen and skin care practices to eliminating blackheads. Here are some tips for building a blackhead-busting facial routine. 1. Mask regularly. Make sure to use a clay based mask 2-3 times a week. Clay based masks work to lift blackhead-causing dirt and oil from the skin to prevent clogged pores and help remedy pores that are already clogged. 2. Exfoliate. Exfoliation helps to slough away the dead skin cells on the surface of the skin that collect in your pores with oil and become blackheads. 3. Use a product that contains Salicylic Acid. Salicylic Acid is a great ingredient for those who are prone to blackheads because it is lipid soluble, which means that it is able to break down oil and penetrate the pore. A product like our Anti-Acne Serum is great for fighting blackheads. It is applied to the skin and left on, giving the Salicylic Acid the contact time it needs to decongest clogged pores . 4. Use a product designed to target blackheads. MB Silver Powder is a super absorbent treatment that is applied directly to the areas prone to blackheads. 5. Moisturize. Since excess oil can lead to clogged pores and blackheads, make sure that you aren’t using a moisturizer that is too rich for your skin. Try an oil free formula that is just rich enough to make the skin feel soft and relieve any tightness that you experience after washing. You Ask… We Answer! Dry skin is one of the more frustrating side effects of acne treatment, and one that most acne-fighting systems ignore. There are a number of options, however, in the Mario Badescu skin care line that work to calm, soothe, and hydrate the skin during acne treatment. First, if you’re using our Drying Mask , be sure to alternate with the Healing & Soothing Mask . This mask was created for the express purpose of calming skin while you’re using acne treatment products. We also carry the Herbal Hydrating Serum , an oil-free serum that can be layered over moisturizer (or worn alone) for an additional layer of moisture. It can be used on specific patches of dryness as well. Finally, if your skin is becoming dry all over, and nothing is helping to rehydrate it, you may need to evaluate the products you’re using; we don’t want you overdrying your skin!

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Sara Kosmyna"],"url":"http://blog.mariobadescu.com/how-to-stop-oily-skin/","Text":["Welcome to the time of year oily guys and girls dread most. The transition from spring to summer often leaves oily complexions shiny and out of control. It’s important to know how to stop oily skin before it gets out of hand Luckily, with the right tools you can look and feel your most confident every day of the year. If your skin is oily , it’s important to get your skincare regimen off to the right start. Deep cleaning your skin with a gel cleanser formulated for oily skin twice a day will help to remove excess sebum (oil) from the surface. Botanical Facial Gel is a great choice for combating intense oiliness without drying the skin. Designed with Alpha Hydroxy Acids, this refreshing cleanser removes makeup, dirt and oil. To combat dull skin and congested pores, it’s important to exfoliate regularly. Those who do not exfoliate are more likely to suffer from acne because bacteria, dirt and oil can get trapped under dead skin cells, thereby creating the perfect breeding ground on the skin’s surface. To gently exfoliate, oily skin types can use Glycolic Foaming Cleanser two to three times per week, in place of their regular cleanser. The second step after a quality cleanse is applying astringent or toner. When done both morning and night, this step helps to remove any leftover oil, dirt or cleanser from the face and neck. Cucumber Cleansing Lotion is formulated to be an effective yet gentle toner that removes excess oil and soothes the skin with cucumber extract. Control Moisturizer for Oily Skin is the go-to product for hydrating oily skin without leaving a greasy film or texture. This soothing blend is ideal for oily skin and those who experience acne regularly, as it’s designed not to contribute to breakouts. It can be used morning and night after cleansing and toning for best results. Frequently, excessive oil leads to breakouts, and that’s when the Drying Mask steps in. This sulfur-based formulation helps to dry up existing pimples, promoting clear, unblemished skin. Excessively oily, blemish-prone skin actively experiencing moderate to severe breakouts can use this mask up to three times per week. May be used on top of Special Healing Powder to help control oil. Alternate with the Healing and Soothing Mask . For those who are acne prone, with only occasional or minor breakouts, the Flower & Tonic Mask is another great option. When it comes to oily skin, all masks aren’t created equal. For those who have especially active t-zones, the Special Mask for Oily Skin helps to combat extra shine. Used as a treatment up to three times per week, this clay-based mask helps to absorb oil and control surface build-up. Diminish surface shine effortlessly with a dusting of the Special Healing Powder . Simply sprinkle some of the powder onto a soft brush and apply to areas of the face that have excess oil. As a bonus, this powder can be used with loose foundation to enhance its oil control. While you yearn for that perfectly matte finish of skin, with just the right amount of dewiness, try to remember that there’s something especially beautiful and charming about having a gorgeous glow that comes from within. … Related posts: Relief for Very Oily Skin Do you have unmistakably oily skin?

It’s also the time of year for the ultimate skincare regimen switch-up – swap out the lighter for the richer, thicker, creamier to beat the cold and dry. This year, you won’t suffer through any of it: you’re one step ahead. CLEANSER . Take half a step back with a milder cleanser as to not irritate delicate, winter skin. For example: are you usually an Enzyme Cleansing Gel user? Try our Seaweed Cleansing Soap come the wintry months. Orange Cleansing Soap lover? Try a milder cream cleanser instead. TONER . As with your usual cleanser, reach for something a bit milder. Perhaps set aside your current one, and instead, reach for one with either a lesser alcohol content, or one that is simply alcohol-free. Doing so will still get you the clean feeling you love. EYE CREAM . Do step it up; our Hyaluronic Eye Cream is probably the best stepping point for those who haven’t previously used an eye cream, or just used the Ceramide Eye Gel . From there, we have a healthy assortment of eye creams ranging from the nourishing to super rich. MOISTURIZER . It’s crucial to swap up for one that can properly hydrate, nourish and help your skin retain it’s natural moisture come colder weather. We have a vast selection where you’re bound to find one that’s perfect for your skin – it’s just a matter of finding what works best for you! But if you need a few ideas, our most-loved with a smidgen more hydration than your beloved Oil-Free include the Buttermilk Moisturizer , Collagen Moisturizer with SPF 15 , Honey Moisturizer , Hyaluronic Moisturizer with SPF 15 , and the Moisture Magnet with Pentavitin SPF 15 . PROTECTIVE CREAMS . While it’s not a must (depending on your skin typ), it’s something to look into: protective creams shield the skin from harsh, cold weather. Because of its richer, thicker formula and decreased water content, it won’t freeze on the skin when exposed to the elements. Such extreme externalities can and will take their toll on delicate skin, causing irritation, redness and dehydration. If you feel your daily moisturizer isn’t enough, reach for one of our protective creams for more intense protection against the cold. BODY LOTION . It deserves just as much attention and care as your face – skin is more prone to being dry, patchy or cracked, so opt for something far richer and luxe in formulation. Our Walnut Body Lotion helps moisturize dry, rough skin without leaving that unwanted greasy film and helps keep moisture levels at a maximum all day and night. If you want something a bit more luxurious (and sweet!), try our Apricot Super Rich Body Lotion . . . . A bit overwhelmed?

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by admin"],"url":"http://blog.mariobadescu.com/new-years-skin-care-resolutions/","Text":["Christmas is finally over, and although I’m still full from the traditional Italian seven fish dinner on Christmas Eve, it’s time to gear up for New Year’s Eve. It’s easy to keep your mind occupied with plans and party favors and champagne, but New Year’s always means one thing to me: resolutions.Okay, so we all hate New Year’s resolutions, and we never really stick to them…but that shouldn’t stop us from trying! I figure as long as it helps me to make strides in the right direction, it’s worth it. Now I just need to figure out what this year’s goal will be…any suggestions? In the spirit of New Year’s, I’ve come up with a list of New Year’s Resolutions that your skin will love. Most people have at least one terrible skin care habit, and hopefully 2010 is the year in which that bad skin care habit gets kicked! Stay hydrated. Water is a great thing, and your skin needs a lot of it. Drink as much as you need throughout the course of the day. Try keeping a bottle of water with you at all times. Exercise! Okay, so this might coincide with a lot of people’s New Year’s resolutions to lose weight, but it is worth saying again. Regular cardiovascular exercise is absolutely crucial to keep blood circulating to all of the skin on your body. Hop on that treadmill! Diet! Like exercise, I’m sure many, many people already have this planned, but I suppose the skin care benefits could just add that extra motivation you need to stick with it. A poor diet can cause breakouts and sullen-looking skin, whereas a good diet can provide your body with all the nutrients you need for great skin. It’s worth it to watch what you eat (but don’t forget to cheat once in a while – it keeps even the most dedicated dieter sane). Sleep! Some people might scoff at the idea of making a New Year’s resolution to sleep for at least 8 hours a day, but it is a very valid resolution, especially for your skin. Not only can sleep help you keep those dark circles under your eyes at bay, but it also reduces stress, which is one of the primary causes of acne! Wash your face before bed. To some people this is a no-brainer, but I think others will understand where I’m coming from. You’re up way too late. You have to wake up at 7AM to start getting ready and it’s already 2. Maybe you’ve had a bit to drink. Regardless of the circumstances, resolve to make it to the sink every night and wash your face and moisturize before bedtime. It will pay dividends. For girls, makeup removal is especially important. A well-hydrated, clean face before you go to bed will give your skin a chance to renew. Cleaning out your closet. Set aside an hour or two and clean house. Dump open that makeup bag. Empty out that medicine cabinet. How many old skin care products do you have? You know they are there. You know you’re never going to touch them again. Just throw them out. It’ll be okay, I promise. If you’re going to turn over a new leaf when it comes to skin care, this is as good a place to start as any. Re-evaluate your skin care needs . Have you updated your skin care regimen lately? Perhaps your skin has changed. Maybe you need to focus on a different problem area. Maybe you just need to adapt it to the current season. Either way, from time to time, take a look at the different parts of your regimen and ask yourself what each product is bringing to the table. Make it out to the salon . Your skin will thank you for it. Everybody is busy. The economy is tough. I get it. But in order to keep your skin looking its absolute best, try to make it out to the salon for a facial every month. Just think of it as regular necessary maintenance, like bringing your car in every 10,000 miles. Don’t pick at your skin! This might be the most difficult of all the skin care resolutions there are. Not only does picking at blemishes make them last longer, but it can also result in scarring and increased breakouts. Leave your blemishes alone, treat them properly, and be patient. It’s worth it! Try! More important than trying to correct any of your bad habits is trying in the first place. While many of you probably can’t imagine what it would be like to not have a very specific skin care regimen, I’m sure there are those out there who can’t even begin to imagine having a regimen, much less sticking to it. The most important part to good skin care, however, is trying in the first place. Every little bit helps. Every step in the right direction is going to pay off in the long run. It’s never too late to start treating your skin right! BONUS: Wear a moisturizer with sunscreen daily. Ask anybody in the industry for their #1 beauty or anti-aging tip, and you’ll always get the same answer. Protect your skin from the sun and you’ll keep your skin looking young and feeling healthy! . . . Here’s to great skin care and good health in 2010. Happy New Year’s everybody!

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Jill"],"url":"http://blog.mariobadescu.com/skin-after-pregnancy/","Text":["There’s no question—pregnancy affects your skin. Once you’ve delivered, some skin care issues may continue to linger—including acne and melasma (areas of hyperpigmentation). The good news is that there are steps you can take to help get your skin after pregnancy back to pre-baby condition. Post-Pregnancy Acne Did you experience acne during your pregnancy? You might still have it… or you might be getting it for the first time. Even worse, you’re probably not sleeping as much as you need, triggering the production of Cortisol and causing body-wide inflammation (thereby aggravating acne). You also might not have as much time to care for your skin as you’d like, thereby creating a perfect storm for acne breakouts. Fortunately, your hormones will eventually return to normal. Until then, try to work in a consistent skin care regimen of cleansing, toning, and moisturizing twice a day. You can also spot-treat any breakouts to help speed up the healing process. [We recommend: Enzyme Cleansing Gel or Acne Facial Cleanser * , Special Cucumber Lotion , Oil Free Moisturizer , and the Drying Lotion *] (See below for important note regarding breastfeeding and acne-fighting ingredients) Melasma Melasma is also known as the ‘mask of pregnancy’ because it often creates a mask-like area of hyperpigmentation on the face. In particular, your forehead, cheeks, and upper lip may be affected by areas of darkened skin. Fear not—melasma usually fades with time. You can, however, hasten its departure with a few simple strategies. Here’s what to do: 1. Always ( always ) keep your skin guarded from the sun with broad spectrum sun protection. [We recommend: Oil Free Moisturizer SPF 30 ] 2 . Exfoliate regularly using an Alpha Hydroxy Acid such as Glycolic Acid. 3. Look for masks and serums with skin-brightening ingredients, including Vitamin C and Kojic Acid. [Check out: Whitening Mask and Vitamin C Serum ] *The Acne Facial Cleanser and Drying Lotion contain Salicylic Acid, which is considered generally safe to use when breastfeeding. However, we suggest you speak with your doctor regarding any and all topical products.

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Lee Ann"],"url":"http://blog.mariobadescu.com/post-pregnancy-skin-care/","Text":["Pregnancy affects everyone’s skin differently; some experience redness while others get acne breakouts or hyperpigmentation (i.e., melasma or ‘pregnancy mask’). Some may even have broken capillaries from giving birth as intense pushing can burst blood vessels. After pregnancy, your hormones are going haywire (which, by the way, explains common night sweats and post-partum depression) and this can wreak havoc on the skin. Redness Pregnancy-induced redness can be managed with skin care products that contain soothing ingredients such as Chamomile , Azulene and Seaweed ; these have anti-inflammatory properties. Acne Breakouts are no fun. Ever . When they are provoked by post-pregnancy hormones, you just have to roll with it, knowing that they will probably subside in a matter of a few short months. In the interim, use skin care products that are specifically formulated to combat acne, namely topical products that contain Salicylic Acid , since they don’t typically cause irritation (if you are nursing, consult with your physician first to be on the safe side). If you have blackheads , mechanical exfoliation is the key method to help banish them. Exfoliating helps slough away dead skin cells and unclog pores, which cause the breakouts in the first place. Face scrubs are examples of mechanical exfoliants. On the other hand, chemical exfoliants include Salicylic Acid, which are ideal for any type of breakout, including whiteheads and cystic acne (hard, painful bumps that are under the surface of the skin). Hyperpigmentation If you’ve got pesky post-partum brown spots, unfortunately there is no miracle-in-a-jar to make them disappear completely, but there are ways to help lighten them, such as: Wearing sunscreen on a daily basis , rain or shine, winter or summer. Pregnancy causes melanocytes (the cells that are responsible for pigment in the skin) to be active and sun exposure can stimulate them even more . Exfoliating to help break down darkened skin cells. Using skin care products that contain Vitamin C as it has lightening properties that will help fade pigment with continued use. Kojic Acid is also used to whiten melasma after pregnancy. Basic and Proper Daily Skin Care Regimen Now that you know what type of products you need to help eradicate a post-prego skin issue, the other half of the battle is when to use them. The following is a basic and proper skin care regimen, respectively: Cleanse —twice a day. Tone (with a toner or astringent). Most people ignore this step, but it is important because a toner helps remove impurities and restores a pH balance in the skin. Exfoliate —no more than three times a week. Serum application. Serums are concentrated liquids or gels that penetrate deep into the skin to perform a specific function. For instance, a serum that contains Vitamin C would be ideal to use if you were dealing with hyperpigmentation or if you’re in search of an anti-aging serum . Moisturize—with a moisturizer suitable for your skin type. Your moisturizer for the day should contain sunscreen and the one for night does not need to be formulated with a sunscreen (for obvious reasons). Motherhood doesn’t have to take its toll on your skin. While you celebrate the birth of your new child, embrace the right skin care products and skin routine!

High quality vitamin oils (such as Vitamins A, D, and E) provide potent protection against aging, damaging free radicals.

Oils help deliver active ingredients—such as Vitamin C or Glycolic Acid —deeper into the skin. Let’s take a look at some of the best oils for skin care: Coconut Oil is luscious and super-hydrating.

They’ll find: (a) A disaster! Towels, brushes, hairdryer, lotions, and potions are scattered everywhere. Your visitor will be forced to dry their hands on the same towel you used after the shower this morning. (b) Your usual skin and hair care regimen is neatly on display; your friend will need to dry his/her hands on the same clean hand towel you’re using. (c) Everything is carefully put away, out of sight. A fresh hand towel is ready for your guest. How do you choose which skin care products to use? (a) I give everything a try! (b) I’m currently using the absolute basics— cleanser , toner , and moisturizer . (c) I speak with a skin care specialist to ensure I’m using the right products for my skin type and condition.

(b) Is happy to see that you’re ready to go at the scheduled time. (c) Wonders what’s taking you so long… only to find you re-organizing the medicine cabinet. What’s on your vanity/bathroom counter right now? (a) Every skin care/ hair care/ makeup/ personal care item ever invented or known to man. (b) The basics… a simple, effective skin care regimen and the necessary hair and beauty products and tools for your low-maintenance style. (c) A carefully followed, intricate system of beauty.

AHA’s and Glycolic Acid will not only provide for a deep cleanse that helps decongest pores, but also acts as a gentle exfoliant that removes any buildup. Gently massage the product into your skin to reveal brighter, radiant skin. And that’s just from within! Brighten . While a good exfoliant does the trick, use the opportunity to take it a step further. Products like our Whitening Mask and Vitamin C Serum are the products that take your skin from just good, to beautiful. Hydrate!

So it seems, but what’s high-maintenance to you, might be nothing to me. I’m always the first to be ready to go out – yes, before the men, too. In under fifteen minutes, I can get skin, hair, makeup, and a clothing change done and dusted. Granted, the finished look is unquestionably minimal and definitely on the natural side. Showers are within the ten-minute range and I don’t do baths. My nails are always freshly painted, but I have yet to actually get a mani/pedi service done. Professional facials are not a regular occurrence (a rarity, actually – I know, I know: shame on me, but my excuse is that I’m a college student. What’s yours?) The list goes on. I’m a minimalist, or so I think – and so I’m told – but am I really a minimalist? Or a minimalist-relatively-speaking ? To those who just splash their face with water and walk out the door, I’m the furthest thing, but when my mostly- au-naturel face is compared alongside a well-coiffed, well-made-up lady, I fall short of putting in any “real effort.” My entire makeup collection – day-to-day makeup as well as all my special occasion tchotchkes – fits into a 1 x 2 drawer with plenty of room to spare, but I’ll admit that each curated piece cost a pretty penny. My skincare regimen is pretty basic, but I’m a sucker for all sorts of body care products. (Lotions and potions, oh my!) There are tweezing rituals, bi-annual haircuts, monthly at-home hair treatment days, massages, and monthly DIY facials. There are supplies to be replenished every two months, and if any of my products should suddenly disappear, yes , I would go out of my way to repurchase them immediately, because I’ve come to believe that I have narrowed down my regimen down to the must-have and can’t-live-withouts. So just how high-maintenance am I? And how high-maintenance are you? Take our quiz! “How High Maintenance Are You?” Quiz 1. How long does it take for you to get ready in the morning? a. Half an hour to 45 minutes, with breakfast. b. About 20 minutes max. c. An hour or more. You’ll pick up coffee and a bagel on the way to work. 2. You can only book one type of beauty-related appointment for the rest of the year. What will you choose? a. Mani/pedi. You’ve learned how to blow-out and cut your hair since you were in high school. b. Haircut. To keep your mane looking healthy, of course. c. Does an all-inclusive spa count? 3. You just got a last-minute invite to one of New York’s biggest soirees of the season. What do you do? a. Start planning. You can book a blow out now and head over if you skip out of work 20 minutes early. Maybe Suzy from your favorite makeup counter at Nordstrom will do your makeup for you on your way home? You’ll get a simple winged liner look and nude mani (fingers crossed) to keep things safe and practical. b. No worries, you’re sure you can pull something together once you’re home. Plus, it’s all about that French je-ne-sais-quoi , right? Just a few touch-ups will do the trick. c. Remind yourself to breathe and frantically make a mental to-do list. Hair. Makeup. Nails. It’s a good thing you just got a spray tan, so at least that’s something… but makeup! Hair! Nails! You can’t possibly plan these things when you don’t know what to wear! It starts at 8 pm? You secretly hate the organizers for only giving you two hours to get all this done. 4. Quick! What’s in your on-the-go makeup bag? a. Powder, kabuki brush, a nude lipstick, a red lipstick (you never know), emery board, lip balm, gloss, liner, a compact mirror, mints. b. Oil-blotting sheets, a rosewater facial spray , a few lip balms , a mini perfume. c. Yesterday’s pink lipstick, today’s nude lip combo, a just-in-case red lipstick, a neutral lip liner, compact foundation, tweezers, cuticle oil, a mini travel brush set, concealer, color corrector, eyeliner pencil… 5. What does your beauty cabinet look like? a. Organized. A shelf for skincare, a couple for makeup. You have some backups of your favorite products and some special occasion things stashed in a separate drawer. b. Clean, simple, minimalist. With some room to spare. c. Cabinet? A collection , more like. The cabinet’s for emergency kits and spare floss. The Container Store is your best friend – your vanity now resembles a little boutique. Results! If you picked mostly… A’s: You’re a beauty girl, for sure. You know your stuff just as well as you unabashedly love it, but when push comes to shove, a few things are just extras you could live without. Maybe not happily, but you’ll make do. B’s: You ooze minimalism. You’ve found what works for you and hey – if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. Easy, natural, but beautiful – that’s your philosophy. C’s: High-maintenance and proud!

The Glycolic action in this toner will encourage cellular turnover and help discourage dull, lackluster skin. Cellufirm Drops This lightweight emulsion contains an anti-aging harmony of Collagen, Hyaluronic Acid, and Vitamin E to help plump and attract moisture and promote smoother, firmer skin. Vitamin C Serum Take advantage of a serum that lends a brighter, more glowing complexion. It is formulated with brightening antioxidant Vitamin C, moisture-retaining Hyaluronic Acid, and skin-firming Collagen. Peptide Renewal Serum Incorporate a serum in your regimen that targets fine lines and wrinkles with the power of Peptides, Botanicals, and powerhouse humectants Hyaluronic Acid and Glycerin. Peptide Renewal Cream Team up our Peptide Renewal Serum with its night cream version, our Peptide Renewal Cream—together with the serum, create the perfect duo to help combat visible signs of aging. Super Collagen Mask Its name speaks for itself: treat your skin to a mask that is made with Collagen to help firm and tighten the skin and Oatmeal and Seaweed Extract to soothe and nourish. Vitamin A-D-E Neck Cream Don’t neglect the neck! Try our Vitamin A-D-E Neck Cream to saturate your neck with nourishing vitamins and hydrating Hyaluronic Acid. For better results, apply over a layer of one of our anti-aging serums. Fruit and Vitamin A & D Hand Cream (SPF-10) Hands are another part of us that gives away our true age, so care for them as well! Treat them to our Fruit and Vitamin A & D Hand Cream SPF 10. As the name indicates, it contains Vitamin A and D to nourish the skin, while Citrus Extracts and Salicylic Acid rejuvenate dull, worn-out looking hands. Oil-Free Moisturizer SPF 30 Your first line of defense against aging is sun protection since Ultraviolet Rays are one of the top causes of premature wrinkling and hyperpigmentation. This oil-free formula promotes hydration while providing broad spectrum UV protection. Check out our other moisturizers that contain superstar anti-aging ingredients such as Collagen, Elastin, Hyaluronic Acid, Ceramides, and Antioxidants: Cellufirm Moisturizer Collagen Moisturizer SPF 15 Hyaluronic Moisturizer SPF 15 Hydrating Moisturizer with Biocare & Hyaluronic Acid Complex Moisturizer with Vitamin E SPF 20 A.H.A. & Ceramide Moisturizer Related posts: 5 Anti-Aging Ingredients For Aging Well Aging well is all about the right ingredients.

The truth is that shaving does not cause the hair to grow back thicker or darker. It simply puts all of the hairs in the same growth cycle, causing them to grow at the same rate, which gives the illusion of a thicker beard. Shaving also blunts the ends of the hair, which can appear lighter due to sun exposure. With the less pigmented ends gone, your hair may appear darker when it grows back in.

Like the saying goes (the paraphrased version, of course) – it’s better to be prepared for an opportunity, and not have one, than not be prepared for an opportunity at all. We get it. Plus, the extra cosmetics bag acts as a supplementary toning exercise throughout the day. (Just be sure to switch shoulders/arms every so often.) We also know that you know how important it is to take care of your skin first; there’s no point to makeup if you don’t have a proper base to start with. And with winter weather that’s not so kind to our skin, it becomes even more important to prepared. You have your wintertime regimen perfected down to every ingredient and purpose – but what if ? What if it’s drier, colder, harsher, etc. than usual? Throw these essentials in your bag and you’ll be ready to face anything: Lip Wax SPF 15 . A must-have that requires no explanation. Chapped lips are no fun. Special Hand Cream with Vitamin E . Martha Stewart loves it, for starters . But that aside, what matters is that winter weather, heaters, and hand-washing dry out your skin. Slather on this rich, non-greasy formula of Vitamin A, E, Wheat Germ Oil and Honey to rehydrate cracked hands. Really – slather it on, as often as you’d like. It may be called a cream, but its lightweight consistency immediately absorbs to leave you and your hands happy as clam. Hydrating Hand Cream . If a classic jar isn’t something you’re after, than another (or additional!) option is our travel-friendly bottle of lotion. It’s just as easily absorbed and nourishing for soft, touchable hands. Rose Hips Nourishing Oil . An absolute star in many a MB staffer’s personal stash. It’s a beautiful, luxurious oil high in antioxidant Vitamin C that’s designed to reduce flakiness and dehydration. Lightweight, easily absorbed, and gentle enough even for sensitive skin, it’s love at first sight. We recommend applying a few drops before your moisturizer for an added boost, but when you’re in a quick pinch and are in dire need to get rid of the flakiness, this is your 9-1-1 response. Orange Protective Cream . Nourish, rehydrate, and protect your skin from the cold! Rejuvenating orange peel extract gives this cream exfoliating power and a fresh, citrus fragrance that makes it a perfect wake-me-up for winter mornings.

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Subtitle":["skin type"],"Title":["Happy 4th Of July!"],"url":"http://blog.mariobadescu.com/skin-type-4/","Text":["It’s time to get your skin prepped for summer, no matter what skin type you have! Amid the festivities of fireworks, hot dogs and red, white and blue everything , let us not forget to protect our skin. If you’re involved in water activities (water balloon fights count!) or perspiring up a storm by simply lounging outside, it is imperative to re-apply sunscreen every two hours to ensure your skin is getting optimum sun protection. However, in the event a burn does strike (heaven forbid), be sure to baby your skin with our After Sun Cooling Gel . It’s enriched with soothing Aloe Vera and cooling Menthol to ease the discomfort of sunburn. Aside from potentially scorched skin, remember that you’ll need to switch up your skin care regimen during the summer based on your skin type . Here’s how: Acne-Prone Skin It’s a myth that sun tanning will clear up breakouts. In fact, the opposite is true: over-exposure to the sun can damage the skin, thereby worsening breakouts in the long run. Help keep breakouts at bay with our Anti-Acne Serum . It contains acne-fighting Salicylic Acid and soothing Thyme Extract, which possesses antibacterial properties. Also, don’t go without this mask duo to encourage a clearer complexion: the Drying Mask and Healing & Soothing Mask . Amp up your ammunition against acne by alternating these two masks week to week. Oily Skin Those with Oily Skin put up with enough shine as it is, let alone in the warmer months. To keep excess oil at bay, add these must-haves to your regimen: Special Mask for Oily Skin Control Moisturizer for Oily Skin (For night; remember that you’ll need sun protection during the day.) Combination Skin Combination skin tends to lean toward the oily side during the summer season, so it may be ideal to slightly tweak your regimen to cater to this temporary shine factor. Swap your daily cleanser for the Botanical Facial Gel two to three days a week to help balance your skin. Moreover, treat your skin once a week to a purifying mask such as our Flower & Tonic Mask or our Orange Tonic Mask . Oh-so-refreshing for summer skin! Dry Skin The blazing heat can actually further dry out parched-skinned folks’ skin. Continue with an appropriate regimen for dry skin, but add the Gingko Mask once a week for extra hydration and nourishment. Aging Skin If you’re experiencing signs of aging, enhance your regimen by applying our Vitamin C Serum underneath your moisturizer every other night. It will encourage a radiant summer glow due to brightening properties from its L-Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C) content. Sensitive Skin Sensitive skinsies need to be a little extra cautious on hot summer days like the fourth of July. In addition to the must-have moisturizer with a built-in sunscreen, be sure to simmer your skin down with our Calma Mask (if your skin is on the oily side) or our Azulene Calming Mask (if your skin is more in the dry zone). While you’ve got your skin type under control, enjoy the barbecues, laughter and sunshine with peace of mind! Related posts: HAPPY FOURTH OF JULY!

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Lee Ann"],"url":"http://blog.mariobadescu.com/combination-skin/","Text":["Some people have skin that’s dry all over while others have super-active sebaceous glands that make the entire face oily. For these people, the trick is finding skin care products right for their skin type and their personal skin conditions, such as acne or sensitivity. Combination skin, on the other hand, offers both the challenges of oily skin AND dry skin as well as any other conditions, including the above-mentioned acne and/or sensitivity. There’s no question, combination skin can be a challenge to deal with. Parts of the face are dry, while other parts are oily ( usually the forehead, nose, and chin, also known as the ‘T-Zone’). It can be confusing and difficult to balance the skin by ‘satisfying’ both the oily and dry parts of the face. [Read: What’s YOUR Skin Type? ] What can be even more challenging is when some parts of the face are very dry while other parts are very oily and slick. In some extreme cases, you may need to use different products on different parts of your face. Check out our suggested, basic regimens for combination skin that may help put an end to your frustrations. Combination/Oily Skin Routine: Enzyme Cleansing Gel , Cucumber Cleansing Lotion (toner), Oil-Free Moisturizer SPF 30 (for day) and A.H.A. & Ceramide Moisturizer (for night). Exfoliate two to three times a week with our Kiwi Face Scrub and use the Flower and Tonic Mask . Combination/Dry Skin Routine: Seaweed Cleansing Soap , Seaweed Cleansing Lotion (toner), Collagen Moisturizer SPF 15 (for day) and Seaweed Night Cream (for night). Exfoliate two nights a week with our Almond & Honey Face Scrub and use the Enzyme Revitalizing Mask . Extreme Combination Skin (very dry, very oily parts) Routine: Enzyme Cleansing Gel , Seaweed Cleansing Lotion (toner), the Rose Hips Nourishing Oil applied to very dry areas only, and then layer the Collagen Moisturizer SPF 15 all over. For night, apply the Rose Hips Nourishing Oil to the dry areas, and the A.H.A. & Ceramide Moisturizer for the rest of the face. Exfoliate twice a week with our Almond & Honey Face Scrub . Two to three times a week, apply the Special Mask for Oily Skin only on oily areas, and apply the Gingko Mask on dry areas. Overcome complicated combo skin now!

If you wear makeup, how soon did they see you bare-faced? There’s a set of milestones every relationship is bound to reach, some traditional and adorable – first Valentine’s Day, first weekend getaway, meeting the parents – and others not quite scrapbook-suitable, but adorable nonetheless – we’ll let you use your imagination for this one. (Everything’s adorable when you’re in love.) Among those rites of passage is the day your significant other sees you bare-faced . No, not with minimal “no-makeup makeup,” but no makeup . It’s far less intimidating if you’re already rocking the au naturel , but it’s still a pretty big step. Take a deep breath and let me tell you a simple truth: Your loved one really isn’t going to care. I promise. Pinky swear. Cross my heart and hope to… If anything your significant other’s going to find it sweet; knowing that you feel comfortable enough to be completely you around him or her is step towards true intimacy, no? That’s just the gateway. The foot in the door. Because next comes the unveiling of the beauty regimens. The five minutes – or hour-long – of the hair routine. Morning regimens and evening wind-downs. And gasp – the magical process of putting on your face (simply speaking) before any sort of event. There’s the base, the strategic contouring, the lashes, the lips… then there are no more secrets. When is it okay to walk around with little pink dots freckling your face? Do you choose between the pimple-erasing magic of the Drying Lotion or feel obligated to suffer the whiteheads because you’re afraid your honey might laugh at your habits? What about the weekly masks ? And the monthly Silver Powder blackhead detox? Is it better to leave a little mystery to the imagination? I’ll have you know that a certain man-friend of mine was not only blasé about the 10 minutes I had Silver Powder swatches across the center of my face, but he also let me use it on him too. (See our guide on How to Get Your Significant Other To Try Your Skincare Products for more tips!) And if I revealed this much, I may as well tell you that yes , he thoroughly enjoyed the process, and was super amazed at the results. He bought a jar for himself, so good things come to those who just continue what they do – your significant other will still love you for you! . . .

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Sara Kosmyna"],"url":"http://blog.mariobadescu.com/skin/","Text":["There is more to your face than cute freckles and dimples, you know. Despite what many people believe, the skin is far more than a simple covering that holds the body together. It’s actually one of the largest organs of the body, constituting a major part of the integumentary system (which protects the body from physical, chemical, thermal, biological and electrical damage). This system also includes the hair, nails and glands. Aside from protecting us from damage, the skin is responsible for preventing excessive mineral loss; helping the body to maintain a steady temperature; assisting in the excretory process; and converting ultraviolet rays into Vitamin D for strong bones. Pretty far from a simple structure, eh? Here are a few quick facts about the skin: Each square inch contains nearly 70 hairs, 100 sebaceous (oil) glands, 650 sweat glands, 80 yards of nerves and 10,000,000 cells. There are three layers to the skin: a. Epidermis (This top layer is the thinnest and contains five individual layers and no blood vessels.) b. Dermis (The tough second layer, the dermis contains two separate layers, including elastic connective tissue, that holds it all together.) c. Subcutaneous (This fatty layer sits beneath the skin and connects to the underlying muscle tissue. It’s responsible for giving the skin a smooth foundation.) Keratin is the protein that makes up the hair, skin and nails. The skin regulates moisture, responds to sensory stimulation like heat, cold, pressure, pleasure and pain and metabolizes and stores fat. This complex structure has the ability to transmit and receive information constantly, and when things inside aren’t functioning properly, one of the first places to show distress is the skin. Moreover, when things are working smoothly, your skin will display a healthy glowing complexion. Treat your skin and your body well, and you will have natural beauty at any age!

But what’s the difference between the two? UVA Rays On average, most people have already been exposed to large amounts of UVA rays throughout their lifetime. Though less intense than UVB rays, UVA rays are 30-50 times more prevalent and are present during all hours of daylight —even on the cloudiest of days—making it necessary to incorporate SPF protection into your daily routine. Wrinkles and sunspots are largely caused by UVA rays . Able to penetrate glass and deep into the skin, these rays speed up the aging process and contribute to (if not initiate) the development of skin cancers. UVB Rays UVB rays cause sunburns and redness. While UVA rays penetrate beyond the superficial layers, UVB rays damage the skin’s surface layers. Their intensity differs depending on time of day, locale, forecast, and season, but still hold potential in causing sun damage. These are the rays responsible for darkness of skin pigmentation, age spots, and tumors that may ultimately evolve into cancer. . . . Any questions? Shoot us an e-mail or ask in the comments below!

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Kimberly Yang"],"url":"http://blog.mariobadescu.com/significant-other/","Text":["Do you wish he or she were more invested in caring for their skin? It might just take a little bit of finagling on your part, but it is possible. We normally don’t support trying to change people, but (let’s face it) good skin care really does change lives! 1. Do it under the guise of a gift. Tasteful? Totally. Sneaky? A tad bit. Everyone knows it’s bad manners to not be appreciative of a present. I bought my boyfriend a skin care set this past Christmas (how romantic, I know – but it was a gift of the heart, promise!), and whether or not he’s lying about enjoying it is irrelevant at this point. He’s using it pretty religiously, which speaks volumes – for that I’d like to claim all responsibility for changing his life in the skin care department. Point is, I gave it to him, and he’s been using it happily since. Yup – it was that simple. But I realize that not everyone’s significant other is as easily persuaded (or easily tricked) into getting into a skin care regimen; I think mine was naturally inclined to given a push in the right direction – he’s quite diligent with grooming habits. Here are a few tips: Give the gift of a set, but don’t overwhelm with too many products. A gift set, served with a kiss or two, works wonders. Give a set with the basics ( cleanser , scrub , mask , moisturizer ) plus a fun extra (for example: a serum ) and your special someone won’t have an excuse to not use the whole thing. Plus, sets tend to have prescribed steps that are easy to follow, so they’re a win-win. Make it interesting. Basics are necessities, but necessities aren’t exactly exciting. My boyfriend was particularly excited about trying this exfoliant packed with ingredients he’s never tried not because it’d be good for his skin, but because it looked cool and smelled good. Aesthetics, scent, and texture are pretty standout, so use those to your advantage. Get them curious about one thing and the rest is cake. Bring on the compliments. “Honey, are you using Product X I gave you for Holiday Y? You look incredible, babe!” All egos like to be stroked. And positive reinforcement always works; just ask Pavlov. 2. Leave your stuff out on the bathroom counter. Curiosity may have killed the cat, but in this case, it’ll have done wonders for your partner’s complexion. There’s two things working for you with this ol’ trick: (1) if it’s there, it’s accessible, and therefore fair game – that’s how most significant others discover what they like; and (2) curiosity is a powerful thing. Little to no work is required for this tip, that’s the beauty of it. 3. Ask for their advice. “Look what I bought today – I’m not sure if I love it yet. Try it, tell me what you think!” This one requires a little more finesse than the aforementioned two, but here’s the secret: it’s human nature to enjoy feeling valuable and needed. Really: you clearly value their opinion, so why not ask for it? Again, getting someone to try something is that foot in the door; the majority of partners admit to becoming loyal users of some sort of beauty and/or skincare product after they’ve tried it once. That’s all it takes: one try. 4. Just go ahead and buy it for them. Number four kinda works like the first and second tip, only this is just you taking charge and coming home with a new set of products laid out on your partner’s side of the bathroom counter. Just do it – it’s as simple as that. Your special someone will thank you later. . . . You’re welcome in advance.

I keep breaking out on one side of my face! I’m doing everything right, so why does this keep happening? A. Acne can be the result of a lot of different elements (as I’m sure you already know). Hormones, genetics, and other out-of-our control issues can lead to acne breakouts. But if you’ve gotten yourself on a good skin care regimen and have your acne almost under control with the exception of one area, there may be other factors at play. I get teased a lot by my friends for insisting that they stop touching their faces. Take some time and observe how your face and hands come in contact. Are you leaning on your hand a lot? Are you touching or aggravating the existing acne and spreading bacteria in that area? Another big thing to watch out for is your phone; make sure to keep your phone as clean as possible by wiping it with an antibacterial wipe often. Two other things—make sure your hair is clean and that you change your pillowcase regularly. Finally, remember that you can treat your breakout-prone area differently than the rest of your face. Go ahead and use the Drying Mask in that one area, even if the rest of your face responds well to the Flower & Tonic Mask . You can also help prevent acne in that particular spot with an anti-acne serum containing Salicylic Acid. Q. I have different types of acne and I’m not really sure which products I need. Help! A. I haven’t always been a skin care specialist, so I can sympathize with the difficulty of choosing products for acne. I have two pieces of good news for you. The first is that our skin care line has a treatment product for every type of acne. The second? We’re going to walk through them right now.

A bit of attention now and then is both well-deserved and much-needed. How else are you supposed to put your best feet forward? You Will Need : bathtub, bucket, sink – anything you don’t mind soaking those tootsies in essential oil (optional) pumice stone and/or foot file Rolling Cream Peel with AHA Elbow & Heel Smoothing Cream lotion or rich cream of your choice ! cotton socks Directions : Fill your tub/sink/bucket with hot water and seat yourself comfortably. Recreate a spa-like atmosphere by dimming the lights and adding a few drops of your favorite essential oil – peppermint, eucalyptus, and lavender are lovely – as you run the water. Sit back, relax, and soak those tired feet for at least five minutes to soften the skin. Slightly wet your pumice stone and begin scrubbing the bottom of your foot. Target the sides (where shoes tend to rub), the back of the heel, the base of the heel, and the ball of your foot. Rub in circular motions to loosen the dead skin and help increase circulation. How much better do your feet feel now? Reach for your foot file or Rolling Cream Peel with AHA to remove all those dry, flaking bits of dead skin before giving your feet a good rinse under warm to hot water. While they’re still damp, massage our rich Elbow & Heel Smoothing Cream on the toughest areas of your feet: the ball of the foot, the sides and your heel. Moisturize the rest with a thick body lotion or cream of your choice like our Vitamin E Body Lotion , taking your time to massage the arch.

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Kimberly Yang"],"url":"http://blog.mariobadescu.com/skincare-in-yourtwenties/","Text":["I’m a recent member of the 20-somethings club (it’s only been a little over a month or so). People say you’re at your prime, my co-workers tell me to take full advantage of my youth, and I not-so-secretly wish I was older. Go figure . But it’s not like I don’t enjoy being in my twenties: I’ve shed the dreadful –teens suffix, for one, and it comes with perks of good skin. Here’s the thing: any breakouts have become an occasional, if rare, thing; they’re carried over from hormonal fluctuations of the teen years. As a whole, however, 20-something skin is young and glowy and fabulous. It’s at its best: skin cells are regenerating at their optimum, cell turnover is at its prime (hence the naturally dewy complexion), and collagen and elastin levels are high (here’s to youth!). Cherish it , they all say. I do. What you once needed isn’t so much relevant anymore – and what’s marketed at you is, well, what exactly? There’s anti-acne for teens, then a jump straight to intensive anti-aging. Where is it that the 20-something fits in? What do you need? Moisturizer (with SPF protection) used in the morning and evening is essential to preventing oil glands from going into overproduction in trying to compensate hydration. Always bring any remaining lotion to your neck area as well. Deep clean regularly . Your main concern is most likely congestion and blackheads. Target those clogged pores with our Glycolic Foaming Cleanser and one of our Cleansing Tonic Masks . Help control oil by toning twice daily after cleansing the skin; toners like our Cucumber Cleansing Lotion help with T-zone shine and refreshing the pores. Start preventing, now . There’s no harm in being a step ahead; our Vitamin C Serum is the perfect starting point for an anti-aging treatment that also tones and brightens complexions. While serums are optional (but highly recommended), eye cream is an essential . Mario Badescu once said: “Every man or woman over the age of 21 should apply an eye cream in the morning and in the evening, as part of the daily routine. There are no exceptions.” Take it to heart. The eye area is delicate and requires moisture; start with a lighter formulation like the Hyaluronic Eye Cream before upgrading to something richer in a few years. Last but not least, always, always apply SPF whenever, wherever. SPF protection is the best preventive measure against signs of aging . Tanned skin may be in right now, but sun damage isn’t and never will be. If you must, see it to believe it . Never underestimate the power or the benefits of regularly using products with SPF protection: it’s always worth it in the end. . . . Are you on Tumblr yet?

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Kimberly Yang"],"url":"http://blog.mariobadescu.com/good-skin/","Text":["… maybe they should teach this alphabet to kids instead? . . . A: Anti-aging . Are you on a quest for good skin? It’s all about prevention. Protect with SPF, always stay hydrated, and nourish the skin with ingredients like Vitamins A, C, E, Collagen, etc. Start with eye cream – MB himself said everyone over the age of 20 should invest in one. B: Breathe . Be sure to de-stress. There’s a saying that goes we wear our hearts on our sleeves ; we say you wear your stress on your skin. It shows. C. Customize . Everyone’s skin is different. Cater the products to your skin type; what works for others may not work for you. Don’t feel obligated to buy all the products from one line – mix and match for the perfect combo! D. Deep clean . One to three times a week, unclog those pores and let your skin breathe . E. Exfoliate . Regular exfoliation stimulates the skin and promotes cell turnover for a brighter and smoother complexion. F. Facials . At home DIY or professionally done , you and your skin both need and deserve it. G. Glycolic Acid . A natural AHA, we love Gycolic Acid because it helps improve texture, fine lines, and discoloration for a healthier and more radiant complexion. H. Hyaluronic Acid . Another favorite ingredient of ours; it helps retain the skin’s natural moisture. I. Increase your water intake . Drink it in! Keep your body and skin hydrated and happy! J. Jog . Walk. Run. Dance. A healthy lifestyle shows. K. Kaolin Clay -based masks absorb all the oil and pore-clogging gunk for a truly good clean. L. Learn to love your skin. M. Moisturize . Twice a day, no matter what your skin type is. N. Narrow it down . It’s important to cover all the essentials, but remember: less is more . O. Organize your skincare routine. Do you need a different day & night routine? Winter & summer regimen? P. Pimples . Acne. Breakouts. They happen to the best of us. Don’t touch or squeeze no matter how tempted you are to pop that sucker – spot treat if it’s an occasional thing, and if it’s a regular occurrence read our guide to how to conquer acne skin . Q. Quiet time . Allot some you time every day, even if it’s just 10 minutes alone. R. Regiment that regimen . Establish one and follow it religiously. The key to good skin doesn’t just require products that work for you – you need to put it into practice. S. Sanitize . Clean hands and tools keep bacteria, oil, and dirt from clogging your pores. Always wash your hands before touching your face. Clean your makeup brushes often. Always use a clean cotton bud or pad. Change your pillow case regularly. T. Tone . Too many people underestimate the importance of toner (or don’t know what it’s for ). It is essential in the cleansing process to help remove any residual makeup and oil. U. UVA/UVB Rays . SPF protection is essential as a preventive measure against premature aging, sun damage, and ultimately, skin cancer. Apply sunscreen often, regardless of the season. V. Vitamin C . A favorite ingredient of the skincare industry and for good reason, too. It’s an antioxidant that helps stimulate collagen formation and boost your block against the sun to help minimize fine lines and discoloration and help promote a more radiant complexion. W. Wait . Before jumping into an entire regimen of new products, test each product on your wrist first to see if you’ll have a negative reaction. If not, introduce products one at a time so you know what works and what doesn’t with your skin. X. Examine . (X was a tough one… think X-amine!) Only a dermatologist can properly determine what it is your skin needs. Y. Yes – say it more often. Be open to possibilities! That, my friends, is a true glow from within that no product can give you. Z. Zero in on problem areas with serums and spot treatments. But remember, there’s no such thing as instant gratification: you need a solid skincare regimen if you want good skin for the long haul. . . .

This rich serum can be applied after moisturizer for drier skin types and worn alone as a night moisturizer for oily or acneic complexions. In addition, its packaging allows for maximum control during dispensing, which makes it easy to spot treat ultra-dry areas. This non-irritating formula is perfect for ALL skin types, so oily guys and gals can get the necessary hydration their complexions crave without clogged pores; dry skin types can hit their skin with moisture and radiance for a gorgeous glow; and acne prone individuals can rest assured that they’re feeding their skin, not their acne.

I have to admit to an almost unhealthy love for the Herbal Hydrating Serum , an oil-free gel that provides the most amazing level of hydration (whether used alone or with a moisturizer). It’s the type of moisture that people with oily or acne-prone skin thought they could never achieve—and yet it works beautifully for all skin types. What could be better? Seriously, though, don’t take my word for it. See what others have to say about the Herbal Hydrating Serum! “I love this product!” says Katie C., “It’s amazing! My skin was dry from using so many harsh acne products, but this serum helped my skin regain its moisture back. It goes on smoothly and my skin has never felt better.” Nakia S. agrees: “The moment you put this on your skin it feels like cool water. It actually seems to feel even more hydrating after its been on your skin a minute or two. This really does what is says. This is great as a refreshing pick-me-up or as a moisturizer when you are oily.” Check out more reviews for the Herbal Hydrating Serum here , and don’t hesitate to let us know what you think of it!

Feel free to check my handbag at any time if you’re so inclined and just see for yourself this summer body lotion. I told you - we love Instagram, didn't you know? It’s like a genie in a bottle, only better. Hydration, shimmer and glow all wrapped up in a delicious, coconut-y scent: could a genie give you that? Probably , but your three wishes would be used up and your genie would be useless at that point. Antique lamp, or Summer Shine Body Lotion? Take your pick. I choose the latter, and not because I mostly don’t believe in magic (my Aladdin -on-replay and Christina Aguilera’s infamous single-on-repeat days are long gone…). If I’ve forgotten to spritz myself with perfume, I have the option of smelling all sorts of summery and tropical. I have access to summer-fying myself whenever . At the height of summer, or in the midst of winter. Glowing legs, highlighted collarbones, shimmering shoulders, you name it, you have it. (Instant gratification can sometimes be a beautiful thing; but when it comes to skincare, patience is a virtue that will be rewarded!) From day to night, from the office to the beach, it becomes that easy to add a bit of oomph . What I love most about it, though, is that it’s the perfect intersection of beauty and skincare , proof that both worlds aren’t so exclusive, and that you need one in order to have the other. Skincare lends itself to more beautiful makeup, and beautiful makeup pushes you to want to invest more in skincare. Call it the circle of life if you will, but two Disney references in one post alone isn’t exactly helping with my desire to come across as older (and therefore wiser). What’s not to love about this summer body lotion? . . . If you had a genie (completely hypothetical, here), what would your three wishes be?

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Subtitle":["Hyperpigmentation"],"Title":["Skin Talk Tuesday: Understanding Hyperpigmentation"],"url":"http://blog.mariobadescu.com/hyperpigmentation-3/","Text":["Hyperpigmentation is a condition characterized by the darkening of the skin. It is caused by the overproduction of melanin . Three types of hyperpigmentation exist: 1. Lentigenes. a. Freckles . Sun (age) spots appear as we get older; freckles appear in youth from overexposure. b. Solar Lentigenes . Better known as sun spots (but also as age or liver spots ), these small, darkened spots of skin are the result of sun damage over time. Sun spots are commonly found on the face, hands, and chest. 2. Melasma . Also commonly known as the “pregnancy mask,” melasma is caused by a combination of hormonal changes – from pregnancy, use of birth control pills, hormone replacement therapy, or thyroid dysfunction – coupled with sun exposure. These dark patches, found on the face and sometimes the abdomen, typically fade away once hormonal balance has been restored (for example, after pregnancy). 3. Post-Inflammatory Hyperpigmentation (PIH) . As its name suggest, PIH is the result of minor skin injuries from acne lesions, burns, cuts, or psoriasis. PIH naturally fades as the skin heals and regenerates itself – it’s a gradual process that last can anywhere from a few months to a year. The good news is that it’s the easiest type of hyperpigmentation to treat. Why It Happens : Genetics . Hyperpigmentation can affect anyone, but there are some individuals who are predisposed to this condition. Those of Asian, African, Latin, and Mediterranean descent are more likely to experience some form of hyperpigmentation. Age . It’s important to understand that hyperpigmentation is not an inevitable outcome of intrinsic aging (the natural aging process). It’s the result of extrinsic aging (aging of the skin caused by external factors) – meaning it’s definitely preventable. Prolonged exposure to sun will trigger excess melanin production and cause hyperpigmentation to become incredibly common in middle-aged (and older) individuals. Melanin distribution becomes less controlled and more irregular, leading to uneven skin tone. Overexposure to sun . UV rays actually trigger melanin production. Sun damage is the number one cause of hyperpigmentation . Hormonal changes . This factor makes it more prevalent in women than men, as hormonally-triggered hyperpigmentation results from pregnancy and birth control side effects. Minor skin injuries . Burns, cuts, post-acne lesions, scratches, etc. may lead to discoloration as the skin begins its healing process. Medication . Be sure to consult your doctor about possible side effects; antibiotics, anti-seizure drugs, and hormone treatments are among some of the factors known to cause hyperpigmentation. What to Do : Exfoliate regularly . Depending on your skin type, gentle scrubs and/or Alpha or Beta Hydroxy Acid based cleansers ( Glycolic Acid and Salicylic Acid , respectively), are proven to be effective at sloughing off dead skin cells and helping encourage cell turnover for brighter, newer, pigment-free skin. Consider Glycolic (or other chemical) peels . Think of these AHA peels as a step up from your AHA-based cleanser. These are highly concentrated and therefore incredibly effective at chemical exfoliation, and are said to be one of the best treatments for stubborn hyperpigmentation. Be sure to consult an aesthetician or dermatologist to see if you are an ideal candidate for these powerful peels. Know your ingredients . Look for skincare products highlighting AHAs (Glycolic Acid, fresh fruit extracts or enzymes), Kojic Acid , Mulberry Extract, and Licorice, all of which have been shown to help brighten and lighten the complexion to promote better skin tone. How to Prevent : Limit sun exposure . And if you can’t avoid it, be sure you’re armed with a brimmed hat and broad spectrum sunscreen, to be reapplied as often as needed. Wear daily SPF protection . Not just on your face – but your neck, chest, and hands too. Two-thirds of all sun damage – which inevitably leads to the formation of age spots – is all incidental, so be sure to protect your skin whenever your step out the door (regardless of weather!).

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Lee Ann"],"url":"http://blog.mariobadescu.com/glycolic-peel/","Text":["Glycolic peels are ideal for those who have the following skin issues: acne, hyperpigmentation, aging skin and a lackluster complexion. A light chemical peel usually requires no downtime but still necessitates extra care. After a peel, the skin is temporarily vulnerable and characterized by dryness and redness (think of the ‘must get worse before it gets better’ phenomenon). Glycolic peels increase photosensitivity; it is crucial to avoid the sun after a peel treatment. Cool Compress To cool and calm the skin post-peel, apply a cool (not cold) compress on the skin for several minutes or intermittently throughout the day on a daily basis until recovery time subsides. You don’t need to use anything from the freezer, but rather a small cotton towel or cloth dampened with cool water. Don’t Pick It is tempting to pick the skin after the peel when your skin starts to flake (which is a normal part of the recovery process). However, don’t pick regardless of how tempting it is because it will only delay the healing process. Avoid the Sun It is best to stay out of the sun completely while you’re recovering from the peel—especially if you have hyperpigmentation (i.e., brown spots). Sun exposure may only aggravate dark spots and may cause even more. Use Soothing and Gentle Skin Care Products It is imperative to use mild and soothing skin care products after a chemical peel. We recommend the following after a Glycolic peel: Cream Soap Chamomile Cleansing Lotion or the Aloe Vera Toner Kera Moist Cream Facial Spray with Aloe, Herbs and Rosewater The next time you get a Glycolic peel, put these tips into practice and you’ll have calmer skin!

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Jill"],"url":"http://blog.mariobadescu.com/skin-care-10/","Text":["Are you stuck in a skin care rut? It happens to the best of us. The truth is, our skin changes with age and with the seasons; we need to alter our skin care regimens accordingly. If you’ve been using the same products for years, but your skin isn’t looking as great as you’d like, it may be time for a change. Check out these 5 signs you’re stuck in a skin care rut: 1. Has it been years since you re-evaluated your skin care routine? What worked for your skin just a few years ago may not be right for your skin today. For example, aging causes the skin to become drier. Pregnancy also causes serious upheaval in your skin. 2. Does your skin seem very dry in the summer, and then turns oily during the warmer months? If so, are you switching up your products with seasonal changes? Using the same products throughout the year is only recommended in climates that remain stable 365 days a year. For places with major temperature and weather changes due to the seasons, it’s necessary to make adjustments as the weather becomes colder or hotter. 3. Do you think you could be doing more to prevent premature aging, but you’re not sure where to start? When it comes to anti-aging, using an eye cream should be your first step. The eyes are generally the first area of the face to age because the skin around the eyes has the fewest oil glands. Another excellent way to help prevent premature aging is by incorporating a serum with powerful anti-aging properties into your skin care routine. [Read: Anti-aging- Where to start ] 4. Is your skin breaking out regularly? Are you using a regimen of products designed to keep it clear? It’s important to address all changes in your skin, including acne. If your skin starts breaking out, it is definitely the time to switch things up; your skin is not likely to clear up on its own without a little help! [Read: How to get clear skin ] 5. You’re using a cleanser/toner/moisturizer/ etc. because they worked so well for your sister/friend/mother/dental hygienist. We love our Enzyme Cleansing Gel . It’s our most popular cleanser and works beautifully for most combination skin types. However, there are people for whom this is the absolute wrong cleanser. Make sure that what you’re using is the best thing for your skin. Take our skin analysis to determine which products are best for your skin!

Use lemons to remove blackheads Are you desperately trying to get rid of blackheads? Here’s one method we really hope you never try: lemon juice. The powers of lemons to reduce blackheads, lighten discoloration, and exfoliate skin are touted throughout the internet. Silver Powder for Blackheads People, hear us : do not believe everything you read on the internet (except for everything you read on this blog, of course!). Pure lemon juice is much too harsh to put directly on your skin; it will compromise your skin’s natural protective barrier against acne-causing bacteria and aging free radicals. Also, it will make your skin more sensitive to sun damage. For blackheads, try an oil-absorbing powder designed to naturally treat blackheads by getting to the basic cause of the problem: pores clogged with excess oil. Our Silver Powder is a favorite for reducing blackheads and soaking up excess oil. 2. Skin should feel tight and squeaky after cleansing. Squeaky skin? Not this again! Even if you have oily skin, you never want your skin to feel tight, dry, or ‘squeaky’ clean after cleansing. Instead, it should feel healthy and soft after you wash, NOT dry or tight. Here’s how to find the perfect cleanser for your skin . Our favorite exfoliant for acne breakouts. 3. Exfoliate acne with a scrub We LOVE facial scrubs (I mean, have you seen our new Botanical Exfoliating Scrub ? Amazing!), but if you’re currently experiencing an acne breakout, chill out with the scrubbing for a moment. Why? Because it will only serve to aggravate acne, exacerbate redness, and potentially tear at acne blemishes. Instead, exfoliate with a chemical exfoliant, like Glycolic Acid. We like to swap out our usual cleanser for the Glycolic Foaming Cleanser twice a week.

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Kimberly Yang"],"url":"http://blog.mariobadescu.com/smooth-skin/","Text":["1. Drink plenty of water . It’s one of the best things you can do for your complexion; in fact, hydration is easily the foundation of good health and a beautiful skin. Water flushes toxins and waste in the body – which would have caused inflammation – and hydrates cells so skin looks plumper, firmer, more radiant . 2. Put a lemon in it . Fresh lemon juice in hot water serves as an incredible detox for the body and skin. Drink it first thing every morning and you’ll see a noticeable difference in the texture and tone of your complexion. 3. Know your skin type . …and tailor your skincare regimen to your needs. Always be gentle with your skin no matter what type you have ( acne -erupted, dry and flaky, oily , sensitive, etc.) because being too harsh will only exacerbate whatever it is you have. The goal is to maintain balance in order to achieve a smoother and more perfect complexion. 4. Eat a balanced diet. You are what you eat, after all. If your body isn’t getting the right nutrients, it shows in your skin. Remember to eat mindfully: think plenty of fresh fruits, vegetables, and other wholesome foods for smooth skin. [Read : Healthy Food for Healthy Skin ] 5. Use sunscreen every day . Broad spectrum SPF protection should be part of your skincare regimen no matter the season: UV rays can penetrate even on the cloudiest and rainiest of days. In fact, sun exposure is the number one reason behind all premature signs of aging like age spots, fine lines, wrinkles, and sagging. Prevent damage by wearing sunscreen daily; avoiding the sun between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. when its rays are the strongest; reapplying sun protection as often as necessary; and avoiding sun bathing and indoor tanning beds. 6. Exfoliate regularly . Bumpy skin can be refined over time with regular exfoliation one to three times a week. An Alpha Hydroxy Acid cleanser (such as our Glycolic Foaming Cleanser ) gives a deep clean by penetrating pores and breaking down dulling buildup – thus encouraging cell turnover for a brighter and noticeably smoother complexion. Be sure to exfoliate your body too. A gentle scrub helps buff away dry, flaky bits so the skin can better absorb whatever body lotion or cream applied afterwards. 7. Moisturize , always . Even oily skin types, too. Hydration is the cornerstone of a healthy, smooth complexion, so be sure to find the right moisturizer for both your face and body to help the epidermis retain proper hydration levels. Apply the product while your skin is still damp – right after cleansing or showering – for optimal results.

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Kimberly Yang"],"url":"http://blog.mariobadescu.com/morning-person/","Text":["Sometimes it’s too cold to get out of bed. Sometimes you had a late night and physically can’t get up until it’s absolutely necessary. Sometimes it’s just too early to get through all the steps. But sometimes you just gotta do what you gotta do. Get up, and put your best face forward. Hitting snooze again might sound tempting, but trust: there’s nothing worse than rushing through your morning routine and feeling less than 100 percent to face the world. Haste makes waste, as the saying goes, and when you’re down to 10 minutes before you have to be out the door, something is bound to get sacrificed. Which will it be this time? Your hair or your outfit? Your breath (hopefully not!) or your face? I’ll tell you this much from personal experience: there have been a few times where I’d given up my skincare regimen in favor of getting somewhere (classes) on time and I always regretted it. Few things are worse than feeling icky and self-conscious: is my face shiny? Can people see these dry spots on face? Will I have aged myself by x amount of years for not wearing my Oil-Free Moisturizer SPF 30 this morning?! There’s a reason why I carry a travel-sized bottle of cleanser in my handbag with me at all times. I’ve since learned to prioritize. I’m not a morning person by any means, but here’s how I make things easier: . . . 1. Turn off all electronics by 9 p.m. the night before . Eight, if I’m feeling virtuous. I’ll be honest: going prehistoric (okay, sans electronics) is pretty difficult, but it makes a world of difference in (1) how fast you fall asleep (2) how well you sleep. There’s a science to it all, but I’ll keep it simple: light stimulates the brain and messes with your natural clock. Put your laptop to sleep, turn your tablets and gadgets off, and put your phone face down. Better yet – try the “Do Not Disturb” (the moon icon, for us Apple lovers) function. It’ll ensure you get through the night without interference. After all, a morning can’t quite get off to a good start without proper rest. What to do for the rest of the night you ask? Sleep – duh! But if you’re a night owl (like me), get out a book or magazine. Let’s do things the old-fashioned way. 2. Put your alarm (your phone, presumably) somewhere else not by your bed . We’re trying to break free of the ol’ hit-snooze-and-sleep routine. You snooze, you lose. How about keeping your phone across the room? It’s cruel (I know), but it works. Come morning, your alarm will be going off – seemingly louder and more annoying by the second – and you’ll be forced to get crawl out of bed and turn it off. And by the time you’re up and walking (or on all fours), you’ll be up. The worst is over. You’re up. Go get ready. 3. Plan the night before. If you can’t tell, half the trick to becoming a morning person (or making mornings less chaotic) is getting stuff done the night before. Some things (like brushing your teeth, washing your face, doing hair/makeup if desired) just have to be done the day of; others don’t have to be. Get the latter done and you won’t be forced to prioritize or sacrifice anything. (Bad breath but presentable; polished makeup but paired with bedhead… we’ve all done it at some point.) Lay out your outfit. Keep a clean mug for coffee or tea on the counter (alongside any necessities: French press, Keurig, tea bag, etc. ). Pack your lunch. Double-check all necessary paperwork and other essentials are tucked into your bag. 4. Get rid of those blackout curtains . Non-natural light when it’s dark out isn’t the best for your circadian rhythm. So, in that same note, man-made darkness isn’t good for your natural body clock, either. Natural light is what tells the body when to sleep and when to wake up. You’ll find that it’s easier to rise when there’s natural light flooding the room… which makes shutting off that alarm that much easier. 5. Focus on refreshing your complexion. In a rush? Keep your beauty regimen simple (but your hygiene routine intact: priorities!). When it comes to skincare, pick and choose what your skin needs most. A clean complexion is a must, but if you’re running out of time, just cleanse , moisturize , and go. Skip toner if you must. No time for pulling your hair back or getting your face wet? We don’t suggest this for every morning, but when push comes to shove, dampen a cotton pad and cleanse using your toner before applying moisturizer. Toner can help give you the refreshing boost you need while getting rid of last night’s excess sebum. 6. Think about products that are double-duty. Broad spectrum moisturizers mean you don’t have to apply moisturizer and sunscreen separately. A dewy complexion is your go-to look, but if you’re running out of time, skip the extra steps where you apply a luminous primer and/or highlighter. Instead, give your complexion a few spritzes of our rosewater facial spray to help set makeup and impart a refreshed, radiant glow. Bedhead looking a little more just-rolled-out-of-bed than je-ne-sais-quoi ? Our Nucleic Hair Rinse not only helps condition locks, but also gives hair a smooth, sleek shine so that it looks a little more pretty and polished. . . . Are you a morning person or a night owl?

She gave us some tips to help my fiancée and I look our best in our wedding pictures! Here goes: First, take a look at your favorite pictures of yourself and try to spot the patterns—do you look best from one side? I know I do! Get to know your best angles and work them. Facing the camera dead-on rarely looks good (unless your face is super-model symmetrical!) Fill in your eyebrows. If your brows are sparse or very light-colored, they’ll end up looking non-exist in your photos. A little extra oomph will help your eyes stand out and will frame your face. Stay away from ‘sparkle.’ It’s not your friend in pictures and will make you look greasy, not luminous. Subtle shimmer to highlight your brow bone and cheekbones are a definite yes . Sparkle shadow/liner/blush? Not so much. Be in lots of pictures. The more photos that are taken of you, the more likely you’ll find some that you like! Face your light source straight-on so it highlights your face and doesn’t create strange shadows. And here’s one piece of advice from us: Mix a bit of the Special Healing Powder into your face powder to help tone down redness and cut shine. You don’t want to have shiny skin in your pictures!

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Subtitle":["father's day"],"Title":["Father’s Day Beauty Lessons"],"url":"http://blog.mariobadescu.com/fathers-day/","Text":["For about as long as I can remember, my dad was, for lack of a better description, “Mr. Mom.” Let me explain: he bought me my first Barbie doll; he sometimes braided my hair; and he bought me my first pair of patent high heels. I loved those shoes; they were shiny, they were chic, and they were most certainly my first glimpse of lady-hood. Enough about shoes. Beyond stressing the significance of a great pair, my dad taught me more about beauty than anyone else. He grew up watching his own mother primp and pamper at her vanity night and day, and what seemed to be idle observation turned out to be useful stuff in the long-run. Who knew that I would be born to a mother who didn’t know the different between mascara and eye liner, much less use the two? [Check out: Father’s Day Gift Ideas ] Thank you, Dad . (I most certainly did not have YouTube during the formative years of my life. To you video-savvy younglings: you’re a lucky, lucky bunch.) Here’s what I learned from my father: Steam, steam, steam . My dad would facilitate my morning routine. Shower, check. Hair wrapped in a towel turban that never fell (this trick I’ve never mastered), check. Teeth brushed, check. Face washed, done and dusted. It was very specific, his methodology: wash with warm water, always. Soak a hand towel in hot water, wring out excess water, and lay it over your face until the towel cools for some steaming action, before finishing with a splash of cold water to tighten those pores. Same goes for the shower . I was always told that the steam was good for my skin, and I believed it as little kids do when adults tell them things. (It’s a good thing, then, that my dad was always right.) Papaya: good for you, good for your skin. And hair, too . My father would regularly whip up a huge glass of papaya smoothie (skim milk or soy milk blended with chunks of fresh papaya, nothing more and nothing less) and insist it was one of the best things I could ever do for myself. Again, I took his word for it because Adult Logic is usually Right Logic in the mind of a seven-year-old and I drank that stuff religiously. (It was good, for the record, so no child was harmed in service of The Greater Good.) Twenty-two year-old me now knows the benefits of papaya are plentiful. For starters, it has more Carotene than most fruits, and when used directly on the skin as a DIY treatment, boasts hydrating, smoothing, softening, and exfoliating properties. Unfortunately, papaya isn’t always in season – that’s where the Papaya Body Lotion comes in handy. Avocado’s another one of the good ones . Avocado smoothies were also commonplace in my home. Any scraps left in the shell would be promptly scooped up and smooshed in my hair or my face. As a neat-freak child this never failed to drive me crazy, but I do remember not being able to stop petting my hair post-mess. . . .

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Jill"],"url":"http://blog.mariobadescu.com/does-coffee-cause-acne/","Text":["I love everything about coffee, including the way it smells and tastes and (most importantly) the way it makes me feel—alive and awake and super-creative. Sadly, I had to stop drinking coffee a few weeks ago because I started having migraine headaches pretty regularly (which is common for me when I’m not careful). And I miss coffee. The upside? My skin looks amazing. Emergency overnight acne treatment Does coffee cause acne? The verdict isn’t completely in on whether or not coffee is bad for your skin. In fact, there are studies demonstrating that coffee is good for your skin. After all, coffee is chock-full of protective antioxidants and lignans, which are known for reducing cancer rates. However, other studies show that coffee might aggravate acne. Here’s how this would work: Coffee stresses out your sympathetic nervous system and triggers the fight-or-flight response. Next, your adrenal glands produce additional stress hormones (this is called hyperadrenalism ), thus accelerating skin’s oil production. You know what happens next—acne breakouts. Coffee is also a diuretic, meaning that it dehydrates your body and may result in premature aging and water-starved, wrinkled skin. Worse, it can also disrupt your normal sleep/ wake cycle—which is all hormonal, by the way. Not getting proper sleep is never good for your complexion. [Read more: does Chocolate cause Acne? ] The added sugar in most commercial coffee drinks is another skin-wrecker. One frozen cappucino from a popular coffee chain contains 105 grams of sugar—which is nearly three times the amount of sugar the American Heart Association (AHA) recommends for adult men. Excess sugar causes body-wide inflammation, thereby exacerbating acne (and causing the skin to prematurely age as the process of inflammation breaks down skin’s collagen and elastin). If you are looking for ways to ‘perk up’ your complexion, try eliminating coffee from your diet and see how your skin likes it! Can’t imagine life without your favorite caffeine fix? Try limiting your intake. Here are some tips that can help modify your coffee and sugar intake and maybe even help you sleep better: Limit yourself to one cup of coffee each morning Take sugar? Start to wean yourself off by reducing the sugar you add by a half a spoonful each week, this will help your palette adjust and reduce your sugar intake Do not drink coffee or any other caffeinated beverages during the 6 hours before bed Take a look at what I’m drinking in the morning now instead of coffee.

Popular OTPs, for example, include: Harry Potter and Hermione Granger ( Harry Potter ); Katniss and Peeta (The Hunger Games ); Rory and Logan ( The Gilmore Girls ); and April and Andy ( Parks and Recreation ). But TV, Schmee-V. Let me tell you about my favorite OTPs, hashtag #relationshipgoals . Drying Mask + Healing and Soothing Mask Why They Work : Ah, the power couple! Call it the Brangelina of skin care products if you will. Together, the two to help achieve a clearer, balanced complexion: the Drying Mask helps to decongest and clarify troubled areas, whereas the Healing and Soothing Mask helps calm any irritation while restoring hydration to skin. Botanical Exfoliating Scrub + Silver Powder Why They Work : Blackheads got you bad? Try this complexion-perfecting combo. Polish away pore-clogging buildup with our ( new! ) Botanical Exfoliating Scrub and follow with a light dusting of our Silver Power to help draw blackheads, excess oil, and other impurities from the skin. Rinse, tone, moisturize, and voila – you’ve got yourself a refreshed complexion. A.H.A. Botanical Body Soap + Special Cleansing Lotion “O” Why They Work : Body acne doesn’t stand a chance with these two in your arsenal. Exfoliating, fresh fruit extracts found in our AHA Botanical Body Soap help refresh and breakdown pore-clogging oil and buildup. Follow with our Special Cleansing Lotion “O” – a unique toner formulated specifically for the chest and back only – to help banish breakouts on the back, chest, and shoulders. Peptide Renewal Cream + Peptide Renewal Serum Why They Work : Our Peptide Renewal Cream & Serum are each formulated with advanced peptides and youth-boosting botanicals to target visible signs of aging like fine lines, wrinkles, uneven skin tone and texture, and loss of elasticity. Each is powerful on their own but paired up, you’ve got the ultimate anti-aging duo that helps recover a firmer, more youthful complexion. . . . What are YOUR One True Pairings?

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Jill"],"url":"http://blog.mariobadescu.com/wedding/","Text":["As temperatures warm up for spring, countless couples prepare to walk down the aisle. Whether you’re the one getting married or you’re a guest, going to a wedding is a great opportunity to showcase your skin looking its clearest and healthiest. Keeping all of the camera flashes and videos in mind, these tips will get your skin in tip-top shape before anyone utters ‘I do!’ Dull complexion It’s actually quite easy to rid yourself of a dull complexion. Men and women sometimes think that simply doing the bare minimum of cleansing and moisturizing is enough, but to truly give the dead skin cells on your face a reason to pack up and leave you should consider giving exfoliation a try. This is especially important for soon-to-be brides and grooms who want to look their most luminous and fresh-faced on the special day. Exfoliating just a couple times per week can make a big difference if dullness is your concern. Scrubs: Take a look at our Kiwi Face Scrub , Strawberry Face Scrub and Almond & Honey Face Scrub . If you’re acne prone and experiencing breakouts, it’s better to try a chemical exfoliant like our Glycolic Foaming Cleanser , once or twice per week if you’re on the DRY side and two to three times per week for OILY skin types. Clogged pores If blackheads feel like the bane of your existence, you’re not alone. Caused by a combination of dead skin cells and oil reacting with the air, blackheads, or comedones , can inhibit an otherwise beautiful complexion by causing sometimes noticeably clogged pores. To help counteract this, consider using a clarifying mask like our Flower & Tonic Mask on a weekly basis in addition to exfoliating regularly to help with pore congestion. For stubborn blackheads, or for complexions with blackheads all over, we recommend Silver Powder . Tired eyes Check those bags at the door! One of the best ways to counteract the effects of sleepy under-eyes that are puffy and tired-looking, is to turn to a high quality eye cream. Our Ceramide Eye Gel features soothing ingredients for ALL skin types, and it can be worn both day and night. Bonus: If your under-eye area craves a cooling sensation, you can put this eye gel in the refrigerator for a few minutes. Puffy eyes, be gone! Chapped lips Smooches in your future? You’ll want to keep your lips soft and smooth from ceremony to reception. Whether you’re a stick person or a jar person ( see our adorable post on this topic ), make sure to have a lip balm on at all times. Eye & Lip Sunscreen is also important at outdoor weddings.

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Kimberly Yang"],"url":"http://blog.mariobadescu.com/shaving-tips/","Text":["1. Do as your barber does. Soak a towel in hot water, wring out all excess water, and press it over the beard area for 30-50 seconds. If you’re running low on time, shave in or right after a hot shower. The heat and steam opens pores and softens the beard, offering a closer shave. 2. Use a pre-shave conditioner . Pre-shave creams, gels and oils help lubricate and protect the skin so that the blade(s) glide over smoothly. 3.Brush away. It’s old school, but it’s a trick that’s lasted through the ages because it works. (Do as dad and pop have always done!) Using a brush to apply shaving cream builds a thicker lather while raising every little hair so you get the closest shave possible. If you don’t shave every day, brush the beard area during that in-between period. Work it in circular motions to stimulate the skin and help prevent ingrown hairs. 4. Remember: going against the grain gets a closer shave, but it’ll irritate your skin more. Try shaving in the direction your hair grows, washing your face, re-lathering, and making a second pass across the grain. 5. Take it easy. Slow and steady wins the race (and the award for best shave, but who’s counting?) 6. Follow up with a good moisturizer . Preferably one with Aloe, Oatmeal or Lavender Extract to help soothe the skin. . . . PS. Enjoy a special holiday treat with our Peppermint Shaving Cream . It’s a great gift idea, too!

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Subtitle":["Young woman in a wheat field"],"Title":["Camping Beauty Tips"],"url":"http://blog.mariobadescu.com/camping/","Text":["This is what camping looks like in my imagination. Is it time to become one with Mother Nature? Whether you’re staying in a modest tent, an oversized RV, or a rustic log cabin, it’s important to keep all bases covered when it comes to your skincare regimen. Though it may seem like a beauty challenge, ( Survivor anyone?) it’s never worth it to compromise the health and appearance of your skin—even if you’re having a blast under the sun or next to the campfire. Adapt your skincare regimen. It’s almost like one of those choose-your-own-adventure books! This can be easy or difficult depending on your circumstances. Sure, at times we take running water for granted, so if you don’t have access to a sink or shower, choose a tissue-off cleanser like our Cleansing Milk with Carnation & Rice Oil . This will ensure that daily grime gets wiped away and your skin will be left clean, never stripped. Remember to also pack a cleansing toner that will take care of any residue left over from the cleansing process. If your skin is on the dry side, the Witch Hazel in our S eaweed Cleansing Lotion will invigorate your skin, keeping it feeling fresh. For those who lean more on the oily side of the spectrum, our Cucumber Cleansing Lotion is a great choice. However, if acne is something you’re battling, the Special Cucumber Lotion is geared toward keeping those breakouts at bay. When it comes to moisturizer , it’s best to think in terms of keeping your skin hydrated AND protected with SPF. Choose a formula created with your skin type in mind to avoid clogged pores or inadequate nourishment. Remember to reapply often to keep your skin protected from the sun. For added benefits, keep your face and body covered with a hat, sunglasses, long sleeves, and pants, when possible. For even more moisture, use a facial spritz like our Facial Spray with Aloe, Herbs and Rosewater . This is also a great way to freshen up when there’s no sink nearby! We all love our beauty routines. While some of us are mascara and lip balm-only types, others prefer a full face of makeup. Preferences aside, choose products that are lightweight and easy to remove. Generally speaking, less is better when it comes to makeup outdoors, so try to avoid wearing any unnecessary items and strive for minimalism. Wash your hair less frequently. To avoid feeling like your hair is weighing down the fun—literally—stick to simple styles like a low ponytail, bun, or braid. If you time your hair washes right, you’ll barely be able to tell. It’s best to start your camping experience with clean hair to give it maximum wearability. You may also decide to pack a dry shampoo to extend the life of your style. Additional items to pack: nail clippers, nail file, bug spray, and lotion to protect against poision ivy, oak and sumac. … Have you ever experienced a beauty emergency while camping?

Personally, I’m not a fan of big, epic resolutions. I am, however, always enthusiastic about making little healthy changes throughout the year. The best part? Good-for-you changes can make a major impact on the appearance of your skin, and you can take your time making them happen. Here are a few resolutions we can get behind: Stop being so self-critical. When it comes to judging appearances, so many of us are a lot easier on others than we are on ourselves. Try to see yourself the way you see your best friend. Would you notice your imperfections first? Or would you focus on the things that make you lovely? Get moving. This resolution is good for your health, your mood, and your skin! Yup, exercise gives you more radiant skin. (Just make sure to rinse sweat off ASAP.) [Read: How sweat affects your skin ] Sleep more. While eight hours of sleep might not be for everybody, you know better than anybody just how much sleep your body actually needs. It’s just so easy to try and get by on less than that, isn’t it? Here’s the thing: your skin (like the rest of your body) regenerates and repairs as you sleep. Getting adequate sleep will do wonders for your complexion and your overall health. [Discover: How sleep keeps skin looking young ] Make healthy dietary choices. While we’re pretty sure it’s not chocolate that’s causing your acne ( although it might be your morning coffee ), it’s certain that some foods and drinks will have a measurably positive effect on your skin. From avocadoes to salmon, check out more skin-friendly foods here . [Learn: C an gratitude make you look better? ] Quit Smoking. Okay, this change isn’t small, it is big and it is epic. I quit smoking years and years ago and discovered that it’s not only totally possible to break the habit, but quitting smoking completely changes your life. You’ll suddenly have more money, you’ll feel healthier, and your skin will look noticeably better. The process of quitting is different for everyone but the potential life extending benefits are universal. There’s nothing to lose!

Your skin’s protective barrier also begins to deplete, leaving your skin more vulnerable to irritation. As I’m sure you know, many acne treatments are pretty drying. Plus, you’re probably concerned about the signs of aging, too, even as it seems as though your acne won’t go away. Fortunately, there are a number of tactics that can help both acne and aging at the same time (thank goodness!). First, evaluate your current skin care and makeup regimen. Are you using any products that could potentially clog your pores, such as a thick, oil-based foundation or super-heavy creams? Hydration is essential, but it can be accomplished without layering on products that might cause acne. Look for lightweight moisturizers and hydrating serums. [Definitely check out: the Herbal Hydrating Serum , which is oil-free and actually layered over your moisturizer] It’s also important not to reflexively use every product that says ‘acne’ on the bottle. For example, the Acne Facial Cleanser may not be the best choice for you, particularly if your skin is on the drier side. Another thing: exfoliation is crucial . Use an Alpha-Hydroxy Acid-based cleanser, which is a great choice for both acne and aging.

She’s literally had them since she was a baby; there is no childhood photo of her that doesn’t include those dark rings. As I’ve mentioned before on this blog , my mom has always been really glamourous in the most carefree way imaginable. However, she is fanatical about eye creams and under-eye concealers. These are her only beauty obsessions. Personally, I think she’s beautiful in a Marion Cotillard-esque way, but she doesn’t seem to agree. If you have the same issue, here’s what you can do about dark under-eye circles: Sleep Try to get a healthy amount of sleep every night. The number of hours needed varies from person-to-person, so discover how much shut-eye you need, and aim to get that much (no more or less!) every night. Hydrate Keep your eye area properly hydrated in order to ensure a smooth canvas for under-eye cream. While some choose to embrace their dark under-eyes (and yes, they can be beautiful, too!), choosing to use concealer means that it’s absolutely essential that you keep the skin free of flakes and dryness with an appropriate eye cream. The Hyaluronic Eye Cream is our most popular (it’s also my favorite!). [Read: How to choose the best eye cream ] De-Puff Reduce eye puffiness with a cold compress OR keep your eye cream in the refrigerator. (Our Ceramide Eye Gel is often used this way.) Doing so constricts blood vessels and helps prevent fluid from building up in the tissues around the eyes. Brighten Certain skin care ingredients—like Vitamin C—help brighten the skin. While most dark under-eye circles are caused by factors (like heredity and environmental factors) that can’t be changed with a topical product, keeping the skin tone bright and even can help illuminate the eye area.

The skin on her other hand, however, was far more even and uniform in tone and texture. The skin was brighter and tighter—definitely more radiant. You see, she had been putting our Vitamin C Serum on one hand only each time she applied it to her face. She was curious to see the difference with her own eyes, and—believe me—the transformation was pretty amazing. There are a few skin care ingredients that I recommend over and over again to people. Vitamin C is a the very top of that list. Here’s what Vitamin C can do: Provide powerful antioxidant protection against free radicals.

Which is why a shift in hormones often leads to an increase in oil production, which sometimes causes an acne breakout. Everything from your P eriod to P regnancy and P uberty can cause this process. Consider them the 3 Ps of hormonal acne! P UBERTY Teenage acne Few people escape puberty without at least a smattering of forehead pimples. As universal an experience as it is, it remains a universally embarrassing problem to have. Fluctuating hormones are, of course, the major cause of teen acne. When hormones are released to trigger the growth and physical changes that transform the body from child to adult, acne is often the result. Teen acne presents the opportunity to start a lifetime of excellent skin care habits. The first step is to start using a full skin care regimen to get acne under control. [Check out our Guide to Teen Skin Care to get started.] PREGNANCY Gestational Acne Many women experience acne during pregnancy due to a boost in oil production related to increased levels of certain hormones. If you have a history of acne, you are more likely to experience it during pregnancy—especially if you normally break out around that ‘time of the month’ The good news is that if you don’t see any breakouts in your first trimester, you’re unlikely to get any during the remaining of your pregnancy. The most important thing to know about pregnancy acne is that there are some ingredients—including Salicylic Acid—which are not safe for you to use at this time. P ERIOD Adult Hormonal Acne We don’t need to tell you that adult acne is often closely related to your monthly cycle. However, for some women the link isn’t always clear. Here’s how to tell if the hormonal fluctuations during your period are causing your adult acne: · Breakouts occur around the same time each month, near ‘that time of the month’ · The location of acne—hormonal breakouts often occur along the jawline and beneath your cheek ones. · Adult hormonal acne is more likely to be cystic. Cystic breakouts are deeper in the skin and can be painful to the touch. [Read more: Discover the best solutions for Cystic Acne ] It’s a good idea to track your cycle and prepare for the days that your skin is more likely to break out.

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Jill"],"url":"http://blog.mariobadescu.com/aging-hands/","Text":["The elbows can be one of the first places that show age. Now that I’m in my mid-30s, there can be no question- my hands simply don’t look the way they used to. When I look at my hands today, they are a visible reminder of how capable I’ve become over the years as an adult- I see my hard work and I see the babies and puppies and hands I’ve held over the years. That being said, I’m still vigilant about doing all that I can to prevent premature aging. Aging is an inevitable part of life, but premature aging of the skin is something we can prevent. To put things into perspective: the sun accounts for up to 90% of premature aging. These signs of visible aging include fine lines, wrinkles, and sagging skin. To encourage your most youthful and vibrant skin for years to come, pay special attention to the following areas where signs of aging can be more noticeable than others: Hands Encourage healthy moisture levels in the skin by wearing gloves to rinse dishes and do yard work. While you wear gloves, give your hands some added hydration by applying a rich hand cream before putting your gloves on. Also, limit contact with harsh soaps that can dry out the skin and sensitize it. For a well-groomed appearance that will keep your hands looking neat and cared for, maintain regular manicures. During the day, hand cream with sun protection is essential if your hands will be exposed to UV rays. In the evening, a few drops of Vitamin C Serum can offer additional antioxidant protection. Feet They may be the closest to the ground, but your tootsies can give away to your true age if they’re not well cared for. To keep your feet in good shape, soak them weekly in warm water with your favorite body wash . Be sure to scrub your feet well, working around the nails and under the free edges. Use a callus file to soften very dry skin. You can also aid in the removal of dull skin by applying a cuticle product with Salicylic Acid , which will help dissolve dead skin cells. Nail polish is a great option to add a youthful burst of color, too. Also, remember to apply sunscreen to the tops of your feet, which can be prone to sunburns and age spots in left unprotected. Neck I’m a firm believer that face products should be called face and neck products. So often, men and women neglect their necks, and years down the line the effects are visible. For best results, extend your skincare regimen down your neck. It’s amazing what a little cleansing and exfoliating can do for that area. Just be very gentle, since this skin can be on the thinner side. Also, remember to moisturize. Even oily skin can use an oil free moisturizer to hydrate without feeling sticky or greasy. Decolletage Sun worshippers see the aging effects of the sun on this area the most. As time wears on, elasticity in the upper chest gives way leading to vertical wrinkles. If you tanned a lot in your youth, sun spots can also be a concern for this area. Prevent further damage by wearing sun protection and applying it often. For increased firmness, look for products aimed at tightening and hydrating the skin. Elbows Notorious for their dry appearance, it’s important to exfoliate and hydrate the elbows to encourage a smoother texture. Try the Elbow & Heel Smoothing Cream.

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Kimberly Yang"],"url":"http://blog.mariobadescu.com/dry-skin-7/","Text":["Your skin is your body’s largest, living organ; it that acts as a barrier between delicate nerve endings and outside forces – making it incredibly sensitive to environmental changes. 1. Dehydration The culprit behind dehydrated skin? Lack of water . Without proper hydration, skin appears dull and sunken, accentuating fine lines, wrinkles, dry patches, and areas of hyperpigmentation. Your solution : Drink your water and eat it too – which means drinking plenty of water throughout the day and keeping your body hydrated by eating fresh fruits and veggies. 2. Weather There are a few factors at play that wreak havoc on our complexions: • Low humidity levels . When temperature drops, humidity levels do too. Dry air leaves skin feeling tight and looking parched. • Indoor heating or Air Conditioning . Cranking up the heat or A/C strips the skin of moisture. • Windy, cold weather . Cold air dries out skin as wind leaves you feeling dry, flaky, and chapped. Your solution : Invest in a humidifier and set it at an ideal of 45% to 55% humidity. Have lip balm and hand cream with you at all times (in a handbag, in your car, at work), and be sure to never leave the house without properly moisturizing. 3. Sun exposure Prolonged exposure to dangerous UV rays can also strip your skin of essential moisture: skin feels dry and tight at best, and burnt at worst. You’re irritating your skin and putting yourself at risk for photoaging and skin cancer. Your solution : You know the drill – protect with a broad spectrum SPF moisturizer from head to toe, making sure not to forget the neck, chest, hands, and feet (if they’re exposed). Re-apply often while you’re out and about. Post sun, rehydrate from tip to toe with a highly emollient moisturizer. 4. Licking your lips Without oil glands to help protect the thin, outer layer of skin, lips are easily prone to feeling dry and chapped. Licking your lips won’t do any good ; enzymes in saliva can actually dry out and break down the skin’s outermost protective barrier as it evaporates. Your solution : Stash every bag, car, drawer, bathroom countertop, and bedside table with your favorite lip balm . 5. Hand sanitizer Hand sanitizer and frequent hand-washing is a must. Unfortunately, keeping germ-free has its costs. Alcohol content in sanitizers can dry out your hands and make nails brittle, and most hand soaps can leave skin parched. Your solution : Switch out your current soap for something milder. A gentle formula – like this one that’s designed with sensitive skin in mind – can thoroughly cleanse without drying out skin. After sanitizing or cleansing, rehydrate with a hand cream to restore and lock in moisture. 6. Hot water We get it: few things feel better than a long, hot shower. But when it comes down to business, hot showers just aren’t good for you . It strips skin of natural protective oils, leaving it tight and dry. Couple hot water with winter air and indoor heating, and you’ll be left feeling uncomfortable and irritated. Your solution : Resist the urge. Always shower with lukewarm water to help prevent drying out or exacerbating irritated, flaky skin. Keep your showers short – five to 10 minutes is all you need to thoroughly cleanse without overdrying skin – and be sure to moisturize from tip to toe immediately. Creams and body lotions are most effective when applied to damp, warm skin. 7. Bar soaps & high-lathering soaps Bar soaps and high-lathering soaps often disrupt the pH levels of skin, stripping the skin of essential moisture and natural oils. Read more about bar soap here . Your solution : Skip the bar soap and instead, choose a cleanser designated for your skin type. (Not sure where to start? Take a look at our ‘ Cleanser Breakdown ’ to help choose your perfect product!) 8. Smoking There’s no doubt that smoking wreaks havoc on skin : the pollution breaks down Vitamin A (necessary for repairing damaged skin tissues), depletes collagen in skin, encourages premature aging, etc. Your solution : Don’t smoke – or try quitting. If not for your health, do it for your skin. 9. Aging Skin produces less oil as we get older; it’s a natural phenomenon to experience drier, thinner skin over time. Your solution : Be diligent with your daily skin care regimen. At the crux of it all, moisturizing is the most important step in effective anti-aging care: invest in moisturizers , protective creams , night creams , and serums to help relieve dryness, smooth fine lines, and plump skin for a more radiant, youthful-looking complexion. 10. Irritants Dry, irritated skin may be the result of direct contact with heavily-fragranced body products, perfumes, detergent, fabric softener, and other household products. Your solution : A product clean-out might be just what you need. Re-evaluate your product (personal and household) labels and if necessary, swap them for milder, gentler, fragrance/detergent/chemical-free formulas. . . .

You actually want your skin to be cool , not warm , before application of sunless tanners. Here’s why: A lot of people think that applying a self-tanner right out of the shower is a good idea. However, this can encourage self-tanner to settle into your pores, making for a spotty, dirty-looking tan. Instead, apply self tanner at room temperature. If you’ve just gotten out of the shower, use a hair dryer set on the ‘cool’ function to chill skin out OR stand in front of a fan (and have a Beyonce moment, if you’re so inclined!). Other tips for the perfect sunless tan: Exfoliate, exfoliate, exfoliate! Try this body scrub or this non-abrasive facial exfoliant .

Some people can get away with washing their hair only semi-regularly while simultaneously avoiding acne breakouts. Once or twice a week is good for them; going no-poo is a viable choice for others. Personally, I have to wash my hair every day, especially in the summer. Not because it will get oily (although it will ), but because I’ve noticed that I almost always have an acne breakout along my hairline if I don’t. If I skip washing it for two days or longer, I’ll break out all over my face. The moral of this story? Figure out how often you really need to wash your hair. If you’re cleaning it every other day, and are able to maintain clear skin, you know where you stand. But If you’re giving your hair a wash every few days, yet you’re consistently breaking out—particularly near the hairline—you might want to reconsider your hair-washing frequency. [Read: Why does your skin break out more on one side of your face? ] Another trick: I sometimes alternate between thoroughly cleansing my hair and only washing the scalp near my hairline. This protects my skin and hair from becoming too dry, especially during the colder months! After washing my hair, I use my all-time favorite conditioner . How often are you washing your hair?

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Subtitle":["eye bags"],"Title":["Got Baggage?"],"url":"http://blog.mariobadescu.com/eye-bags/","Text":["We all do. A part of growing up means acknowledging the baggage we all carry. It doesn’t necessarily mean we have to accept it but it does mean coming to terms with it. Once you face your baggage eye to eye, you can change it. Yes, really. Don’t you ever let eye bags bring you down. It starts at the beginning. Want to minimize darkness, puffiness, and under-eye bags? Drink up and sleep more! Make sure you clock in at least seven to eight hours of sleep every day. Beauty sleep is called that with good reason: it’s about getting the rest your body needs and sleeping the right way . Drink more water . All day, every day. Dehydration and inconsistent sleeping habits (or just plain bad ones) can seriously make you tired. You’ll feel it, sure, but you can bet those bags will get bigger. Not only will your complexion look (depending on your undertones) dull or sallow, but any fine lines, puffiness, and discoloration will be highlighted. Give it a day or two. Is the difference already incredible or what? Other tips and tricks we love for minimizing bags: Stash your eye cream in the fridge . We love our Ceramide Eye Gel and Ceramide Herbal Eye Cream : both are lightweight formulas that hydrate effectively and efficiently. The hit of cold eye cream instantly helps wake up tired eyes and minimize any morning puffiness; plus, these two are easily absorbed and grease-free, making them ideal for wearing under makeup. Make room in the fridge for a metal spoon, too . Why not? If de-puffing is what you’re after, this is sure to further help. Place the back of the spoon gently against your eye and hold still until the spoon no longer feels cold to the touch. Green tea bags and cucumber slices are great, too . Make a morning cuppa’ tea and remove the tea bag once it’s steeped. Let it cool just for a little, squeezing out excess water before placing over your (closed) eye. The warm bag is a little less shocking than the cold spoon trick, but still effective. If you’re craving a little anti-inflammatory action or something more suited for an R&R spa feel rather than a wake-me-up, the cucumber slices will be more your speed. . . .

Acne! Shine! These are things I don’t need more of. Unfortunately, most of our unwise-food decisions affect our skin on a much deeper level than that. What you put in your body is crucial for the health of every part of you—including your appearance. We’ve talked at length about foods that are great for your skin . ( We’ve even shared some favorite recipes! ) Could your food choices be accelerating the aging process? Is it possible your diet is leading to breakouts? Spring clean the contents of your refrigerator! (And, in the meantime, zap blemishes with this tried-and-true acne solution .) But which foods should you avoid?* 1. We’re sad to report that white breads, cake, pasta, and the like cause your body to experience a high glycemic index—and potentially more acne, accelerated aging, and inflammation. The good news? You can still enjoy your favorite carbs. Just be sure to choose/make them with whole grains instead. Whole grains are anti-inflammatory and high in antioxidants. 2. Sugar is another culprit that speeds up the aging process and weakens immunity, thereby making skin less able to fight bacteria. The solution: choose ‘naturally’ sweet foods (fruits) instead of cake and cookies. 3. Fried foods may cause an oil buildup in your body and may trap bacteria, causing you to break out more. Instead: put down the fries and choose snacks wisely. 4. Excess salt can make you look puffy and unhealthy by causing your tissues to swell. It also aggravates acne. Be sure to check the sodium labels on all processed food, and stay away from the salt shaker whenever possible. *Be sure to consult with your doctor regarding any and all dietary changes.

(We’re suckers for all things leafy and green – veggies like kale, romaine, and celery are packed with vitamins and nutrients in addition to boasting high water content). What makes this particular smoothie especially great, however, is the blend of other ingredients featured. There’s turmeric (a powerhouse of antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds); parsley (another rich source of antioxidant nutrients); cayenne (to fight inflammation – which experts believe to be a cause of breakouts and wrinkling!); and much more. . . . LUNCH Fig Zucchini Pasta with Hemp Seed Crumble (via Nutrition Stripped ) We told you we were on a “Nutrition Stripped” kick. Did you hear? Zoodles (zucchini “noodles”) are the new pasta and a good spiralizer is everyone’s best friend. Here’s why we love zucchini, bodily health benefits aside: for starters, zucchini’s high water content hydrates the skin from the inside out, helping to flush out toxins while encouraging a more radiant complexion. Plus, it’s chock full of antioxidant Vitamins A and C – anti-aging powerhouses – as well as manganese, an amino acid essential to collagen formation. Also – keep the end pieces that often get discarded before they go into the spiralizer and save them to help soothe and de-puff eyes, just as you would with cucumber slices. . . . DINNER Hard Boiled Egg and Brussels Sprout Bowl (via Naturally Ella ) If there’s one thing about us here at Mario, it’s that simplicity is king . We like our skincare that way – and our meals too. Why go complicated when you can get everything you need in the all-natural? This hearty meal is both delicious and easy to throw together – all you need is a little time to cook the grain, really – with just a handful of nutritionally dense, antioxidant-packed ingredients. This bowl contains two of our favorite foods: brussels sprout and eggs. Sprouts are highly underrated; they’re actually pretty potent in folic acid (a B vitamin) and antioxidant Vitamin C. Eggs contain choline and lutein, two nutrients that are essential for healthy cell function. Choline helps the body maintain proper B vitamin levels to produce collagen and elastin, and lutein helps prevent aging and free radical damage. . . .

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Jill"],"url":"http://blog.mariobadescu.com/how-often-should-you-wash-your-face/","Text":["It’s the big question— how often should you wash your face? Do you need to wash it less often if it’s very dry? What about acne? Should you be cleansing more often to quell breakouts? Here’s your answer—wash your face twice a day, in the morning and at night. After cleansing, use your toner and then apply moisturizers/night creams/serums/etc. If you become very sweaty during the day, give your skin an extra cleanse. For example, if you went for a run or were outdoors during a heatwave. Remember—bacteria thrives in sweat. This includes p.acnes , the bacterium that causes acne. OILY SKIN However , if your skin is simply extra-oily in the middle of the day, it may be time to look into your a.m. and p.m. routines to see if you’re using the right products to control shine [if you’re experiencing hard-to-control excess shine, read this ]. It shouldn’t be necessary to wash up several times a day. ACNE-PRONE For those of you struggling with acne—it’s not happening because you’re ‘dirty’ and you don’t need to wash your face more often than other people. The key, as always, is simply crafting your skin care regimen to suit your needs (and help treat and prevent breakouts). [Check out: Acne Facial Cleanser ] DRY SKIN Dry skin is a little trickier. You must wash your face at night. The day’s dirt, dead skin cells, pollution, and (for some) makeup can wreak havoc on your complexion if you go to bed without giving your skin a gentle cleansing. Also—why waste the opportunity to apply a hydrating night cream and/or serum? The issue of morning cleansing is where things get divisive. However, if you’re using the correct skin care products for your skin, cleansing twice a day should not cause your face to feel tight and flaky. We say—wash up in the morning, too. If your face is still super-dry after moisturizing, it might be time to re-evaluate your skin care regimen. [Read more: Skin Care for Very Dry Skin ] Related posts: Do I Really Need To Wash My Face?

This is a very common skin care question. In fact, we hear it on a daily basis. The good news is that there are some really good options for helping to fade acne marks—those red marks or spots that are left behind after an acne breakout. These marks are otherwise known as Post Inflammatory Hyperpigmentation (PIH). It’s important to note that there is a difference between acne marks and acne scars . The term ‘acne marks’ refers to the above-mentioned PIH. Acne marks are the red or brown areas of hyperpigmentation caused by inflammation. During the healing process, this inflammation triggers the production of melanin, which darkens the skin. ‘Acne scars’ happen when a serious acne breakout destroys skin tissue. This destroyed tissue is then replaced with too much or too little fibrous tissue as it heals, causing either hypertrophic or keloid scars (which are raised) or atrophic scars (‘ice pick’ scars that are small depressions in the skin). The main difference between these two categories is that marks typically respond well to daily care and skin-brightening strategies; they are often temporary whereas acne scars involve a change in texture and are harder to alleviate. The good news? Many of the strategies that are used to fade acne marks will also help (to some degree) with scarring. Here’s what you’ll want to do to help get rid of scars and marks: If you’re not already, start using a daily sunscreen with a sun protection factor (spf) of at least 15 . Sun exposure is a major way to darken acne marks and other types of hyperpigmentation. Choose skin care products with ingredients designed to brighten up the skin—including Kojic Acid and Licorice Extract. [We recommend: Whitening Mask ] Also, consider using a Vitamin C Serum to help brighten your acne marks. Exfoliate! If you are not currently experiencing an acne breakout, feel free to use an exfoliating scrub. If a scrub is not your thing—or your acne is currently active—choose an exfoliating cleanser with an Alpha Hydroxy Acid (such as glycolic acid), Prevent future acne occurrences by sticking to an anti-acne skin care regimen. The less acne you have, the lower your risk of getting future scarring. [We recommend: Anti-Acne Serum ] Related posts: Acne Scars First things first: acne marks and acne scars are different things.

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Kimberly Yang"],"url":"http://blog.mariobadescu.com/spring-skin/","Text":["We’re leaving winter behind. Every last dull, flaking bit of it. 1. Glycolic’s the name of the game. Bringing life back to lackluster winter starts at the beginning. Your path to radiance starts with our Glycolic Foaming Cleanser . A few times a week, supplement your usual cleanser for this deep-cleaning, exfoliating cleanser to help break down dulling, pore-clogging dead skin cell buildup. What you’re left with is brighter, smoother, more even skin. 2. #Treatyoself. A treatment like our Enzyme Revitalizing Mask can do wonders in delivering intense moisture to post-winter skin. Plus, it’s packed with Alpha Hydroxy Acids, which means spring skin gets a revitalizing boost. Twenty minutes in and you’re already on your way to spring-ready skin. 3. Moisturize, moisturize, moisturize! When you exfoliate regularly ( chemical exfoliants , granular scrubs , or both – take your pick!), you’re allowing your skin to better absorb all the skincare you put on it later. Moisturizers absorb so much more quickly; plus, all the good ingredients get to work more effectively. No buildup, no extra work to get into the skin. Simple, right? Now it’s about choosing the right moisturizer . With warmer weather and more sun (so much yay!), switching to a more lightweight, broad spectrum formula is highly recommended. Leave the heavier stuff for night: skin repairs and regenerates while you sleep, so it’s the perfect time to indulge your skin. Investing in a night cream ensures your skin is getting the right care throughout the evening so you wake up looking – and feeling – brighter, refreshed, and more radiant. Want to learn more about moisturizers? Read this ! 4. Layer up to boost your glow! Your skin care, not your clothes! (Can we get a woot-woot for retiring bulky sweaters and puffy jackets?) It’s the secret to achieving that dewy – never oily – youthful looking glow. When skin is properly hydrated, it’s not just more radiant: skin looks smoother and plumper, which helps minimize the look of fine lines and wrinkles. Boost your glow with these secret weapons: Herbal Hydrating Serum . This versatile, oil-free gel can be used alone (for oily skin types) or layered over day (or night!) moisturizers for an extra kick of hydration. Why it works: Nourishing Ceramides plus rejuvenating Ginseng and Gingko Extracts leave skin soft and hydrated. Rose Hips Nourishing Oil . It’s a step up from our Herbal Hydrating Serum. Though lightweight in formulation, this oil helps provide the skin with intense moisture wherever needed. It’s a great one to tote around if ever you experience pesky flaky bits (around the nose, between the brows, cheeks) that crave hydration. Why It Works: Rose Hips Extract, made from Rose Hips Oil (a natural source of Vitamin C), has a high Linoleic Acid content that helps hydrate skin while delivering antioxidant protection against free radicals. Vitamin C Serum . I’ve waxed poetic about how much I love this stuff . If three years sans break isn’t enough of a testament to why this antioxidant serum is a keeper, let the results speak for themselves. Why It Works: This serum packs all the good stuff. Vitamin C helps brighten uneven skin tone and reduce visible signs of aging; Hyaluronic Acid helps preserve skin’s natural moisture; and Collagen helps plump the complexion for enhanced firmness and elasticity. 5. Still craving even more glow? We won’t stop you. (Dewy skin is always the end game here at Mario.) Here are some of our beauty tricks and tips: Liquid and cream products tend to better mimic (or in some cases, enhance) the skin’s natural glow. There’s nothing like a good radiance-boosting primer and highlighter. Coupled with good skin care, the results are the-bomb-dot-com. A little bit of shimmer and shine never hurt anybody. Our Summer Shine Body Lotion gives you that subtle yet beautiful glow; dab it on your collarbones, shoulders, and down the front of your legs to make all winter drab a thing of yester-year. Keep a bottle of our facial spray . Give your skin an instant boost of hydration whenever, wherever. Hydrated skin is happy skin. And healthy, happy skin glows, glows, glows . . . .

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Jill"],"url":"http://blog.mariobadescu.com/lip-wrinkles/","Text":["A few tips and tricks for reducing the appearance of lip wrinkles: Keep them hydrated- at all times. The last thing I do before bed is to slather on a generous amount of lip balm. (My favorite is our Lip Wax .) It helps keep my lips soft and makes any fine lines less noticeable. Stop smoking. (And stay away from tanning while you’re at it, too.) Here’s how smoking affects the lips. Use lipliner to prevent lipstick bleeding. When your lipstick color bleeds into the fine lines on and around your lips, it exaggerates their appearance. First, apply a hydrating balm to your lips. Then, outline your lips with a neutral shade that matches your lipcolor, and fill in your lips to create a solid base for your lipstick or gloss. Choose all lips colors in neutral or light shades. Darker shades will draw attention to lips wrinkles and makes the lips look smaller.

As a general rule of thumb ( no pun intended ) it’s wise to treat the skin on your body with as much care as you do the skin on your face. Neglecting to incorporate the neck, décolletage and hands into your skin regimen is a common reason why these areas can give away your true age. The following guidelines will keep your hands clean, nourished and protected; your flower bed won’t be the only beautiful thing you cultivate this season. The first step in your hand care regimen is using a quality cleanser. Our Azulene Body Soap is formulated with soothing Chamomile to keep your hands clean and soothed from day to day. It’s even safe for dry, sensitive skin because of its nourishing properties. After cleansing a few times a week, you’ll want to follow up with a quality exfoliant for the body, like our Raspberry Body Scrub ; this will gently slough away dry flakes and dead skin cells on the surface. With extracts of red Raspberry and Papaya, this indulgent scrub smells delicious and works to buff away dull skin from the body. Hydrate, soften and protect your hands with our enriching Fruit and Vitamin A&D Hand Cream SPF 10 . This rejuvenating hand cream contains Vitamins A and D, as well as Lemon Peel Extract, Orange Extract, Collagen, Salicylic Acid and sun protection to awaken the skin on your hands and keep it shielded from the sun’s rays. In the evening, add some Cuticle Cream to the skin around the base of your nails to gently exfoliate the area. Be kind to your hands by wearing gardening gloves. For extra softening, cover your hands in Elasto-Seamollient Hand Cream and put on a pair of plastic gloves inside your gardening mitts. While you work, your hands will be treated with Marine Botanicals, Vitamin E and Peanut Oil which work well to moisturize and protect from dry, cracked or chapped skin.

Herbal Hydrating Serum Treat your skin to this one-of-a-kind serum that is to be applied after a moisturizer and before makeup. This is particularly necessary for those who have dehydrated skin—the Herbal Hydrating Serum is like a drink of water to the skin. It will also aid in smoother makeup application and encourage a more radiant complexion. The Moisture Magnet SPF 15 A popular moisturizer among makeup artists, The Moisture Magnet SPF 15 will prevent dry, flaky, or dehydrated skin and ensure makeup is applied more effortlessly. Hyaluronic Eye Cream The eye area is delicate as it is, but some clients require a little more TLC on their eye area than others. For those who tend to get dry, flaky skin around the eye area, it is highly recommended to use an eye cream on the orbital bone (the area of the face that lies between the under-eye area and the highest part of the cheekbone). This will ensure that concealer is applied more smoothly and the eye area will look more youthful. Summer Shine Body Lotion No look is complete until a little TLC is given to the skin below the neck. Summer Shine Body Lotion softens and hydrates dry skin and imparts a subtle shimmer that will highlight shins, shoulders, and your collarbone. Use all over or just where you need a little glow. These MB products are the perfect addition to any makeup artist kit or the everyday woman’s skin care repertoire!

Especially if you have really harsh lighting in your bathroom or you’re using a magnifying mirror. What do you see? Blackheads and Sebaceous Filaments ( see definition, below ). It’s always really tempting to try to empty all your pores in an attempt to achieve smooth, poreless, perfect skin. For one thing (as I’m sure you’ve discovered), this plan never works. Instead, your skin often ends up looks red and spotchy. Worse, you could easily damage your skin with your fingernails or by squeezing too hard, swapping a temporary problem for a permanent scar. Even when squeezing does make your skin look better, it’s a short-term solution. You’re likely to end up back at square one soon enough. It’s a slippery slope, too: you start by squeezing blackheads and, before you know it, you’ve waged full-on war with your skin, picking and squeezing everything in sight. Instead, make sure you’re taking steps to eliminate blackheads and excess oil the right way, including Eliminating pore-clogging makeup and skin care products. Exfoliating properly. Using a product specifically meant to clear blackheads. [See: Silver Powder ] * Sebaceous filiments are hair-like formations that help facilitate the movement of oil in the lining of the pore. This is a necessary function that helps keep your skin lubricated and protected. For those with more oily skin, sebaceous filaments will be more prominent. The oil in your pores will always return to help replenish your skin’s healthy protective barrier. Related posts: Quiz: How Much Do You Know About Blackheads?

It got us thinking: what would you need, skin-wise, if you were stranded in the arctic? Most people know the basic essentials to bring when you’re stranded in a tropical paradise – some sunscreen and a skin-type appropriate cleanser and toner to combat dryness or oiliness – but what happens when you’re left to fend for yourself in a dramatically cold climate? Here are my top three creative picks for beautiful, blizzard-ready skin that will make vacationers none the wiser to your chilling lifestyle: Self Tanning Lotion Oil Free Let’s just cut to the chase. I’m already quite fair-skinned, but with cold weather and lack of sunlight threatening to make me truly translucent, I would choose this glow-inducing lotion for face and body to emulate the effects of the sun. If you’re not in need of a bottled bronze, swap this product for one of our other enriching moisturizers . Protective Day Cream Wild chills and whipping winds can do quite a bit of damage to the surface of the skin. To stay protected from the elements, this non-greasy formula includes Balsam Peru, which is a soothing botanical that can help protect against irritation. All Purpose Egg Shampoo I know what you’re thinking, and no, you cannot use this all-purpose shampoo to make egg drop soup when you miss the convenience of restaurants. Rather, its versatility lays in the fact that it can be used as both a hair and body cleanser, so it’s the perfect two-in-one for quick travel. Remember, these products would be in addition to the basic cleanser , toner , antioxidant serum , exfoliant and moisturizer I would have smuggled in already. I guess I really can’t choose just three.

(And yes, I go to a lot of baby showers. Diaper cake, anyone?) Here’s what to know about skin care when you’re pregnant: You might get acne for the first time or your usual breakouts might get worse/better. In addition to pregnancy acne, your skin might also get a bit oilier . Also: stretch marks. The younger you are, the more likely you are to experience those. Melasma often occurs during pregnancy as well. It’s also referred to as the ‘mask of pregnancy’ and refers to the darkening of the skin on the face and other areas. This hyperpigmentation is related to the hormonal changes that occur when you’re pregnant; you can help to avoid it by using broad spectrum sun protection every day. [Learn more: Dealing with melasma post-pregnancy ] As with anything else, be sure to discuss with your doctor any medications that you’re taking for your skin. Also, be sure to discuss topical products, many of which have active ingredients that are absorbed into the bloodstream and are not recommended for pregnant women. Salicylic Acid (which is in the aspirin family) is a common acne ingredient that is sometimes not recommended during pregnancy .* If you’re dealing with oiler skin and/or acne, check out our Flower & Tonic Mas k , Drying Cream , and Enzyme Cleansing Gel ! * Of course, discuss these issues with your doctor.

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Kimberly Yang"],"url":"http://blog.mariobadescu.com/nyfw/","Text":["Can’t make it to our Manhattan salon ? It’s okay. Whether it’s post-fashion week insanity, back-to-school stress, or just a need to escape from your busy everyday lives, we’ll always be there for you when you (have the time) and need it most. Skin, however, waits for no one: set aside an hour and a half for yourself and let’s get started. After a week of insanity, it’s time to finally relax with this at-home spa experience! You need it. And deserve it. Shall we? YOU’LL NEED: 1 bathrobe (Terry, jersey, or luxe silk? We say whatever makes you feel like a queen); 1 large bowl; 1 towel; Essential oil (of your choice); 1 large bowl or bucket (whichever you’re okay with sticking your feet into); 1 pumice stone or foot file; Acne Facial Cleanser; Drying Lotion; Buffering Lotion; Azulene Calming Mask; Alpha-Grapefruit Cleansing Lotion; Vitamin C Serum; Seaweed Night Cream; Your favorite eye cream; Elbow & Heel Smoothing Cream; 1 pair of thick cotton socks 1 lush eye mask DIRECTIONS: Kick off those heels! Slip into a sleek little robe and take a deep breath. Close your eyes and slowly roll your head side to side; roll your shoulders backwards, then forwards; slowly lean into a forward bend and into good ol’ downward dog before snaking forward into cobra. (Tell us you don’t feel relaxed already.) Start with a mini facial sauna. You know the drill: heat up enough water to fill that large bowl so it’s hot but not boiling. Add a few drops of your favorite essential oil and play some music (we’re partial to Michael Buble). Then, position yourself so that you’re leaning comfortably over the bowl. Drape a towel over your head to help capture the steam and let the sauna work its magic for 15-20 minutes. Cleanse mind, body, and soul. Or just your complexion (for now). The Acne Facial Cleanser is actually a favorite amongst the MB ladies – not just as a cleanser for acne-prone skin, but for combo-oily skin in need of a refresher. It’s a nice change from the usual Glycolic Foaming Cleanser; Salicylic Acid acts as a similar chemical exfoliant, deep cleaning into pores to reveal a brighter, fresher, smoother – and clearer! – complexion. Did someone say treat? Stress pimples from all those shows and late night parties? Dab a bit of our Drying Lotion onto white heads or raised, red blemishes and apply a thin layer of our Buffering Lotion onto any areas suffering from under-the-skin bumps or hormonal acne. Spot treat is the name of the game: it’ll be like Fashion Week never even happened. Say it with us: ohmmm . To soothe tired, irritated skin in need of love, attention, and hydration, indulge your complexion with our Azulene Calming Mask over the spot treatments. It’s formulated for all skin types and made to help reset stressed or sensitive skin. Leave on for 15-20 minutes.’ … but you can still multitask. While you let the mask do its thing, fill that second large bowl or bucket with warm to hot water (depending on your tolerance level) and soak those tired feet for about 10 minutes. Then, give the balls of your feet and the heels a good scrub with a pumice stone or foot file to get rid of any dry, hard calluses. Tone, refresh, and revive. Rinse the mask off and give the face a final cleanse with our Alpha-Grapefruit Cleansing Lotion . Packed with refreshing Alpha Hydroxy Acids to help gently exfoliate for a brighter complexion, it helps renew Fashion Week skin. Restore the glow. Radiance is the name of the game – and the Vitamin C Serum is our pretty little secret. All you need are a few drops (3-4 will do) before following with the ever-universal Seaweed Night Cream to help lock in moisture without clogging pores. (Remember: your skin is still a little off-kilter from stress and lack of sleep, so what you need is a gentle, non-greasy night cream to help get your skin back on track!) Don’t forget to apply your favorite eye cream . Put your best foot forward. Give your feet a much-needed massage. Slather them up with our incredibly rich Elbow & Heel Smoothing Cream while kneading the Achilles heel, arch, and balls of the foot. When you’re done, slip into a pair of thick, cotton socks for baby-soft feet tomorrow morning. When in bed, do as Sleeping Beauty does . Ballgown and tiara optional, but what we do recommend is a lush, silk eye mask to help you get much-deserved (and much-needed) Zzz’s. . . .

However, there is a major difference between the two common acne-fighting skin care ingredients. Salicylic Acid, derived from the bark of the willow tree, boasts anti-inflammatory properties to help keep acne-prone skin calm while treating the cause of the condition. Benzoyl Peroxide-based acne treatments tend to lead to dryness, peeling, redness, and even swelling—symptoms that most BP users can attest to.

The nails on your dominant hand also grow faster than on your non-dominant appendage.* Scroll down to discover the truth behind those white spots you sometimes get on your nails and to learn why nails-on-a-chalkboard is one of the most-hated noises! Onychopagia is the term for persistent, chronic nail biting. Your nails need to breathe- literally. It’s important to go polish-free occasionally to allow the nails to better fight infection and to prevent them from becoming too dry. White spots on your nails don’t necessarily indicate that you are suffering from a calcium deficiency. Mom might be wrong—white spots on the nails are typically harmless and don’t signify anything in particular. The sound of nails on a chalkboard is incredibly unpleasant for most of us. But why? Anatomy works against us in this case: our ear canals are shaped in such a way that they naturally amplify noises that hit at this particular frequency. Your cuticles serve a real purpose: they help seal in moisture and keep nasty things from the environment (like bacteria) out of the body. The younger you are, the faster your nails will grow. Nail growth speeds up during pregnancy as well. The Ancient Egyptians loved a good manicure. Well, the upper classes did, with the darkest nail colors reserved for the most elite. Your toenails grow a lot more slowly than your fingernails, which definitely explains why it’s so much easier to maintain a pedicure than a manicure!

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Jill"],"url":"http://blog.mariobadescu.com/freckles/","Text":["When I was a little girl, I had a small triangle-shaped constellation of freckles on my nose. I was enormously proud of my freckles, particularly because so many people commented on them and because my sister didn’t have any. This was the 80s, and my mother had a less-than-strict attitude about sun protection. Growing up, we spent our summers getting sunburned and suntanned and we never worried about any of it. Peeling skin was a normal part of summer life; we kept a large bottle of Aloe in the fridge. [ Does foundation protect your skin from the sun? ] Freckles are often quite beautiful and are not necessarily dangerous. These areas of increased melanin (skin pigment) are, however, an indication that the skin has been damaged. As time goes on, skin that’s regularly exposed to the sun will continue to amass freckles as well as sun spots. Worse, freckles represent an increased risk of skin cancer.* [Read more: How To Reverse Sun Damage ] At this point, we think it goes without saying that you should be using daily broad spectrum sun protection, and not just for beach days. To deal with unwanted freckles as well as sun spots and other types of hyperpigmentation (melasma, for example), look for the following ingredients in your skin care products: · Alpha-Hydroxy Acids, such as Glycolic Acid [Check out the Glycolic Foaming Cleanser ] · Vitamin C [ Vitamin C Serum ] · Kojic Acid [ Whitening Mask ] · Licorice Extract [Also found in the Whitening Mask ] Vitamin C is excellent for fading areas of hyperpigmentation. *Be sure to consult with your doctor if any freckles, sun spots, or areas of hyperpigmentation change in color, size, or shape.

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Kimberly Yang"],"url":"http://blog.mariobadescu.com/shaving-2/","Text":["Deciding to use a straight razor is perhaps as deep as male grooming gets these days, but way back when, shaving was a ritualistic practice and rite of passage. Let’s go back in time, shall we? Ancient Egyptians were all about the facial hair until the Dynastic Period. At some point, they decided that facial and body hair were uncivilized and animalistic. Thus, in the spirit of new-found sophistication (and a desire to look more civilized), men shaved head to toe. It was a daily regimen; appearing unshaven symbolized low social ranking. Baby smooth was the goal for the Ancient Egyptians, but royalty were allowed small, well-trimmed goatees. Did you know…? Kings were buried with a barber and their trusty razor so he could go into the afterlife clean-shaven. Ancient Greeks , however, believed that beards represented a man’s masculinity and wisdom. Trimming was optional, but highly discouraged: in other words, the bushier, the better. The only time a beard would meet a blade was in times of mourning. It’s safe to say that Aristotle never had to worry about razor bumps and burns or ingrown hairs. Or shaving cream at that. Lucky chap. Did you know…? Cutting another man’s beard was a punishable crime (and getting de-bearded was the greatest shame a man could ever endure). Pursuing a career as a barber was certainly not in anyone’s future. Ancient Romans , in a collective effort to do whatever the Greeks didn’t do, hailed the clean-shaven look. They were the compromise between the Egyptians and Greeks – not quite baby-smooth, but definitely never overgrown. A boy’s first shave was an elaborate celebration; rather than shave in privacy of his own accord, it was a ceremonial ritual with quite the public viewing. Did you know…? Boys would rub olive oil on their face in an attempt to grow a beard faster (and thicker) for that first ceremonial shave. . . . Gents, we’re curious: what’s your grooming regimen look like?

As a writer, I spend most of my days plugging away at the keys and making handwritten lists. I’ve always prided myself in having well-manicured nails, but as a cosmetologist I know that cuticle cutting can potentially cause dry, cracked or damaged skin- thereby creating an entryway for fungi and bacteria. (Gross!) Rather than take a chance, I keep my cuticles maintained with the right exfoliating moisturizer. Hallelujah, for hand care! Cuticle Cream helps to heal unattractive torn cuticles by harnessing the power of Salicylic Acid for gentle exfoliation. Since this cream is super emollient, you don’t need to use much. I take a very small amount and apply it around the base of my nails. Then I let it work its magic overnight or during the day. To keep your hands—and sheets—protected in the evening, I recommend wearing a pair of beauty gloves to sleep. My tips for fresh-looking cuticles and strong nails: Avoid using your nails as tools. Don’t pick at the skin around your fingertips. File your nails (in one direction) to a manageable length. Use a base- and top-coat with colored nail polish.

If you’re going to wear head-to-toe green, you may as well commit to the theme.* . . . It’s no secret that we love all things green – green foods , green things , green skin care – so you can only imagine that St. Patrick’s Day holds a special place in our hearts. (Keep up with our #seeinggreen moodboard for all sorts of daily inspiration!) This St. Paddy’s Day, we’re about full commitment. After all, if you’re going to wear head-to-toe green, you may as well go all out with the theme. We’re talking from the bottom up, from the inside out. First, a green smoothie to start, then some green skincare to prep: Enzyme Cleansing Gel Our #1 best-selling daily cleanser . This gentle, refreshing formula is the reason for its enduring popularity: it deep cleans to reveal flawlessly fresh skin – without ever overdrying. Cucumber Cleansing Lotion You guys – it finally feels like spring. (Hellooo, 50-degree weather!) Warmer weather tends to call for a shift in skin care ; for most, it means dialing down the emollients and upping the ante on pore-clogging oil control. Our refreshing toner gives instant T-zone shine control as Cucumber Extract revitalizes to keep excess oil and breakouts at bay. Aloe Moisturizer SPF 15 Looking for a lightweight, oil-free alternative to your winter moisturizer? Our Aloe Moisturizer SPF 15 ticks all the boxes in addition to offering broad spectrum protection against damaging free radicals ( more sun, more SPF! ). This one’s a good one to keep on hand if you’re acne-prone or experience oily skin. Ceramide Eye Gel Another warm weather favorite . The Ceramide Eye Gel is our most lightweight eye cream formulation, providing greaseless hydration that refreshes, nourishes, and softens the under-eyes. It’s especially perfect for hotter days or if you want something that instantly absorbs into skin for a shine-free finish. (You know, if you’re contemplating donning green face-paint for the parade…) Cellufirm Drops Anti-aging goes green too. Perfect for use over your daily moisturizer or as an overnight treatment, our Cellufirm Drops features a host of ingredients to help firm, tighten, and smooth aging skin. It’s got antioxidants to protect, Collagen and Elastin to plump, and Hyaluronic Acid to lock in essential hydration. Kiwi Face Scrub It’s all about refreshing the complexion this St. Paddy’s Day (and upcoming spring). Our face exfoliant is made with real Kiwi seeds to help buff away pore-clogging and dulling buildup to reveal your most radiant complexion yet. (Beauty tip: Wearing a face full of green paint? Keep this scrub on hand to help thoroughly cleanse your skin after a day of celebrations.) Protein After Shave Moisturizer Perfect for men and women both, our After Shave Moisturizer provides just-shaved skin with essential, non-greasy hydration.

The term photoaging (also known as dermatoheliosis ) refers to changes in the skin caused by exposure to the sun. We can all spot the signs of sun damage—including areas of hyperpigmentation, loss of elasticity, and age spots. Other symptoms of sun damage include red and scaly spots on the skin called actinic keratosis as well as areas where we actually lose pigmentation ( dyspigmentation ).

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Jill"],"url":"http://blog.mariobadescu.com/how-to-get-rid-of-whiteheads/","Text":["Have you ever noticed how whiteheads tend to crop up at the worst possible moments? The day before prom or right before a big date? WHY? These sudden acne breakouts are probably related to stress and hormones. While scientists aren’t completely certain why this happens, they know that acne is worsened during times of heightened anxiety. Whatever the cause, you usually want to get rid of whiteheads right away. Here’s how: Don’t touch your face. Seriously. No picking, popping, or squeezing. I’ve noticed that people who approve of whitehead-popping usually say the same thing: “It’s fine, I always do this .” They’re always doing it because picking at your skin, and squeezing at whiteheads, often causes the problem to multiply. The act of popping a whitehead opens your skin to infection and drives dirt, oil, and bacteria deeper in. This is one of the reasons that acne breakouts tend to occur in the same spot, over and over. [Read more: How to stop picking at acne ] Prevent Breakouts. If your skin is breaking out with some regularity, you may need to revisit your skin care regimen. Or you may be missing some crucial step—like exfoliating—that could make all the difference. Preventive maintenance, such as using an anti-acne serum , may also be in order right before a very stressful or important event. You know, like your wedding . (By the way, we’re always here to help you tweak your regimen. You can visit our site for Live Chat help 9-5pm EST or call us at 800.223.3728) Use a Spot Treatment. Your skin repairs itself while you sleep. Give it a boost (and put an end to your whitehead) with a spot treatment specifically designed to try up these types of acne breakouts. The Drying Lotion (our whitehead spot treatment) uses Sulfur and Salicylic Acid to help dry up whiteheads while Calamine helps relieve redness. Related posts: Q&A: Whiteheads Vs.

Good news: it’s not! There’s a really popular misconception that wearing foundation clogs your pores and ages your skin. Some believe that it’s necessary to allow your skin to ‘breathe’ throughout the day, unhampered by damaging foundations.* Here’s the truth: Should you choose to wear foundation, you’re not harming your skin and it’s likely you’re actually helping it. Foundation provides an additional physical barrier against the sun, pollution, and free radical damage. Of course, it’s important to use the right type of foundation for your skin. If you’re using a heavy, oil-based foundation on oily, acne-prone skin, it will likely clog your pores and cause breakouts. [Read more: Our secret for perfect foundation application ] It’s also absolutely essential that you wash your makeup off at the end of the day. Your skin has been battling against a lot of nasty elements throughout the day, including the aforementioned pollution and free radicals. Be sure not to go to bed with the day’s residue still on your skin.

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Kimberly Yang"],"url":"http://blog.mariobadescu.com/serums/","Text":["1. Serums are a supplement . …so don’t go ditching your moisturizer any time soon. Unless you’re very oily (in which case a water-based, hydrating serum is all you need), a serum should supplement your daily moisturizing regimen. They’re formulated to penetrate deeply into the skin in order to deliver key, active ingredients to help treat specific concerns. A moisturizer applied on top helps keep the skin hydrated, acting as a protective barrier between the epidermis and the environment. 2. Serums are specially formulated to better penetrate the skin . Serums have a far thinner consistency than moisturizers – typically gel or water-like in texture – because they’re formulated sans occlusive ingredients or thickening agents found in creams and moisturizers. Most of the fluid is eliminated, so serums are highly concentrated with active ingredients. These smaller molecules allow serums to penetrate the skin deeper, thus efficiently delivering active ingredients for maximum benefits. 3. Serums should be applied first . After cleansing and toning the skin, one to four drops (depending on each serum’s respective directions) should be gently massaged into damp skin. Give the skin a few moments to absorb the product before following with a moisturizer or night cream. 4. Be aware of a serum’s shelf life after its first use. There’s a reason why most serums are housed in tinted, glass bottles. The packaging helps maintain the integrity of active ingredients, so to get the most out of your serum, store it in a cool, dark place and be sure to cap tightly after each use. 5. Serums are able to target specific concerns. It all circles back to the active ingredients: because serums are so highly concentrated with hero ingredients ( Vitamin C, Peptides , etc. ), specific concerns are more efficiently and effectively targeted. These tiny molecules absorb quickly and deeply into the skin for fortified benefits. . . . Click HERE to shop our line of serums. Need help picking the right one for your skin?

Dearest Vitamin C Serum , Girl, you are an INSPIRATION! How do you do it, brightening up every face in the room just like that ? I don’t know what it is, but it’s pretty magical. I can’t help but want to hang around you all the time – you’re an incredible influence and me and my complexion. What used to be dull and lackluster has been revived and renewed. You’ve changed my perspective: the future’s looking pretty radiant from where I’m standing. Thanks for making me feel that much better about everything. I’d say more, but I think you may have gotten the gist of how I feel here . xo, Kim . . . My fluffy bathrobe, wherever you are: I can’t believe I lost you. I could make all the excuses in the world – you were camouflaged by the pile of hotel terry cloth towels; why’d you have to be the same shade of cream? I was in such a rush to make the early checkout time; I was late for a meeting! – but the truth of the matter is that I was the one who left you behind when you’ve been nothing but good to me. I’ve yet to replace you; none I’ve met have been as warm or fluffy or perfectly off-white as you. Instead, I’ve been forced to face the consequences. I’m reminded of my carelessness every time I step out of the shower and freeze (it’s a brutal winter this year), or have my clothing splashed with soap/water/cleanser/ something twice daily, morning and evening. No DIY facial feels as self-pampering or luxurious as they used to with you. I mean, who does spa night without a bathrobe? I’m sorry. Kim . . . Dear Oil Free Moisturizer SPF 17 , Phew , what a long name. I have to admit – if we were to judge a book by its cover, I’d come to exactly one conclusion about you: you’re just not that exciting. Straightforward and minimalist and delivering exactly what you claim to d0. You’re the stuff girls dream about; how often is it that we get exactly what we crave? No funny business, no gimmicks: just you, me, and my very, very happy complexion. You see, before you came into my life I was terrified of commitment. (In fact, I never used moisturizer before you – that’s how scared I was.) But you were just so calm, so unassuming, so patient. Even through dry, rough patches and angry breakouts you were steadfast and true. You stood up for me on even the sunniest of days; you were my foundation no matter what I did or wore over you. Hey, OFM SPF 17, I love you. Will you move into my beauty drawer permanently? Anxiously awaiting your answer, Kim (P.S.: Can we just keep things easy and call you BAE? Thanks!) . . . Hey, Drying Mask – I’ve had my first nasty breakout breakup in months since we last hung out. It wasn’t until I was two days into feeling super self-conscious (yet stubbornly anti-concealer) that I suddenly remembered just how incredible you are at fixing these kinds of things. I saw the empty container on my bathroom countertop; I’d used you down to every last bit. There was maybe one crusty speck left at the bottom of the jar, a reminder of just how good you were to me. Are you free later? Where should I pick you up (is it more convenient for you here or here ?) This breakout’s a bit of a messy one, but I trust that you’ll help dry those tears and heal those blemishes ‘til I’m feeling every bit clear of heart of and mind.

You could, theoretically, use a night cream during the day. However, if you’re planning on leaving the house, it’ essential that you use a moisturizer with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 15. Night creams are also formulated to help hydrate the skin while you sleep. As such, they are often richer than moisturizers designed for daytime use, and may make your skin appear shiny during the day. If you’re in need of a very hydrating daytime moisturizer for extremely dry skin, you’ll want to use a separate, richly emollient moisturizer that contains sunscreen.

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Jill"],"url":"http://blog.mariobadescu.com/cleanser-6/","Text":["1. People have been washing their bodies and faces for a long time. In fact, ancient Egyptians and Babylonians cleansed using animal oils and salts. 2. Other cultures linked cleanliness with social standing, and washing up was often done in public places during the time of ancient Romans and Turks. Cleansing has since evolved to become a private activity done twice a day (preferably). 3. Using ‘cold cream’ as a makeup remover and cleanser was overwhelmingly popular until the 1950s, when washing one’s face with bar soap became ‘the thing.’ 4. Unfortunately, bar soap has a pH of about 9 to 10 whereas your face’s pH rests around 4.7. Using bar soap to cleanse your skin can disrupt the balance of its natural protective barrier, making it more vulnerable, particularly to dryness and the overgrowth of certain types of bacteria (including the kind that causes acne). 5. Cream cleansers are best for dry, sensitive skin. These help to keep the skin clean without drying it out or causing irritation. [We recommend: Cream Soap ] 6. Cleansers can do double-duty as acne fighters or exfoliants. For example, a cleanser with Salicylic Acid is an important part of an acne-fighting skin care regimen. Glycolic Acid is an Alpha Hydroxy Acid that, when added to cleansers (or gels or other skin care products), works to help dissolve dead skin cells. 7. Those with very oily skin can benefit from using a cleanser specifically developed for them. To help fight shine and excess oil production, choose a water-based, foaming cleanser. [We recommend: Botanical Facial Gel ] 8. Washing your face twice a day is generally recommended. However, if you’ve been to the gym and/or have been sweating quite a bit, an extra cleanse is likely in order. Follow up with toner and moisturizer . 9. It’s important to wash your hands before you cleanse your face! Always pull hair away from your skin and be sure to use tepid (neither hot nor cold) water.

Plump skin is the goal here, but tight and itchy? Not so much. If your skin is in need of a boost in moisture and glow, add this recipe to your Friday night repertoire. Slip into your robe, have Spotify set at your favorite playlist, light a few candles—whatever suits your fancy, really—and treat you and your skin to a good drink. Make this a well-deserved R&R session if you’re staying in, and if you’re willing to brave the cold for an evening out on the town, let this be your prep for flawless makeup from application to finish. Bottom’s up!

It’s perfect for sensitive or dull, tired skin in restoring moisture for a healthy, plump complexion. We’re all about antioxidant Vitamin C for its brightening properties—and this mask is chock full of it. You’ve got 20 minutes all to yourself . Put down your phone, resist answering work emails, and relax . Mist like you mean it . Once your mask has dried, give your complexion a liberal misting of Facial Spray with Aloe, Herbs and Rosewater . It’ll help soften the mask to ease the removal process and prevent tugging at your skin. Rinse well with warm water and follow with, once again, your favorite toner . Take a good look in the mirror—this step is indisputably the most important of them all—and admire your skin for a few moments. Soft, supple, plump, and with a dewy glow to boot. Brighten and replenish . Start by massaging a few drops of the Hyaluronic Emulsion with Vitamin C into the skin. Any skincare expert or bona fide junkie will rave on endlessly about the benefits of Hyaluronic Acid and Vitamin C. Add Collagen to the mix and you have yourself an incredibly nourishing, nutrient-rich serum that helps restore skin’s natural moisture, improve clarity, and brighten the skin. Are you headed out? Pat on your go-to moisturizer and start the second phase of the beautification process. We recommend a creamy, skin-smoothing formula like our Honey Moisturizer .

Pat 1-2 drops of Cellufirm Drops around the eye area before applying your eye cream. In need of something even richer (especially for nighttime)?

Oily, troubled skin? Try this : DRYING MASK + HEALING & SOOTHING MASK This dynamic duo is a perfect case study of why opposites attract. Drying Mask targets existing breakouts to clarify angry, acne-prone skin, and Healing & Soothing Mask works to restore essential hydration and comfort compromised skin. When paired together, the two masks help keep skin in check—encouraging a clearer, healthier-looking complexion. How to use them together : Start with clean skin. Apply a thin, even layer of Drying Mask on breakouts or acne-prone areas only. Wait 15-20 minutes for the mask to dry, then rinse thoroughly with warm water and follow with your targeted treatments or Anti-Acne Serum . Use Healing & Soothing Mask the day after to restore balance to your skin. . . . Congested skin? Try this : BOTANICAL EXFOLIATING SCRUB + SILVER POWDER Keep skin clear with this blackhead-busting combo. Botanical Exfoliating Scrub gently buffs away all the dead skin cells, excess oil, and surface impurities so Silver Powder can work even more effectively at purifying pores. How to use them together : Gently massage Botanical Exfoliating Scrub in circles all over (except the eye area, of course!) for 30 seconds, then rinse. Dampen a cotton ball or pad, dip it directly into the Silver Powder, and press the paste to congested areas (like your T-zone). Let it dry for 5-8 minutes, then remove with your favorite toner . #MBSkinTip : Save 15% when you grab our Polish & Purify kit—which includes Botanical Exfoliating Scrub and Silver Powder, both full-size! . . .

(To be fair, I first learned of this #MBSkinTip from our PR & Marketing Director and it has since changed by travel skincare game .) You’ve got Herbal Hydrating Serum , a super lightweight, water-based gel that gives skin a dewy glow. Then there’s Rose Hips Nourishing Oil , a Rosehip-infused facial oil that absorbs quickly into the skin to instantly replenish dry areas and add radiance to dehydrated skin. Both are gorgeous formulas on their own—but together? Magic. How to use them together : The beauty of this combo lies in its ability to be fully customizable to your skin. Mix them together and you create a lightweight, hydrating serum that you can wear alone or layer with your favorite moisturizers or face creams. Feeling a little dehydrated? Add a drop of Rose Hips Nourishing Oil to Herbal Hydrating Serum and pat it on any dry patches. Skin looking dry as the Sahara desert? Mix equal parts of both (or more of the oil) and apply all over, then follow with your favorite face cream. . . . Dry or mature skin? Try this : PEPTIDE RENEWAL SERUM + PEPTIDE RENEWAL CREAM Products that were formulated together, stay together.

If you have oily skin … Try our Eye Make-Up Remover Gel (Non-Oily) . This non-greasy makeup remover has a unique, gel-like texture that’s lightweight on skin and never leaves behind a slick residue.

If memory (and Abby Lee Miller) serves me right, it’s just about nearing recital season which means extra rehearsals, long hours, sweaty practices, stress-inducing quick-changes and run-throughs… Now is when a nerve-wracking pimple just might crop up. Hormonal breakouts , hours of non-stop sweating , and stress on top of it all is a recipe for potential disaster. But before you freak, take a breath. Breakouts are the last thing you should worry about (focus on remembering choreography or finding your center mid-fouettés instead!) pre-performance; just keep these spot treatments on hand so you can hit the stage with utmost confidence.

Lightly dust over your finished face to lock makeup into place, or mix a small amount into your favorite face powder for some lightweight but effective oil control. . . .

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Subtitle":["Neck Cream"],"Title":["5 Reasons I Love Vitamin ADE Neck Cream"],"url":"http://blog.mariobadescu.com/5-reasons-i-love-neck-cream/","Text":["Face wash is for everyone, eye cream is akin to a 200-level course, but keep a jar of Vitamin A-D-E Neck Cream on hand and you are earning a master’s in good skin. Here are 5 reasons this neck cream is worth the extra step. Oh, what a lovely neck you have! 1. It contains antioxidants. These are substances that help protect skin by blocking or repairing the damage due to factors that include exposure to the sun’s rays, pollution, and chronological aging. 2. It provides moisture. Hydrated skin looks healthy, vibrant, and yes, youthful. It seems so simple but you might be surprised at what a big difference keeping your skin properly hydrated makes. 3. It contains Hyaluronic Acid. Do you have a tendency to seek out products that contain certain ingredients? I do. When I see hyaluronic acid on a moisturizer or eye cream label, I’m all in. Without getting too scientific, you can think of this ingredient as a magnet for moisture. By binding moisture to the skin, hyaluronic acid is credited with having the ability increase skin’s moisture levels and reduce the appearance of fine lines. 4. It is part of one of my favorite skin “recipes.” When it comes to skin care 1+1 doesn’t always equal 2. When you pair the right products 1+1= magic! Such is the case when you with Mario Badescu Cellufirm Drops and Vitamin A-D-E Neck Cream . First apply a thin layer of Cellufirm Drops to the neck and décolletage, follow with Vitamin A-D-E Neck Cream . I love how my skin looks after using this combo regularly for a week or so. 5. When I have a jar handy I take better care of my skin overall. Someone once told me that you should pay just as much attention to any skin on your body that is exposed to the sun as you do to your face. This advice makes perfect sense. Not taking care of anything but our face is why our neck, chest, and hands are usually what gives our age away. Having a jar of Vitamin A-D-E Neck Cream on my bathroom counter reminds me to extend my face care regimen to the exposed skin below my chin. It sets off the inertia that leads me to use my cleanser, toner, and serum on my neck and décolletage also. Over time I’ve noticed a visible effect on the look and feel of my skin.

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Kimberly Yang"],"url":"http://blog.mariobadescu.com/superbowl-sunday-skin-care/","Text":["Whether you’re a football fanatic or get (begrudgingly) roped into watching athletic things you have zero interest in, we’re proposing a solution that will make both sports fans and non-participants enjoy the Superbowl that much more. You have your jersey. Your seven-layer dip. Your favorite beer. Let’s add a little self-care to the mix and you have your Superbowl Sunday skin care so that no matter the outcome (especially if you’re someone who cares), you’ll be glowing. Defeated, maybe, but glowing. Here’s how to get your game day ritual going: The Ultimate Pregame Between sneaking bites of chips and dip or sips of beer, take your typical pregame to the next level so that you arrive to the bar/living room with your game face on. Literally . Start with Botanical Exfoliating Scrub to get everything looking shiny and new. The key is to gently massage the exfoliant in circular motions for at least 30 seconds to allow those finely ground Ecuadorian Ivory Palm Seeds to polish your skin until it’s soft and smooth. Once you’ve rid your skin of all that unwanted gunk and grime, it’s time to purify. Exfoliating helps loosen up pore-clogging sebum so that your clay-based masks can work more effectively at lifting impurities from your skin. You could just apply your favorite mask , but we suggest multi-masking. Apply Silver Powder on your T-zone to help minimize the look of stubborn blackheads ( here’s a step-by-step guide on how to use Silver Powder ), and apply your go-to radiance-boosting mask everywhere else. (We recommend using Enzyme Revitalizing Mask for that instant-gratification glow.) We know you’re eager to get back to pregame duties, so we’re giving you the green light to cut the waiting time short. Leave on your mask for about 10 minutes, remove it with warm water, and follow with toner and your go-to moisturizer. Stash a few facial sprays in your cooler or fridge (or if you’re going out, take one to go). Trust us on this one. 1 st Quarter Things are going fairly well. Spirits are high: it’s still early in the game, every call is exhilarating, and there are plenty of apps and beer to go around. Spritz your skin with rosewater Facial Spray to keep the glow going. (It’ll look great in selfies.) 2 nd Quarter There are now more chips than there is dip available—and the game is starting to get serious. Are your lips dry from all the shouting (or awkward smiling from pretending you know what’s going on)? Take a sip of water (stay hydrated), apply Cellufirm Drops around your mouth to replenish those dry corners, and smack on some Lip Wax . Continue, as you do. Halftime Screw the commercials. Use this time to de-stress your skin because there’s still a ways to go and you’re too worked up. Liberally mist your complexion with our Lavender Facial Spray , then apply a thin, even layer of Azulene Calming Mask to get your skin feeling zen. But, if watching the Superbowl ads is a long-standing tradition you simply cannot miss, just reach for Facial Spray with Aloe, Chamomile and Lavender . On top of re-balancing skin and soothing your complexion, it’ll have been chilled from being stored in the cooler—offering your skin this cooling, calming mist that’ll help take your mind off of the score. 3 rd Quarter You’re ready and refreshed for the second half of the game. Remember this moment, because it’s not going to last for long. 4 th Quarter Stakes are high. Tension is so thick you could cut it with a knife. Pass around the Lavender Facial Spray, or just mist the general area whenever the room needs a collective cool-down during the last few minutes. And just in case the game rolls into overtime… Overtime Keep Lavender Facial Spray on tap, and if you’re up for it, utilize these crucial few minutes to better your skin and keep yourself occupied. A few ideas: Apply hand cream to prevent flailing your arms about in excitement/despair and inevitably (a) hitting someone square in the face or (b) knocking over a drink or propelling a plate of half-eaten wings onto the carpet. Fight the urge by really working in the hand cream. Give your hands a massage while you’re at it. You’re welcome . Plus, your hands will be ready for all the post-game, good-spirited handshakes. You might be able to fake good sportsmanship, but you can’t fake well cared-for hands. Are you notorious for not having the greatest sportsmanship post-game where, instead of making your rounds of hugs and handshakes, prefer to skulk off and wallow? No worries, no judgment here. Reach for Cuticle Cream —a thick, goopy cream that makes for sticky fingers but very happy cuticles—to occupy nervous hands throughout overtime and give you a real excuse not to participate in the post-game kumbaya. . . .

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Nicole Darmanin"],"url":"http://blog.mariobadescu.com/mbmy5-lindsey/","Text":["The subject of this edition of our #MBMy5 series—our blog series in which we ask MB staffers to whittle down their favorites from the line to just five essentials—is Lindsey! Lindsey sweetened up our team when she came aboard last year with her enviable sense of style, infectious positive attitude, and a major dose of Southern charm. When she isn’t crisscrossing the Southeast making sure that the stores in her territories have everything they need, she is at her home base, Nashville, Tennessee, giving us all manicure envy with paint jobs like this one: Lindsey’s Mario Mani Without further ado, let’s turn this over to Lindsey: Hello, Mario Badescu Beauties! I’m thrilled to share my #MBMy5 today. A little bit about myself: Working with Mario Badescu means that I spend my work days traveling all over the Southeast-throughout Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and my home state of Tennessee. As any professional globetrotter knows, abundant traveling can wreak havoc on your skin. My skin type in one word: troubled. Since I spend so much time flying, the elevation and air conditioning leaves my skin desert-dry. On the other hand, anyone who lives in the south knows that the heat and humidity is unreal! Add in sensitivity to harsh ingredients and major acneic tendencies, and you’ve got the recipe for a skin care conundrum. Today I’m going to chat about my skin care must haves, and how I keep my skin hydrated, clear, and glowing throughout the tumultuous southern weather. Lindsey’s 5 The Enzyme Cleansing Gel is my go-to cleanser. I love the way this melts off my face-makeup, while providing the softest AHA-based exfoliation. It smells like fresh fruit, thanks to the Papaya Extract, and helps to keep my skin clear of mild breakouts. The next, possibly most important, step in my regimen is the Special Cucumber Lotion . It picks up the leftover makeup, oil, and dirt from the surface off the skin, while deep-cleaning my pores at the same time. The Sulfur and Zinc Oxide combination gives my skin an extra acne-fighting treatment, which is crucial for troubled days. Once my skin is squeaky clean, I’ll often start to feel dry. Enter Herbal Hydrating Serum . It’s a water-based gel-serum that provides crucial hydration without leaving my T-zone oily. During my super dry days, I’ll layer this all over my face directly under my moisturizer. On my more oily days, I’ll use this to spot-treat the dry spots. Bonus feature: patting this into the high points of my cheeks gives me the glowing from within look with or without makeup! Finding a moisturizer has always been a challenge of mine. Like I mentioned, my skin is acneic, so I have to be sure that the moisturizer is oil-free, or I could risk causing my breakouts to spread. Being Combination/Oily adds another tricky factor. Add my love of makeup to the mix, and you have what seems like an impossible equation. The Oil Free Moisturizer SPF 30 meets all of these needs, all while providing protection from sun damage (hello, alabaster complexion). I love that the formula is lightweight and dries matte. I can apply my makeup directly after the moisturizer without any fear of slippage. #MBSkinTip: In the colder months, I like to use the Aloe Moisturizer SPF 15 for deeper hydration. A few times a week, I make time to draw a bath and unwind. While my water is filling up, I’ll apply the Whitening Mask . Years of bad skin habits left my skin uneven in tone and texture, and this is my secret weapon to help correct that. After using this mask regularly, I’ve seen a huge difference in post-breakout discoloration—plus, it provides the hydration my skin desperately needs! It’s so lightweight and soft, and only takes 5-10 minutes. Added bonus-it smells like mulberries! Finally, finding a skin care regimen that works for my picky skin has been a game-changer. My makeup sits on my skin beautifully and I feel so much more confident without makeup all together. Thanks so much for taking the time to chat with me about #MBMy5!

If you missed our last installment, check it out here . ‘Tis the season. Where there are chestnuts roasting by an open fire and last minute gift shopping , there’s dry, stressed out skin…which is where our December skincare edit comes into play. The secret to a glowing complexion—yes, even in the dead of winter—is in the products you pick. Nourish and protect your skin from harsh winter weather and intense heating systems, and you’ll look effortlessly dewy at every holiday party. Here’s what’s in our medicine cabinet this December: Orange Cleansing Soap This is a creamy, Orange Peel-infused face wash that delivers mild exfoliation without leaving skin feeling dry or tight. Alpha Grapefruit Cleansing Lotion Let this be your twice-daily, post-cleanse go-to. This revitalizing, alcohol-free toner helps perk up dull skin, soften the look of fine lines, and even out skin tone. Plus, it features Aloe and Linden to deliver soothing hydration so your skin is left feeling rejuvenated. Honey Moisturizer It features—you guessed it!—Honey to deliver radiance-boosting moisture that lasts. Plus, it’s formulated with antioxidant-rich oils to further soften and smooth, leaving skin looking dewy all day long. If it’s particularly cold out or you’re feeling drier than usual… Orange Protective Cream …use this protective day cream instead. Though lightweight in texture, our Orange Protective Cream is specifically designed to help eliminate dryness and banish dullness. Nutrient-rich Beeswax helps safeguard skin from harsh elements (like cold, wind, and indoor heating) as Orange Extract rejuvenates skin to reveal a healthy, radiant complexion. Olive Eye Cream This is our most moisture-intensive formula, perfect for very dry under-eyes or for use as an overnight treatment. It’s ultra-rich and super concentrated—which makes for luxurious application every time. If your skin is on the oily side, you’ll still need to up the ante in the under-eye hydration department; swap out your fall eye cream for the Hyaluronic Eye Cream. Rose Hips Nourishing Oil We love Rosehip—so much so that we keep on in the office, in our medicine cabinet, and in our bag to help smooth dry patches and revive dehydrated skin. Special Hand Cream with Vitamin E Dry, chapped hands are the worst—which is why we decided to repackage our signature hand cream in a travel-friendly tube you can take anywhere on the go. (And at $8 a tube, it makes for the perfect stocking stuffer for everyone!) . . . Need more solutions for seriously dry skin? Check out this #MBRecipe to help revive parched skin !

If you missed our last installment, check it out here . It’s time to get down to business. With the holiday season right around a corner—and trust: it always manages to creep up before you know it—it’s time to take things into our own hands. Rather than let pre-holiday planning and stress get the best of your skin, stock up on these skin care essentials to help keep your complexion looking clear no matter what. Acne Facial Cleanser Perfect for acne-prone or troubled skin, this daily face wash is a must-have for keeping skin clear in time for holiday celebrations. Our cleanser is formulated with Salicylic Acid to exfoliate away pore-clogging surface impurities (which are known to cause breakouts) and Thyme Extract to clarify troubled skin. Special Cucumber Lotion Enhanced cleansing is just what troubled, stressed-out skin needs. This is a powerful astringent that helps remove excess oil, minimize T-zone shine, and dry up existing breakouts to encourage a clearer-looking complexion. Glycolic Foaming Cleanser Radiant, even skin is always the goal—especially when you know there will be camera-happy friends and family snapping away at every family function. We can’t guarantee that your eyes won’t be closed in most of those shots, but we can help you feel confident about going filter-free. For clear, glowing skin, substitute your usual cleanser for the Glycolic Foaming Cleanser one to three times a week (1-2 times a week for dry skin, 2-3 times a week for oily skin). Glycolic Acid not only exfoliates the skin’s surface, but also boasts the ability to deep clean pores too—making it a must-have for refining congested, uneven complexions. Ceramide Herbal Eye Cream Clocking in seven hours of sleep is tough when there’s so much to be done—so to help with tired under-eyes, try incorporating a brightening eye cream into your daily regimen. This one is formulated with Euphrasia (also known as ‘Eyebright’) Extract and Rose Hip Oil (a natural source of Vitamin C) to help restore radiance as Ceramides and Hyaluronic Acid smooth the look of fine lines. Plus, this eye cream boasts a super lightweight, fast-absorbing formula that enables you to apply concealer over top—making it the perfect base if you need a little coverage. Oil Free Moisturizer SPF 30 Just because we’re approaching winter doesn’t mean we don’t need sun protection. Keep up with your daily SPF application, ladies and gents. Buffering Lotion Prone to large, under-the-surface bumps? This is the spot treatment for you. If you’re prone to whiteheads, however… Drying Lotion Your go-to for targeting pesky pimples overnight. . . .

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Subtitle":["mario badescu september skincare monthly edit medicine cabinet"],"Title":["The Monthly Edit: October Skincare Essentials"],"url":"http://blog.mariobadescu.com/october-skincare-essentials/","Text":["Welcome to #MarioMonthlyEdit, where you (yes, you) get a sneak peek at our current essentials. If you missed our last installment, check it out here . Leaves are falling. Halloween stores are setting up shop left and right. If you had any doubt (we’re still experiencing the odd warm-weather day in New York City, so it’s understandable), take a look around: Fall is officially in the air, ladies and gents. Dry air, inevitable chill, and all. Sweaters may be out of storage, but skin is always in—which is why every October is all about maintaining balance as the seasons continue to shift. This is the perfect time to start easing those heavier, creamier moisturizers back into regimen while retiring lightweight formulas. If you’re not sure where to start, take a look at the skincare we’re into this month: Super Rich Olive Body Lotion Autumn air can leave skin tight, ashy, and dry—which is why it’s imperative you moisturize daily. This classic formula is a Badescu best-seller and fall favorite for men and women alike: it’s a rich, nourishing formula infused with Olive Oil to help alleviate dryness for softer, smoother, more radiant-looking skin. Special Hand Cream with Vitamin E If you’re worried about feeling sticky or greasy post-hand cream application, don’t. Our Special Hand Cream with Vitamin E, though creamy in texture, boasts a fast-absorbing formula that sinks in quickly for intense moisture sans the heavy residue. Antioxidant oils nourish dehydrated skin while smoothing the look of fine lines so your hands feel silky-soft, always. Enzyme Revitalizing Mask There’s never a time when we don’t want to glow, but if you need reasons, we got ‘em. Fall weather, personal heaters, and back-to-school stress tend to leave the complexion a little lackluster, which is where masking comes in. For an instant pick-me-up, (and 15-20 minutes of built-in TLC), apply our Enzyme Revitalizing Mask where your skin is looking dull, tired, or dehydrated. Rose Hips Nourishing Oil If there’s one product you need this season, it’s this. Unlike most facial oils, our Rose Hips Nourishing Oil boasts a lightweight yet moisture-intensive formula that helps revive and smooth dehydrated skin. Rosehip Extract, a natural source of essential fatty acids and antioxidant Vitamin C, brightens lackluster skin while hydrating any dry patches—revealing softer, more radiant skin. Seaweed Cleansing Soap It’s creamy, it’s fresh, it’s oil-free—making it the ideal cleanser for all skin types. It never leaves behind a residue, nor does it leave the skin feeling tight or dry. (Enzyme Cleansing Gel fans, you’ll love this face wash as a fall/winter alternative!) Seaweed Cleansing Lotion This is the ideal, in-between-seasons toner. It’s a gentler alternative to an astringent (like our Cucumber Cleansing Lotion), but it still offers enhanced cleansing thanks to its Witch Hazel content. . . . See more of our fall favorites here .

It’s as easy as 1-2-3. Beauty trends come and go—but here at Mario Badescu Skin Care, glowing skin is always in. A regimen is ideal for keeping skin in tip-top condition, but when you’re in a pinch (especially on a Monday morning), here’s how to fake looking refreshed and well-rested . Scrub . Granular exfoliants are particularly satisfying when you want to know you’re giving yourself a good scrub. Our Strawberry Face Scrub , formulated with real strawberry seeds, provides gentle yet effective buffing action to help revive lackluster skin and get rid of dulling buildup. Plus, the act of massaging your skin helps boost circulation and gets blood flowing. (And look! You didn’t even have to run outside a mile to get that healthy, rosy flush!) Nourish . A freshly-scrubbed complexion means that skin is all the more ready to soak up the goods. Take advantage and nourish it with your favorite moisturizer or cream. Antioxidant-rich The Moisture Magnet (SPF 15) is our go-to between seasons when you’re craving intense hydration but in need of a slightly lighter formula. (Try it and you’ll see why makeup artists love prepping their clients’ skin with this moisturizer!) Plus, it offers broad spectrum protection—a must for keeping skin looking radiant and youthful years from now. Glow . You know the drill. Add dewy radiance whenever, wherever with our cult-favorite facial mist .

If you missed our last installment, check it out here . We’re Team #Glow here at Badescu—and there’s no better time than summer to work a glowing complexion. We’ll do anything in the name of radiant skin, so to help achieve a healthy, dewy complexion, these are the July skincare essentials taking up prime real estate in our medicine cabinet: Glycolic Foaming Cleanser . It’s a game-changer for sure. Part cleanser and part exfoliant, this multi-tasking hybrid deep cleans skin of pore-clogging dirt, oil, and makeup while rejuvenating dull skin. Glycolic Acid retexturizes uneven skin and helps brighten areas of discoloration—leaving the complexion clearer, smoother, and more youthful-looking. Special Cucumber Lotion . Sometimes you need a little extra somethin’-somethin’. To help keep excess oil and problem-prone skin in check, give your skin a good sweep with this clarifying toner. Orange Tonic Mask . Weekends should be spent masking while indulging in new summer reads. The Orange Tonic Mask is our treat of choice (and no, not just because it smells like the creamsicles of our youth, spent hailing ice cream trucks from a mile away) because it’s formulated with alpha hydroxy acids to brighten and natural minerals (like Kaolin and Zinc Oxide) to help purify pores. Botanical Exfoliating Scrub . We love how this scrub leaves our face feeling fresh—but we love using it on our body, too. To help keep summer skin soft, smooth, and glowing from head to toe, we make sure we give our skin a good polish two to three times a week. Facial Spray with Aloe, Herbs and Rosewater . It’s self-explanatory why this mist never leaves our beloved medicine cabinet, but this July, we’re storing it in our fridge instead. Nothing beats a cooling, refreshing boost on a hot summer day. Summer Shine Body Lotion . We told you we take glowing skin seriously. Literally, too. This antioxidant-packed body lotion is infused with subtle ribbons of shimmer to add extra shine. Apply to your collarbones, shoulders, and front of your legs added oomph . (You’ll be addicted, trust. There’s a reason why makeup artists douse models in this stuff before sending them out to stomp the runway .) Citrus Body Cleanser . Smells like summer. Feels like summer. Features exfoliating alpha hydroxy acids to rejuvenate your skin, too. . . .

Between holiday parties and New Year’s Eve, sleep hasn’t been your best friend.

It’s nearly summer but I HATE showing my arms! I’m breaking out on my shoulders and I have bumps and pimples up and down the back of my arms. Is this normal? What can I do to make them go away? A. First things first: yes, it’s completely normal to experience breakouts on your arm. Body acne is actually incredibly common (find out why it happens here ) and can affect your neck, chest, back, shoulders, and yes, your arms too. Here’s what we recommend: Cleanse daily using our A.H.A. Botanical Body Soap . The Alpha Hydroxy Acids (AHAs) found naturally in the featured fruit extracts help to dissolve away pore-clogging buildup that contributes to those bumps and breakouts. This formula effectively cleanses and exfoliates the skin all in one. That said, do NOT manually exfoliate ! This means no harsh, granular scrubs because they can tear open pimples, leaving them open, raw, and vulnerable to infection and scarring. Stick to chemical exfoliation, please! Add a toner into your body care regimen. Our Special Cleansing Lotion ‘O’ was formulated specifically with back, chest, and arm acne in mind. Acne-fighting and oil-absorbing ingredients in this extra-strength formulation help to deep clean and promote clearer skin. Simply dampen a cotton pad and wipe affected areas until the cotton comes up clean. Then, spot treat as you would with breakouts on your face. For whiteheads—small, round, pus-filled bumps—use our Drying Lotion to help shrink spots overnight. Use our Buffering Lotion if you’re experiencing larger, red, under-the-skin bumps. To help speed the clearing process, incorporate our Drying Mask into your routine two to three times a week. Try layering a few drops of the Buffering Lotion under the mask to help further enhance anti-acne benefits. Be sure to apply only to areas that are currently erupted or prone to breakouts. You also want to moisturize. To help ensure your skin is balanced (which is key; skin that’s too dry or oily is susceptible to breakouts!), try using an oil-free moisturizer to lightly hydrate without the pore-clogging oils. In the NYC area? Our salon offers a unique back or chest treatment for problem skin that helps to target acne and minimize congestion leading to breakouts on the body. It includes gentle cleansing, steaming, extractions, and other anti-acne treatments to help deep clean acne-erupted or acne-prone skin. . . . Got a question?

No one will ever know. Early mornings are already hard enough as is, but revoking one whole hour of sleep before a Monday ? That’s just cruel. It is what it is, unfortunately. It’s Daylight Savings 2015! Sure, you’ll be forced to come to grips with losing 60 minutes of precious shut-eye, but don’t let that get you down. Daylight Savings may have stolen your hour, but don’t let it take your morning routine too. While everyone at school or the office is lugging around their extra-large coffees with bed sheet imprints on one side of their faces , you’ll be bright-eyed and bushy-tailed. Take that , Daylight Savings. Here’s how: 1. Prep the night before . Fine. Call it cheating, but a head start is game-changing when time is of the essence. Plan your outfit, lunch, etc. before bed and you’ll have cut down your AM routine. The reward is twofold: you and your skin will thank you for the extra hour of sleep and additional prep time for self-care in order to make up for an hour lost. 2. Sleep slightly elevated . Super simple and makes a world of a difference come morning. Not only will it help prevent those pesky sheet imprints (which may lead to premature wrinkling !), but it’ll also help reduce fluid retention – puffiness – around the eyes. 3. Splash your face with cold water . Talk about an instant wake-me-up! The instant hit of cold water encourages blood vessels to constrict, thus reducing any darkness or puffiness (especially around the eye area). 4. Cleanse and brighten at once! An Alpha Hydroxy Acid (AHA) based cleanser (like our best-selling Enzyme Cleansing Gel , a favorite for AM regimens) gives tired skin the rejuvenating boost it needs. AHAs gently exfoliate to remove last night’s oil buildup and general dullness to reveal a brighter, smoother complexion. 5. Stash your eye cream in the fridge. Further eliminate signs of tiredness — the eyes are the window to everything – by keeping your eye cream in the refrigerator. (Don’t know what eye cream suits you best? Check out our guide here ). The cold helps constrict blood vessels and reduce puffiness, which helps with diminishing the look of under-eye darkness and bags. Plus, keeping the eye area properly hydrated helps smooth and lift for a more wide-awake, youthful-looking appearance! 6. While you’re at it, keep your Facial Spray in there, too. Spritz post-moisturizing, after makeup, and throughout the day – essentially whenever you’re in need of a rehydrating boost. Plus, it helps set makeup with a radiant finish so you look your best even with beauty sleep cut short. 7. Hydration is the secret. Plump, dewy skin is often the sign of a good night’s rest. Don’t let Daylight Savings thwart your goal: take things into your hands by moisturizing well for a healthy, radiant complexion. 8. Keep it simple, silly. Wearing makeup? Pare things down the minimum: less is more, and multi-tasking products are a godsend. Choose a lightweight foundation or mix your favorite formula with your moisturizer for easy application. (Blending takes time, and when it’s a Monday and Daylight Savings, #aintnobodygottimeforthat.) Matte looks tend to exacerbate any lines or visible signs of tiredness, so go for natural or radiant finishes. Enhance the natural glow: highlight your cheekbones, brow bone, and center of the lid with a light, shimmery powder to brighten your face and open up the eyes. Eyes looking a bit red? Line the waterline with a nude or white pencil to really fake looking awake. And if you really want to fake looking polished? Swipe on a bright lip .

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Subtitle":["After Sun Cooling Gel summer must-have"],"Title":["First Day of Summer Checklist"],"url":"http://blog.mariobadescu.com/first-day-of-summer-checklist/","Text":["Summer is here! It is the first day, of the best season, of the year! The first thing we reach for after a long summer day Ok, I realize I’m showing very strong bias here, but I’ve taken the liberty of compiling this summer checklist so you don’t miss out on a single second of fun—or, if you don’t love summer as much as I do, so you can muddle through until—shudder—“sweater weather” comes back around. 1. Stock up on Oil Free Moisturizer SPF 30 . If you only manage to check one thing off of this list, please let it be this. Don’t get caught off guard during your next run, or the kids’ next baseball game, unprotected. Your skin has an incredible memory, and that sunburn you get today, will show up as sun spots sooner than you can imagine. Ok, that’s enough gloom and doom for one post, now for fun. 2. Buy a beautiful pitcher and tumblers or if you already have a set, unearth them from your cupboard and keep them handy. I am a major believer in the power of enjoying simple pleasures. I love big glasses of lemon mint water poured from a heavy glass pitcher. It turns something that we normally do on autopilot, like drinking a glass of water, into an experience that we can enjoy and partake in mindfully. Be adventurous and conjure up as many variations of flavored water , iced tea, and lemonade as you can until you have a signature that friends look forward to enjoying when they come to visit. 3. Stock your fridge . . . with your favorite beauty products. While we don’t suggest deep freezing your entire skin care regimen, there are two musts that I always pop in the refrigerator when the temperatures rise. Chill a jar of your Ceramide Eye Gel and apply in the AM to combat the puffiness that can be brought on after a boozy barbecue or a late night bonfire. And nothing feels better after a steamy end-of-day commute than a cool misting of Facial Spray with Aloe, Herbs and Rosewater . 4. Prepare a beach bag. Stop. Where is your beach bag right now? Do you know? Is it empty? If your best friend calls and tells you to drop everything because she is coming to pick you up for a beach day in 10 minutes, could you step up to the plate? Perfect beach days are precious, people. We must always be ready. Have a bag filled with your sunscreen of choice, an effortless sun hat, two beach towels, wet wipes (I know I’m not the only one who likes to indulge in the occasional boardwalk ice pop), and a good book. It’s not too late. Do this today. It is officially summer. I can’t promise that tomorrow won’t be the best beach day of the year, now go. 5. After Sun Cooling Gel , because everyone makes mistakes. Ok, summertime can lend itself to overindulgence. It happens, even to me, and I make my livelihood helping people have their best possible skin. Once in a while, even when you feel like you’ve been vigilant, you might come home, look in the mirror, and eek, you see red. Maybe it is red forearms, or shoulders, maybe you thought you put sunscreen on both legs but were distracted and put it on your left leg twice! Whatever it was, it’s ok, you’re human. And besides you soooo got this, because you had a summer checklist and totally have a fresh bottle of this soothing, cooling, Aloe-infused skin saver waiting for you. 6. Have picnic blanket. Will picnic. If your husband, wife, boyfriend, cute fireman that you smile at on your way to work (hi!), suggests a lazy summer day that doesn’t include sand, are you ready? I always have an attractive picnic blanket, with a cute pattern ready to go. Because not everyone is into sand, or lives near a beach, besides tree shade is really nice when it’s warm out.

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Kimberly Yang"],"url":"http://blog.mariobadescu.com/first-wrinkle/","Text":["Fine lines tend to make their first appearance anywhere from your early 20s to mid-30s. Typically found around the forehead, mouth, or outer corners of the eyes, these debut signs of aging always seem to come when you least expect it. Was it during that routine inspection in your magnified mirror? (A habit we don’t condone, to be clear – but if it’s just one of your SSBs , who are we to tell you to stop?) We’ll abstain from judgment so long as you refrain from squeezing …) Was it during a quick touch-up in your rear view mirror (when parked, of course)? Or was it when you glanced at your reflection in the window on the way to work – and did a double-take when you realized that no, it wasn’t the (usual) imprint of crinkled bed sheets from a rushed morning, but instead, the faintest beginning of a wrinkle. The truth is, when and where you start to see wrinkling is actually largely predetermined by genetics. Curious as to how you’ll age? Take a look at your parents and grandparents: the likelihood of wrinkle onset, depth, and overall appearance is greatly influenced by familial lines. Literally. [QUIZ: How well will your skin age? ] That said, you can prevent premature wrinkling. You can also minimize the appearance of wrinkles – where they develop, their depth and length, etc. – with the right care. You may have found your first wrinkle, but there’s a way to keep visible aging at bay: 1. Apply SPF protection daily, without fail . Make a broad spectrum moisturizer and body sunscreen an indubitable must in your daily routine. Aging free radicals are the number one cause behind sun damage that leads to premature fine lines, sagging, dark spots, and the development of even more wrinkles. 2. Take extra precautions when you’re driving . We all know the importance of sunscreen application and, if spending longer periods of time outdoors, reapplication. What most people overlook is just how much sun damage is done while driving. UVA rays can still easily penetrate windows (tinted or not) of vehicles – so if you’re a daily commuter or spending more than a few minutes in the car (driving or not), you’d better be sure that you’ve got SPF protection. Be sure to focus on the face, neck, décolletage, and hands. 3. Sleep on your back. Favoring one side can actually cause those seemingly innocuous sheet imprints to turn into permanent lines and wrinkles. We spend at least one third of our life sleeping – which means we spend at least one third of our life etching those lines into our face. The best thing you can do? Sleep on your back. Other ways to help reduce this kind of extrinsic wrinkling include swapping out your usual pillow case for a silk one (which is less likely to pull at or leave marks on skin) and varying your sleeping position. 4. Wearing proper eye gear. …which means getting your eyes checked regularly and investing in a pair of polarized sunglasses. Repetitive squinting can actually exacerbate any existing lines – or promote the formation of new ones – around the eyes, between the brows, and on the forehead. 5. Drink more water . Hydrating from the inside out is crucial to overall skin health and appearance. Dehydrated skin cells give the skin a sallow, sometimes ashy appearance, thus exaggerating the look of any visible signs of aging. When cells are properly hydrated, however, skin appears (and feels!) softer and more supple. 6. Make moisturizing a priority. You want to hydrate from both the inside out and the outside in. Look for moisturizers and night creams to help deliver essential hydration and lock moisture into the skin. Humectants and/or emollients can actually help smooth fine lines and wrinkles by plumping the skin for a more youthful appearance. 7. Incorporate anti-aging products into your regimen. If you haven’t started already – start now. Serums and creams formulated with any of these powerhouse anti-aging ingredients can help slow signs of aging by defending your skin any environmental and free radical damage while reducing the look of all visible signs of aging.

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Subtitle":["products to help get rid of blackheads"],"Title":["How to Get Rid of Blackheads"],"url":"http://blog.mariobadescu.com/how-to-get-rid-of-blackheads-2/","Text":["Are blackheads the bane of your existence? You’re not alone. A fast and furious stream of questions on this topic flows into MB headquarters every single day. No blackheads here! Blackheads are not only frustrating because of the visible black dots they sprinkle on your face, but maddening because once they pop up, they kind of just hang out . . . indefinitely. Those prone to blackheads encounter more of a problem if their current skin care regimen provides a hospitable environment for blackheads to live. Unlike other kinds of acne, blackheads don’t flare up then fizzle out and disappear, nope, blackheads reside. They will live on your face until you shake up your routine in a way that makes your skin uninhabitable. The bad news? There is no magic cure for blackheads. The good news? I’m going to give you a plan of attack that will send these unwanted guests packing. Firstly, it is important to know what a blackhead is so that you can understand how to get rid of them. A blackhead occurs when a pore becomes filled with sebaceous material—the natural oily substance produced by your skin—and oxidizes. This is the same process that causes sliced apples and avocados to turn brown after being exposed to air for a period of time. This is also why blackheads are so darn visible. To improve the appearance of blackheads we must make sure to not allow that sebaceous material to sit in the pore for too long. The best way to do this is to add a few simple elements to your skin care regimen that will help to do the following: absorb oils from the pore, dissolve, and/or polish away pore-clogging material from the skin’s surface so that it doesn’t have a chance to darken. For a winning blackhead-fighting skin routine, try adding one item from each of the categories below to your regimen: Absorb Silver Powder – This uber-absorbent powder has earned a cult following of loyalists who love it for its ability to attack blackhead-prone areas like the nose, cheeks, and chin. Special Mask for Oily Skin -This mask is specially formulated to help prevent clogged pores (which lead to you-know-whats. . .) on skin types that are prone to excess oil production. Tonic Masks – This entire line of masks is formulated with absorbent Kaolin Clay to help keep skin clear. Dissolve Glycolic Foaming Cleanser – Use this exfoliating cleanser 3 times a week to break down excess oil and dulling dead skin cells. Alpha Grapefruit Cleansing Lotion – Give your skin a swipe of this classic brightening toner twice daily to keep pores in check and gently brighten with Grapefruit and Lemon Extracts. Anti-Acne Serum – The Salicylic Acid in this non-drying serum works to penetrate and cleanse pores. Apply a thin layer over problem areas before bed and fight blackheads while you sleep! Polish Botanical Exfoliating Scrub – Finely ground Ecuadorian Ivory Palm Seeds perfectly polish pores—use regularly so that oxidation doesn’t have a chance to occur and blackheads don’t stand a chance!

To-do lists at home and at work become longer and social calendars become busier. To turn the pressure up just a little bit higher, this is not one of those occasions when you can hunker down and power through all that needs to be done because the holidays involve showing face. That’s right, nestled between working late to tie up loose ends before the New Year, and taking advantage of your favorite retailer’s extended hours for late gift shopping sessions there are holiday parties. To get through this marathon of a season in one piece I’ve learned to take a few precautions to preserve my skin, sanity, and (most importantly) my holiday cheer—at the end of the day the holidays are supposed to be fun, right? Sleep. Eat. Hydrate. Life simply works better when the basics are attended to. Do whatever it takes, schedule in sleep, set phone reminders to finish your water bottle before lunch, and keep apples and almonds in your bag so that you’ve consumed more than that grande skim latte (extra shot of espresso, please!) before 3pm. Skin. Craft a skin strategy that will keep your skin glowing from today straight through New Year’s Day! Here’s what I’m using this year to keep my skin bright, hydrated, and ready for holiday party pics or any instagrammable moment that comes my way: Holiday Party Season Essentials Botanical Exfoliating Scrub – The energizing mix of botanicals in this scrub makes me feel like I’m being extra kind to my tired skin. Use three times a week to keep winter skin flake-free and smooth. Enzyme Revitalizing Mask – During the holidays I go for an extra shot of espresso and an extra dose of brightening. I’ve been known to gift this mask to new parents, frequent flyers, and college students during finals. Its ability to unearth a glow from even the most tired, dull skin is unmatched. Herbal Hydrating Serum – This is my trusty year round skin-saving hero! The thought of not having a fresh bottle of this tiny miracle worker at hand during the season where my schedule fluctuates between chaos and frenzy is unfathomable. It is my favorite thing for helping to ward off cold weather dehydration without causing breakouts. Eye Makeup Remover Gel (non-oily) – The late nights and early mornings of the holiday season make it very tempting to skip important steps like removing eye makeup. I leave a bottle of eye makeup remover out in plain sight, right next to my toothbrush, to avoid any temptation to crash without removing every trace of mascara first. I’ll thank me in the morning.

(Other than regular tanning, of course.) Cystic Acne is different from whiteheads and other types of ‘surface’ acne because it forms deep in the skin. While Cystic Acne is caused by the same factors—excess oil, blocked pores, etc.—it represents deep pockets of infection. Attempting to draw the infection to the surface by squeezing at acne cysts can prove disastrous. Cystic Acne is the type of acne most likely to cause scarring, as the body forms hardened tissue to help stop the spread of bacteria. Popping or squeezing can exacerbate this tendency to scar, leaving behind a lifelong reminder of the cystic outbreak. [Read: What makes people want to poke and pop their pimples? ] Here’s what to do instead: Rather than trying to pop cystic acne, start using a regular anti-acne skin care regimen to help prevent breakouts from occurring in the first place. Use acne spots treatments specifically created for acne cysts at the first sign of a breakout. We recommend the Buffering Lotion . Avoid using skin care products and cosmetics that may clog pores, such as oil-based foundations or cream cleansers. [ Check out this insider tip for reducing Cystic Acne ] If the above steps do not help to reduce outbreaks, it’s time to visit a Dermatologist to find the perfect solution for your Cystic Acne.

Well that’s what happened with this @mariobadescu Botanical Exfoliating Scrub , it’s the newest from #MarioBadescu and it marvelous. So this scrubs is made to help you get a smoother and more raidiant skin. The first time I used it, I could notice a difference in my skin. It was baby soft and smooth, my skin was glowing and even had a sheen to it, not oily looking but just clean. I have a bit of sensitive skin so I don’t do scrubs too often but this one was gentle. It has nothing but natural ingredients like Ivory Palm seeds, coconut, ginger, green tea and gingko extracts. It’s a gel based formula with tiny granular ivory palm seeds finely ground. It has a light fresh scent and you only need about a pea size to cover your face. I used a little too much the 1st time, and used the extra on my hands so it wouldn’t go to waste. After rinsing off my face and hands were so smooth and soft! I could notice my pores looking a bit smaller too and believe it or not even a few wrinkles looked a bit diminished. All I can say is since I started using a few of the Mario Badescu products they have worked great and I love them! I mean, what more can we say?

Allow me to explain: Have you ever caught a glimpse of your pores in the mirror and just HAD to squeeze them? Maybe you see a blackhead, or maybe it’s just your pores and the oil that naturally accumulated in them. Oily skin, after all, is characterized by larger pores. Combination skin, too. Some of us just can’t help ourselves, and it’s really easy to become a little addicted to squeezing blackheads (or sometimes what you think are blackheads). Unfortunately, this can often damage the integrity of the pore, causing it to stretch and become even more obvious. There are definitely times when blackhead extraction is necessary—and it’s never ambiguous whether or not you need it done. The rest of the time, leave your skin alone or trust it to a trained aesthetician . If you want to help prevent blackheads and unclog congested pores, check out our Silver Powder , which uses a special clay to absorb oil in the skin and help unblock the pores. If you’re interested, you just apply it like a mask in the areas where you experience the most congestion (like your nose or chin), and then rinse off after 20 minutes. You might want to use a toner to remove it as well.

So when our beloved regular—who to the rest of the planet is NYLON Magazine’s Style Director and an all-around NYC style star—told us she was getting married, we knew that the happy couple had lots of planning to do. Oh, and we’re not talking about Dani and her sweetheart. No. The couple that needed to start making lists and marking the calendar was Dani and her long-time aesthetician, Irina. After months of regular facials and even a (gasp!) skin dilemma just weeks before the wedding, Dani pore-lessly said “I do.” Here’s how: On sticking to a schedule Dani: Consistency is key! If you want results, the only way to achieve your goals is to keep at it. The appearance of my skin is of utmost importance to me, especially around the wedding. There were absolutely no deviations from the schedule. I treated my facials like doctor appointments. Irina: Staying on schedule is important. That way, the skin will be the very best it can be for the wedding. The pre-wedding facial plan Dani: I came once a week for 4 weeks leading up to the wedding, and the final week I came in twice. This was a big amp up from my usual every 4-6 week regimen, but it really got me the look I wanted which was virtually flawless, glowy skin! I did not want to be a bride who had a whole face of makeup that was very different from my usual lo-fi makeup look. The facials and skin care regimen made that happen! Irina Dani was already coming in for regular facials with glycolic treatment, gold treatment, and oxygen treatments. Pre-wedding, we increased the frequency of her facials. Then we did weekly oxygen treatments for the three weeks leading up to the wedding. On last minute breakouts Dani I usually have pretty even skin, but two months before the big day I had a GIANT break out due to travel (I mean giant ). It was a nightmare! We had to do a lot of extra work to get it back on track. It was a lot of work, but Irina worked her magic and made it happen! Irina This never happens. Dani never breaks out. She traveled and then broke out. We added some anti-acne treatments into her facial and focused on using spot treatments at home.

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Subtitle":["MBTravels Travel Skincare Diary Puerto Rico Clear Skin"],"Title":["Travel Skincare Diary: From Pre-Flight to Puerto Rico"],"url":"http://blog.mariobadescu.com/travel-skincare-diary-pre-flight-puerto-rico/","Text":["I take my pre-flight skincare ritual very, very seriously. Here’s how I keep my skin clear and glowing no matter how early the flight or hot the climate. SATURDAY 8:00 p.m. I have a 6 a.m. flight tomorrow—which means I should be packed, relaxed, and ready to go. But (spoiler alert!) I’m not: which means I’m scrambling, stressing, and so not ready . In a concerted effort to lower cortisol levels and prevent a pesky pimple from popping up right before vacation , I hop in the shower. Cleanse, of course, then exfoliate from head to toe. Marinate my limbs in Super Rich Olive Body Lotion and make a mental note to decant some Summer Shine Body Lotion (I’m going to Puerto Rico, after all). Slap on Enzyme Revitalizing Mask , because, Puerto Rico . And the packing begins. SUNDAY 3:30 a.m. I’m not a morning person. But I’m a responsible adult who’s dutifully committed to her pre-flight skincare routine, so after silencing five alarms, I force myself out of bed and into the bathroom. On travel days, I swap my usual gel cleanser for a creamy one. Cabin air is extremely dehydrating, so the goal is to maintain as much moisture and dew factor as possible. Seaweed Cleansing Soap is the usual go-to. It smells divine—like the beach—and though that plus would’ve been a defining factor in my youth as a measure of a ‘good’ product, I’m now a hair wiser. I give my skin a generous misting of Facial Spray , apply a few drops of Vitamin C Serum , then layer Seaweed Night Cream on top. Stick with me here: yes, it’s morning, but I’m off-roading here for the sake of maintaining a glow from boarding to landing. It’s oil-free (which is perfect for the oily-skinned or breakout-prone) but still rich enough to keep me dewy for the next few hours. No makeup for me, just another liberal misting for good measure. I guzzle a liter or so of water before heading out the door. 6:10 a.m. Delayed boarding, what else is new? My brother (did I mention this was a family vacation? Well, it is.) gives me major side-eye as I wipe down both our seats and tray tables… so I make a mental note to keep on the in-flight skincare regimen to a bare minimum. Luckily for him, my untraditional moisturizer method keeps my skin happy and I’m too enthralled by Beauty and the Beast to check on my skin. 8:30 a.m. The furniture and cutlery are fighting the townspeople now! (Still on Beauty and the Beast ). I’ve asked for water at least four times since the snack carts started rolling, so the flight attendant just hands me a whole water bottle. Good skincare is half the battle when it comes to keeping skin in tip-top shape when traveling. The other? Staying hydrated. 1:30 p.m. Hellooo, San Juan! Though you’re a grey for my liking, I love you and your palm trees. What I don’t love, though, is having to wait for my room because I all I want need to do post-flight is shower and wash my face. So while my skincare sits in my suitcase, which is held hostage at concierge, my mom, dad, brother, and I wander the streets of Puerto Rico in search of food. Which is easy—restaurants line the streets of the Condado Plaza. 5:10 p.m. We have our room keys— allelujah! I practically wrangle my carry-on out of the bellhop’s hands and sprint to the elevator. I’ve been marinating in sweat and sweats (my airplane outfit of choice) for past few hours and all I want is to swap it all for a sarong and sandals. 5:30 p.m. You know when you just know when your skin is about to break out? (I blame the crazy blast of heat and humidity coupled with annoyance at having to wait ‘til now for our rooms.) Reach for Drying Mask and don’t look back. I even get my brother to mask with me. So, as we sit, mask, and refresh before dinner, I unpack and line up my Mario minis along the bathroom counter. Facial Spray goes into the fridge, of course. MONDAY 7:30 a.m. Not a pimple in sight on me or the brother—and we went in on the mofongo and tostones at dinner last night. Moral of the story? Always travel with Drying Mask , just in case.

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Jill"],"url":"http://blog.mariobadescu.com/cystic-acne-4/","Text":["Cystic Acne is notorious for causing scarring. In fact, we strongly suggest you avoid picking at or attempting to pop cystic acne outbreaks for this very reason. You should also be careful about how you exfoliate. Generally speaking, you don’t want to use an exfoliating scrub (normally an excellent tool for refining the skin) when you have an active acne breakout of any type. However, you should definitely exfoliate; this step is crucial in helping to prevent acne. But how? Use a chemical exfoliant to dissolve the sticky bonds between dead skin cells. Glycolic Acid, for example, is a natural alpha-hydroxy acid made from sugar cane. Here at Mario Badescu, we’re obsessed with the Glycolic Foaming Cleanser (a cleanser + exfoliant in one). In addition to Glycolic Acid, it also offers Chamomile (to soothe) as well as Yarrow, St. John’s Wort, and Sage (to nourish the skin) Acne-prone and love a good granule scrub?

What does this mean? Basically it means that Estheticians are not qualified to make diagnoses for medical conditions such as Rosacea or Psoriasis. Estheticians are also not able to prescribe medications. However, Estheticians can (and regularly do ) make a major difference in their’s clients’ skin. By performing facials, recommending customized skin care regimens, and ensuring that you’re doing everything in your power to reveal your skin at it’s most beautiful, Estheticians play an important role in the appearance of skin. Estheticians can even make an impact on their client’s health in some cases. For example, your Esthetician will be sure to double-check that you’re wearing some sort of sun protection every day. Having an esthetician take charge of your waxing and other forms of hair removal is a wise idea as well- improper hair removal from certain areas can be dangerous. Both a dermatologist and an esthetician are skin care specialists who sport fancy white lab coats, but what exactly is the difference between the two? Continue reading to get a quick snapshot of what specifically distinguishes a dermatologist from an esthetician. Dermatologist · Is a medical doctor · Can diagnose and treat skin conditions and disorders including skin cancer · Can prescribe oral or topical medications · Can perform surgeries on skin abnormalities Visit a Dermatologist when you’re due for a full-body scan (to check for skin cancer and other abnormalities). You’ll also want to see a dermatologist if you have (or suspect you have) a skin disease such as Eczema. In some cases, severe acne can only be treated properly by a dermatologist.

With skin cancer rates on the rise, it’s important to stay educated and aware of the latest information regarding skin safety. While it’s important to keep your skin protected during the day with sunscreen, it’s equally important to observe your skin regularly and keep an eye out for any changes that should be mentioned at your next visit to the dermatologist.* According to SkinCancer.Org , a head-to-toe skin check should be done monthly to watch for any changes to moles on the skin. Skin cancer is the most common cancer, affecting more than two million Americans each year. Fortunately, it’s also the easiest to treat with early detection. The most important thing is to learn how to check for skin cancer. Refer to the following guide and see what you should look out for while performing an at-home skin evaluation. While performing a self-evaluation is a great way to supplement your annual dermatology visit, it’s important to go for regular check-ups with a licensed dermatologist. This illustration shows how to spot check the skin step-by-step. Now, for the ABCDE s of spot checking the skin: A : Asymmetry – If you were to draw a line through the center of one of your moles and both sides don’t match or appear as mirror images, this is worth noting. B: Borders – Uneven, scalloped, or notched edges should be paid attention to. C: Colors – Having multiple colors, including brown, tan, black, red, blue, or any color, on a single mole is a warning sign. D: Diameter – Typically those that are larger in diameter than the eraser on the tip of a pencil should be checked. E: Evolving – Any changes in size, shape, color, or elevation should be discussed with a licensed dermatologist. Keep an eye out for moles that stand out for having an uncommon appearance when compared to your other moles. There are three main types of skin cancer: melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and basal cell carcinoma. Each has a different appearance, so it’s important to use the ABCDE s to stay aware of any changes. Additional safe-sun habits: Remember to wear sunscreen daily, year-round. Nearly 100% of non-melanoma skin cancers are attributed to exposure to UV rays from sun exposure and tanning booths. The sun’s rays can penetrate glass and reflect from sand, snow, and other surfaces, leaving your skin prone to even more exposure. Avoid the sun during the peak hours of 10 AM and 4 PM. Arm yourself with knowledge and safe sun habits, and you can feel comfort in knowing you’re doing the best you can to maintain your skin’s health. *This article is not intended to diagnose skin cancer or offer any medical advice.

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Subtitle":["PFM_preshave"],"Title":["8 Tips & Tricks For Preventing Shaving Irritation"],"url":"http://blog.mariobadescu.com/shaving-irritation/","Text":["1. Be careful, always . Common sense, yes , but some things just have to be said when it comes to wielding sharp products in not-so-ideal (i.e., very slippery) conditions. Shave as if you were using a straight razor- even when you’re not- because carelessness and haste are typically the culprits behind unnecessary shaving irritation . 2. Check your razor blades . Shaving with a dull blade actually increases chances of cutting and irritating the skin. Using a disposable razor? Switch every two to three uses to ensure a pristine and sanitary blade. With all razors – disposable, electric, straight, etc. – you must clean well after each use. Make sure that the blades are completely dry before storing in a cool, dry place. (So no, keeping your razor in the shower is not a good idea!) 3. Never dry shave . Don’t even think about it. It’s the quickest route to razor burn, bumps, cuts, and ingrown hairs. Only shave after the area is damp and softened (for body hair, shave in the shower; for facial hair, shave after skin is softened by pressing a hot towel to the face for 30 to 50 seconds). 4. Always prep your skin . It’s the extra step that makes all the difference in the world. Never skip using shaving cream . (Bonus points if you add a pre-shave conditioner to your regimen; it’ll further soften the skin and hairs for an even smoother, more perfect shave. 5. Shave in the direction of hair growth . Shave with long, even strokes, applying minimal pressure so the blade glides over the skin (and reduces risk of cuts or skin irritations). Be sure to rinse the blade in between strokes. Remember: multiple passes allow for a close shave, whereas shaving against the grain increases risk of irritation. 6. Check the label . Look for shaving products packed with anti-inflammatory benefits. Ingredients like Aloe Vera, Chamomile Extract, and Lavender Extract offer cooling and soothing relief. 7. Re-hydrate post-shave . Shaving tends to dry skin out, making moisturizer essential to the grooming process. Restore hydration with a lightweight yet nourishing balm or cream to help the skin retain natural moisture levels. 8. Reduce and help heal irritations . Skin still a little raw or sensitive? Apply an antibiotic ointment cream on affected areas to help heal the skin, prevent infection, and reduce any redness and inflammation.

Enzyme Cleansing Gel No regimen begins without a solid cleanser—and in this case, we’re reaching for a classic favorite. Exfoliating enzymes and alpha hydroxy acids (found in fruit extracts) give skin a deep clean that leaves the complexion looking bright and refreshed. Aloe Vera Toner Winter skin tends to veer on the dry and sensitive side, so be sure to choose a toner that can help re-balance your complexion post-cleanse. This one is super gentle: any remaining impurities are swept away from the surface as Aloe provides a light, soothing hydration. Cellufirm Drops + Ceramide Herbal Eye Cream Between holiday parties and New Year’s Eve, sleep hasn’t been your best friend. Brighten, plump, and smooth tired under-eyes with this pro-favorite combo: Gently pat a drop or two of Cellufirm Drops around the eye area, then follow with the Ceramide Herbal Eye Cream. Hydro Moisturizer with Vitamin C Replenishing your skin’s natural moisture is essential when it comes to putting your best face forward. This lightweight formula delivers Vitamin C-enhanced hydration to help restore radiance and clarity to dull, dehydrated skin. Need a little more moisture? Apply 3-4 drops of Cellufirm Drops underneath for extra skin-smoothing benefits. Bee Pollen Night Cream Glowing skin is always #goals no matter the season (or new year), so we’re adding this rejuvenating night cream into our evening regimen. This silky-smooth cream is enriched with Bee Pollen Extract and Beeswax to nourish dry skin with antioxidants and essential nutrient—revealing dewy, youthful-looking skin come morning.

It actually boasts potent acne-fighting abilities given its antibacterial effect on Propionibacterium , the bacterium known to cause breakouts. Thyme also possesses anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties (it contains Vitamin C) that make this herbal extract especially ideal for acne-erupted skin. Bee Pollen Bee Pollen is an antioxidant-packed superfood . When used as a skin ingredient, Bee Pollen’s high Nucleic Acid and Vitamins A, B, C, D, and E content provides anti-aging and antibiotic benefits. Antioxidants help fight against free radicals as antibiotic effects help prevent breakouts and reduce inflammation and scarring associated with acne. You’ll find Bee pollen in our multi-tasking, anti-aging, skin-firming Cellufirm Drops . Honey It’s easy to see why Honey is one of the oldest remedies in health and beauty history. As a natural cleanser and powerful humectant , Honey boasts antimicrobial, antioxidant, healing, moisturizing, and skin-softening properties that make it incredibly effective in anti-aging, acne prevention, and anti-acne skincare. All skin types are left with a radiant glow with regular use. Honey clarifies skin by absorbing impurities and decongesting pores of acne-causing buildup. Natural antiseptic properties enable it to help soothe inflammation while encouraging existing breakouts to heal faster. The best part? Honey does all this without over-drying the skin; instead, it imparts just enough moisture to keep skin looking – and feeling – healthy.

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Kimberly Yang"],"url":"http://blog.mariobadescu.com/exfoliating-2/","Text":["A. It depends. You should always consult your dermatologist to determine the best method for exfoliating. Your level of sensitivity – plus the presence of any skin conditions like Eczema, Rosacea, or Psoriasis – dictates if and how you should be exfoliating. As a general rule, however, exfoliation should be avoided during flare-ups and held off until skin has reached a normal, balanced state. For slightly reactive skin, our aestheticians typically recommend our Almond & Honey Face Scrub . It’s a gentle, non-abrasive exfoliant formulated with finely ground almonds and cornmeal, two natural buffing ingredients that help remove any dulling or pore-clogging buildup from the skin’s surface. We’re also thrilled to mention that our brand-new Botanical Exfoliating Scrub is formulated with Aloe, Coconut, and other soothing ingredients. Start by splashing your face with lukewarm to warm water. Lightly massage the facial scrub in circular motions without applying pressure to the skin . Be sure to rinse well and follow with your recommended toner and moisturizer. Related posts: Video Spotlight: Almond & Honey Face Scrub A scrub that takes its cue from nature? We love it!

WHAT’S INSIDE : Beeswax, Honey Extract, Pollen Extract, and Vegetable Oil. WHY IT WORKS : This creamy, lush formula featuring Bee Pollen and Honey Extract boasts hydrating properties that leave skin soft, smooth, and supple. Natural oils combined with an antioxidant Vitamin A blend nourish the skin while fighting aging free radicals, thus helping improve the skin’s texture overnight. HOW TO USE : For nightly use. After cleansing and toning, gently massage the cream all over the face, making sure to avoid the eye area. Don’t forget about the delicate neck and chest – these are two areas that are immediate giveaways of age (or neglect in skincare treatment!), so be sure to moisturize in those places as well. Beauty Tip: Layer up!

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Subtitle":["aesthetician"],"Title":["7 Tips From An Aesthetician"],"url":"http://blog.mariobadescu.com/aesthetician/","Text":["Avoid quick fixes. French ladies are known for thinking of beauty as a daily thing; they don’t wait for problems to crop up and then fix them with expensive procedures. Instead, they focus on daily maintenance and prevention. However, you should use fast-acting ACNE solutions. The more you speed the healing of acne breakouts, the less likely you are to experience acne marks and scars. The Drying Lotion should be your best friend. Use a regular skin care routine. Going willy-nilly with products and not having a set routine can lead to disaster. Maybe you’re exfoliating too often, and now your skin looks too red. Or possibly you’re using too many products with the same (powerful) active ingredient. Put together a routine (with the help of an aesthetician or other beauty expert) and stick to it. Bonus: When you have a regular skin care routine, it’s easy to make tweaks here and there and really see what makes a difference in your skin. Stop tugging at the skin around your eyes. We know it can be hard to remove makeup sometimes, especially waterproof versions. Never try to wash makeup off with your usual facial cleanser. Makeup remover exists for a reason! Mainly because the eyes have the thinnest, driest skin around them, and it’s usually the first to show signs of aging. Make a solemn vow never to pick, pop, or scratch at your skin— ever again . Doing so tends to make acne worse in the long run and might causing scarring. Take the sun—and its dangers—seriously. I wish I could wear a full-size Little House On The Prairie -style bonnet to protect my skin from the sun at all times. The sun causes rapidly accelerated aging and could potentially lead to more serious skin conditions (like cancer). Load up on broad spectrum sun protection and put on a hat. Clean your dirty makeup brushes . Do this, like, all the time , especially if you ever have acne breakouts.

This strange query has come up so many times that we finally decided to answer it with this basic ‘how to use cleanser’ guide. Here we go: SOMETIMES your face should be dry, and sometimes it should be wet. Tissue-off cleansers (which are mainly used for very dry, sensitive skin) should be applied to a dry face. No water necessary. Simply tissue it off for skin that’s clean, soft, and hydrated. MOST of the time, you’ll apply your cleanser to a wet face. Make sure to massage your face in gentle circular motions, making smaller circles with the pads of your fingers around your nose and mouth. Rinse off completely.

Ginseng helps energize the skin while working to diminish wrinkles. It is also said to aid in supporting the skin’s elasticity by boosting sterol and protein production.

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Jill"],"url":"http://blog.mariobadescu.com/dark-skin-above-lip/","Text":["The upper lip area—for a lot of women—is a touchy area. It’s meant to be hair-free, smooth, and even in color. Unfortunately, TONS of women experience darkened skin above their lips, and for a lot of them it’s really embarrassing. This skin darkening (hyperpigmentation) is the result of exposure to the sun mixed with fluctuating hormones. It is sometimes exacerbated by birth control pills or pregnancy. I’ll be honest—I use a higher SPF in this area than on the rest of my face. In fact, I use the Oil Free Moisturizer SPF 17 on my face, and the Oil Free 30 very specifically on the area that tends to darken. Mainly, though, I managed to fade my hyperpigmentation with Vitamin C Serum . In fact, it was much worse in my 20s than it is now (I’m 35) because I’ve been using the serum for a few years now. I don’t even use concealer for this problem anymore. If you’re experiencing dark skin above the lip, it’s definitely worth taking a closer at this serum, if you haven’t already.

In all seriousness, air conditioning is pretty crucial for comfort in the summer. The downside? It really dries out my skin. Here’s what I’m doing about that, in case the same thing is happening to you: Seaweed Night Cream . This much-loved, oil-free night cream is my savior in the winter when indoor heat and low temps dry out my skin. But in the summer?

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Jill"],"url":"http://blog.mariobadescu.com/self-esteem/","Text":["My best friend in high school had perfect skin . Not only was her complexion clear and poreless no matter what, she also had naturally dark, thick lashes and full, red lips. She needed not a stitch of makeup for our entire high school (and later college) career. I, on the other hand, had acne from the time I was 11 until… well now. In high school, this was bad for my self esteem . Of course, today I know how to fight it and keep my skin clear and glowing, but this wasn’t always the case! Don’t let acne keep you from living the fullest life possible! I tried to make my friend recognize how emotionally painful it was for me to struggle with acne, but she never understood. She’d shrug it off and say ‘it’s not that big of a deal,’ which always made it seem like my feelings weren’t valid—that I didn’t have a real problem and I was being ridiculous. That is, until she had a serious case of adult acne sometime in our late 20s. Her acne was severe, far worse than anything I had (or have) ever experienced. It would be difficult to convey her emotional distress—she spent hours crying and researching every possible solution. She withdrew from social activities and became very depressed. She also let me know how very wrong she had been to dismiss my feelings. It became clear to her that acne really can not only negatively affect self-esteem; it can affect emotional well being in a very real way. [Read: Acne and PMS ] Depression is a well-known side effect of acne. Acne can influence nearly every part of your life, from school/work performance to social activities and relationships. For some, acne informs nearly every decision they make.* Here are a few strategies that have worked for me when dealing with acne and self-esteem issues. I hope they are helpful for you as well! Put together a skin care regimen that’s right for your skin. Keep in mind that there is no one-size-fits-all program for acne management . You’ll need the specific cleanser , toner , moisturizer , exfoliant , and acne treatment products that will work for you. This might require that you speak with a skin care expert and that you do a bit of trial-and-error testing before discovering what works for you. Don’t stop living your life. Don’t stop trying new things, going to social events, and working hard to achieve your goals. Remember that nobody cares about your skin as much as you do; most people are too focused on themselves to think that much about your complexion. Embrace imperfection. Keep in mind that the actresses/models/celebrities you see with ‘perfect skin’ are (a) airbrushed and (b) usually wearing tons of makeup. Both men and women wear stage makeup, giving them that flawless glow. Many of them have the same skin issues you do—including acne. Take excellent care of yourself. Eat nutritious food, get enough sleep, drink the recommended amount of water, and examine your environment to see how healthy it is for your mental and physical well-being. Don’t do this to clear up your acne, but rather because you deserve to be healthy. (Although, a healthy lifestyle is very helpful for clearer skin!)

I just break out on my forehead! A. We get this question really often. Many people tend to break out over and over again on the same part of their face. Why, exactly, this happens is largely determined by genetics, lifestyle factors, and environment. Use the Drying Mask only where your skin breaks out. You don’t really need to use an overall acne treatment regimen if you only have forehead acne (or chin acne, or jawline acne, etc.). We rarely recommend a specific ‘acne system’ as it is, since everybody’s skin is so different. Here’s what you should do: Find out which products are right for you overall. (Our skin analysis will help you!) Often, the right skin care products will be what your skin needs to start clearing up and healing acne. However, you’ll want to take things a step further by treating the affected area a little differently. For example, apply our Drying Mask to your forehead only (or wherever you break out), using your usual mask everywhere else.

My sister is 35 and has acne and our brother is 37 (and yes, he still has acne). The Bad News There is no cure for acne. It is a chronic condition that affects some people for short bursts of time and others for a lifetime. You might be one of those people who had clear skin through high school and started experiencing cystic acne at the age of 28 OR you might be a 33-year-old woman who’s had acne since she was 11. The Really Good News All three of us—my brother, sister, and I—have clear skin because proper skin care can and does prevent and treat acne. It’s as simple as that. No, I’ll never be free to fall asleep without washing my face (that’s just asking for a breakout). But who wants to do that anyway ? And yes, I do still have small breakouts here and there, usually when I am stressed out or not taking care of my health. With the right treatment products, however, these breakouts heal very quickly. Here’s what you need to do to achieve clear skin Start by finding the right cleanser , toner , exfoliant , and moisturizer for your skin. These are your basics. (And yes, toner is important.) Once you’re set with that, add in a mask for acne and acne treatment products. If you’re getting whiteheads, for example, a spot treatment for whiteheads is essential. Also, make sure you’re eating and sleeping well and moderating your stress levels. Here’s what you should avoid Stay away from online ‘acne cures’ and fads. These run the gamut from extremely dangerous and ineffective (purposely overdosing on certain vitamins, for example) to fraudulent (any product that claims to ‘cure acne’ is a sham). Acne, like anything else, simply requires solid, consistent skin care. So, will you have acne forever? It’s possible! But it’s also possible to keep your skin clear and beautiful with the right skin care. In the words of Mario himself, put your best face forward. Related posts: Why Do I Still Have Acne?

Make this Mother’s Day all the more special by gifting her the perfect, personalized present. FOR THE PRODUCTIVITY QUEEN She’s the mom who tackles to-do lists so efficiently, David Allen could learn a thing or two. Between perfecting the art of Marie Kondo’s KonMari Method and just getting things done, the Productivity Queen runs a tight ship so everything runs smoothly. From the 8 a.m. drop-off to the 10 p.m. “ I-just-remembered-my-science-project-is-tomorrow!” realization, Mom has things down pat, no matter what. Gift her a set of multi-taskers that will take her current regimen to the next level—and make her feel pampered no matter what life throws her way. ENZYME CLEANSING GEL | GLYCOLIC ACID TONER | OIL FREE MOISTURIZER SPF 30 | ENZYME REVITALIZING MASK | FACIAL SRAY WITH ALOE, HERBS AND ROSEWATER FOR THE JET-SETTER She’s worldly, she’s adventurous, and she always returns from her travels abroad with tales and trinkets. Mom made sure that family time was always educational; every other weekend was spent at a museum, and vacations were packed with guided tours. Years later, she still has the travel bug and is always jet-setting somewhere new (and trying to get you to join her). Put together a TSA-friendly kit full of in-flight essentials for her to take on her next trip so she’ll always be glowing no matter where she goes. ENZYME CLEANSING GEL (2 FL OZ.) | HYDRO MOISTURIZER WITH VITAMIN C (2 OZ.) | ROSE HIPS NOURISHING OIL (1 FL OZ) | HERBAL HYDRATING SERUM (1 FL OZ) | DRYING LOTION (PLASTIC) | FACIAL SRAY WITH ALOE, HERBS AND ROSEWATER (2 OZ.) FOR THE SOPHISTICATE Always polished and effortlessly chic, she’s the woman who instilled the importance of investing in pieces that are timeless (and always left you astounded every time she pulled her hair into a chignon in 10 seconds flat). Everything about her oozes sophistication, from her carefully curated library of classics to her sillage—a subtle hint of Super Rich Olive Body Lotion. Gift her a bouquet of fresh flowers and a set of signature Mario Badescu products to fill her medicine cabinet. SUPER RICH OLIVE BODY LOTION | SPECIAL HAND CREAM WITH VITAMIN E | CORRECTIVE COMPLEX EMULSION | SUPER COLLAGEN MASK | AZLUENE BODY SOAP FOR THE SOUL CYCLE DEVOTEE She’s health-conscious and has been spewing the virtues of wellness before it became chic to—and though you used to find her morning green smoothies questionable, you’ve learned to love (and appreciate!) them all those years later. Whether she’s loyal to spin class or prefers a morning vinyasa flow, Mom has always been on the hunt for the perfect beauty products to take her from pre-workout to post-gym errands. Surprise her with a new gym bag that totes all her essentials—includes a few skincare essentials that keep her skin clear and glowing. ENZYME CLEANSING GEL | SEAWEED CLEANSING LOTION | FACIAL SPRAY WITH ALOE, HERBS AND ROSEWATER | HERBAL HYDRATING SERUM | A.H.A. BOTANICAL BODY SOAP | VITAMIN E BODY LOTION FOR THE GLAMOROUS She’s the mom who knows the power of a good lipstick and understands the importance of the at-home mini facial, too. There are home videos of her doubled over in laughter as you ran across the hall, face smeared with red lipstick and shuffling in heels, trying to be just as beautiful as her. To this day, her handbag always has a red lipstick and a bottle of perfume, just in case . Indulge Mom with a collection of luxe serums, scrubs, masks, and lotions she’s bound to love. ROSE HIPS NOURISHING OIL | VITAMIN C SERUM | PEPTIDE RENEWAL SERUM | ALMOND & HONEY FACE SCRUB | ROSE HIPS MASK | APRICOT BODY LOTION FOR THE BEAUTY ADDICT Her medicine cabinet was magical. Still is, to be clear: It’s artfully arranged with the latest and greatest, peppered with tried-and-true Holy Grails she collected along the way. How she managed to multi-mask and let her DIY mani dry between dinner is still a mystery, but she’s shared every other beauty trick in the book with you. Pimple? No problem: dab on some Drying Lotion. (You’re eternally grateful that she helped you and your complexion come out of teenage-dom unscathed.) Looking dull? Mask and exfoliate. Etc. It’s likely she already has the best of Badescu, so instead of presenting her with products she has seen before, gift her a set of brand new and under-the-radar goodies that’s bound to get her excited about skin care again.

It’s also the most likely to cause scarring, so proper treatment is really important. There aren’t too many over-the-counter products available for Cystic Acne. After all, it’s the hardest type of acne to treat. It’s crucial, though, to reduce the amount of Cystic Acne you experience while speeding up the healing process; this is THE best way to help avoid scarring. It’s also just pretty nice to be able to prevent or recover more quickly from Cystic breakouts. If you’re looking to reduce cystic acne, we’re really proud of our Buffering Lotion , a unique product that was designed specifically for Cystic Acne. Most people find it surprisingly thin and watery in texture. This makes it better able to penetrate the skin and do its work. Have you ever tried it?

WHERE : In her little brown bag after a trip to Kit to replenish some of her MB skincare ! WHY : She wrote : “My USA trip [was] still four weeks away and I’ve been having such tremendous results with MB that I didn’t want to wait until my holiday to stock up.” “…I also went out on a limb and purchased the Enzyme Cleansing Gel to replace the rather greasy Sorbolene Cream I’ve been using to wash my face. The lovely Kit SA also threw in a sample of the Kera Moisturizer which she highly recommended for my dry/sensitive skin. There was something about it that made me dubious but I used it last night and again this morning and I’ve been really impressed with it so far. The only drawback is that it doesn’t contain SPF, however it does sit lovely underneath my makeup (and absorbs quickly and without fuss) which is also really important to me.

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Subtitle":["age spots"],"Title":["Fading Age Spots"],"url":"http://blog.mariobadescu.com/age-spots-2/","Text":["Through the years, it’s likely your skin has accumulated some sun damage. You see, age spots are more accurately called sun spots. Sometimes they are even known as liver spots, although they really have nothing to do with your liver’s functioning. These areas of hyperpigmentation are basically caused by a combination of accumulated sun damage and hormonal fluctuations. This is a skin problem that you can be really optimistic about—there are some very real solutions for age spots. If you’re looking to even your skin tone and brighten up areas of discoloration, there are a couple of things you need to know. Vitamin C (ascorbic acid), for one thing, is a powerful skin-brightening agent. Kojic Acid is another. With an every-other-day application of Vitamin C and regular use of Kojic Acid, your skin care routine will produce noticeable changes in tone, reducing and fading unwanted hyperpigmentation.

(Season 2 premieres tonight at 10 PM – get your popcorn ready ladies and gents!) WHERE : Atop her super organized (and incredibly zen!) makeup station on the set of Scandal season two, which she tweeted oh-so-artfully. A fellow makeup artist reintroduced her to our line, and she promptly fell in love all over again. WHAT : Rosewater Facial Spray Aloe Vera Toner Drying Lotion Hydrating Hand Cream Cellufirm Moisturizer Aloe Moisturizer SPF 15 Ceramide Eye Gel Healing Cream And not pictured (but just as well-loved!): Protein Night Cream Olive Eye Cream Pre-Shave Conditioner Electric Shaving Lotion WHY : Because beautiful makeup needs beautiful skin. And beautiful skin needs good skincare. On the Facial Spray : “We start our mornings with a little spritz of aloe & rose. Its nice to start the makeup with a little pick me up especially if its 5am on a monday!! I use the spritz at my station all day to feel refreshed & clean.” On the Healing Cream : “This was a big hit!!. One of our actresses went home with a jar of the healing cream and said that it is one of the most miraculous products she has ever used. Its great for break outs, red patches, sunburns and even cat scratches.” On the Protein Night Cream : “Just a divine silky night cream. The actors love to slather this on after a long day on set.” On the Olive Eye Cream : “I sent one of the actresses home with this beautiful eye cream and she came back the next day and said ” I am in love with my eye cream, I want to slather it all over my body too” (we got her the body lotion version ).” On the Pre-Shave Conditioner & Electric Shaving Lotion : “It’s always nice when we can share the products with the guys. We have a big cast & lots of male regulars. We have a whole shaving station in the makeup & hair trailer. We keep it stocked with pre-shave conditioner and electric shaving lotion. The pre-shave helps us with ingrown hairs and the redness from shaving everyday. The guys love using the products because most men are sensitive (they just don’t admit it) and they don’t always realize there are products made just for them.” . . . Thank you Denise!

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Jill"],"url":"http://blog.mariobadescu.com/new-york-fashion-week-2/","Text":["Mario Badescu Skin Care walked the runway at New York Fashion Week! (Well, on the faces of the models at least.) We caught up with a few amazing makeup artists and designers to find out which MB products were their personal must-haves at the Fall 2014 shows. Emmy-nominated makeup artist Katie Pellegrino was working designer Mark McNairy’s show this season. She told us: “If a model came from another show, I would remove the makeup and prep the skin with the Aloe Vera Toner , a soothing toner to calm their potentially distressed skin. This toner leaves the skin supple and clean without stripping the surface of its natural moisture. I also use the Aloe Vera Toner if the model came in fresh-faced since it removes built-up dirt and oils that the skin naturally acquires or produces from normal activity in a congested urban environment like NYC.” After working the SIKI IM Studio show, makeup artist Benjamin Puckey had this to say: “I loved using the Honey Moisturizer this season because it instantly transforms the model’s dry skin to a supple and smooth base for makeup. The models always comment on the delicious scent.” Designer Laurel DeWitt had a truly beautiful show for her eponymous couture line. Laurel says: “Since I was introduced to Mario Badescu I use the Acne Facial Cleanser every day and live for the Drying Lotion . Mario has definitely lessened breakouts tremendously. I am so happy to work with them for NYFW to introduce and share the products with my audience!” Mario Badescu was also front and center at the Hernan Lander show at Lincoln Center.

There’s nothing like having eyebrows that are shaped exactly the way you want them, is there? That being said, there’s always the stray here and there to be removed between waxings. If you’re tempted to tweeze away these hairs yourself, take a little advice from a professional: Using the fingers of your free hand, be sure to pull the skin around the hair taut . This will make plucking the hair out much less painful and will reduce the chance of post-plucking irritation or bumps. Only remove hairs that won’t affect the shape of your brow. In other words, concentrate on those hairs that are obviously not meant to be there and leave the rest to your waxer. Invest in a new pair of tweezers if you’ve been using the same ones for years and years.

Fortunately, there are steps you can take to minimize the difficulty of shaving when you have acne. Here’s what you can do: Use the right cleanser. Using a daily cleanser with Salicylic Acid will accomplish two goals: (1) it will help clear up and prevent acne breakouts and (2) it will reduce the likelihood of ingrown hairs by encouraging skin cell turnover. Steam it up! Soften the skin and hair using steam—either shave after taking a shower OR soak a washcloth in warm water and place over your face. There’s a reason that old-school barbers do this! Condition the hair. Using a pre-shave conditioner will further soften the hair and help reduce shaving irritation. Shave in the direction of hair growth. It may seem counterproductive, but this is the best way to get a close shave without further aggravating your skin. Don’t make too many passes in the same area, and use gentle motions to prevent rupturing acne breakouts. Avoid shaving during a serious acne breakout. There may be times when you’ll have to make a judgment call. If your skin is particularly broken out and irritated, skipping a shave or two may be necessary. Related posts: 6 Quick Shaving Tips 1.

Potatoes, pot- ahh -toes; tomatoes, to- mah -toes. What we do care about, however, is that it’s nearly spring here in the northern hemisphere. Perhaps not yet officially, but little hints and previews of the warm weather to come have had us longing to put away the winter coats for good. And since spring can’t help but make feel a little giddier inside, we’ve compiled a little checklist of things to keep around to celebrate the unofficial arrival of spring: Bring out the color ! We New Yorkers love black like none other, but a little pop of a color here or there – be it a scarf, a top, an accessory, or something as subtle as new manicure – somehow makes us that much more spring-ready. Add a little bit of zest to your cleanser. We love tailoring our skincare regimen to the weather (that is, unless you’re happy with what you already use!). That little spring in our step – no pun intended – has us wanting us an extra boost of a refresher. The Enzyme Cleansing Gel is one of our most popular for good reason – it freshens and brightens! Refresh and renew . With our Flower and Tonic Mask . It soothes skin while removing dirt and impurities for a smoother, healthier complexion. It’s universal enough for all skin types, and gentle enough for that transition between delicate winter skin and spring skin (after that, we love any other cleansing and tightening mask!). . . .

Let’s see what she was picking up at the show! Are you shopping for yourself or for your kit? I don’t usually shop as I review the show but recently ran out of my Drying Lotion so it was kismet to see the [Mario Badescu] booth at The Makeup Show. Tell us about what you’ve picked up! Drying Lotion , Enzyme Cleansing Gel and the Facial Spray with Aloe, Herbs & Rosewater . The Drying Lotion ($17) is my go-to zit-zapper as its effectiveness on blemishes is unbelievable. I have been using it for years and was just running out of a bottle when I came upon your booth at The Makeup Show. Lucky girl! I also fell for the Facial Spray as it’s affordable ($7-12 depending on size) and it makes my sometimes patchy dry skin feel more moisturized and refreshed after application. It’s oil- free which is great for me and can also be used on the go. I can also use it either before or after makeup, making it utterly convenient. The Enzyme Cleansing Gel ($12-20 depending on size) I knew was your best selling cleanser so I wanted to try it. It’s fab and the ingredients (such as the skin brightening papaya and grapefruit extracts) gently exfoliate the skin. My face appeared less dull after just one use. I also liked the fact that it was gentle enough to be used both in the morning and evening. Thanks for your time, Nicole! Nicole Gordon Levine can be found on Instagram and Twitter .

All that cleansing, facial massage, and steaming can feel really heavenly . After all, aestheticians are trained in massage and special cleansing techniques to make the experience as pleasant and effective as possible. Cleansing correctly can really make a difference. If you’re simply putting the cleanser on your skin and rinsing it off, you’re not really getting enough out of the product: Here’s one aesthetician’s secret for a really good cleanse: Starting at your neck, begin by applying the cleanser in upward strokes, using the pads of your fingers (and being gentle). Move upward to your cheeks, still making upward strokes. Cleanse your chin by making small circles with your fingers, and be sure to cleanse this area thoroughly. Then, run your fingers several times outward along the skin above your mouth. With the pads of your ring finger, massage the sides of your nose in small circles, again cleansing carefully. Finish by cleansing your forehead in upward strokes. Rinse! This type of cleansing works well with our Enzyme Cleansing Gel , which glides on the skin during cleansing and is non-foaming.

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Jill"],"url":"http://blog.mariobadescu.com/clogged-pores-2/","Text":["We don’t like it any more than you do. The answer to this question is pretty simple: your pores get clogged with excess oil and dead skin cells. When a lot of oil and skin cells clog up the pores regularly, they become stretched and appear larger. This is one reason that those of us with oily skin have larger pores, whereas drier-skinned folks sometimes appear poreless. Blackheads occur when a mass of sebum and skin cells hardens and builds up in the pores; they turn dark when this mass is exposed to oxygen and oxidation occurs. You can see why pore strips wouldn’t be very effective at unclogging pores. They operate on the principle that blackheads are solid in nature—like hairs that can be pulled out of the skin. Really what you need is something that will soak up excess oil and keep the skin’s oil production balanced. If you’re interested in treating or preventing blackheads and clogged pores, we use our Silver Powder for just this purpose. It includes Kaolin, a natural clay that soaks up oil, helping to eliminate excess production. You apply it with a wet cotton ball to the areas that most often experience blackheads (like your nose or chin), wait about 10 minutes, and then remove it with your toner (or water; toner works better, though). We don’t really recommend that you use it all over your face– unless, of course, you’re experiencing clogged pores and blackheads all over. See what everyone is saying about it: Janet A. This product is amazing. I have never seen something work so well and so fast! It is very easy to apply and remove. It minimizes pores, the appearance of blackheads and such ups excess oil without over drying. AND its a great price and lasts a long time! Angela C. I, like many other reviewers, have oily skin with large poors and a great deal of congestion on my nose and chin. The Silver Powder is truly amazing. After the first application I couldn’t believe how clear my skn was. It is my absolute favorite of the Mario products. Courtney D. A saleswoman recommended this product to me, and she was practically jumping up and down with excitement tell me how great it was. I went home and used it, and when I wiped the product off my skin looked AMAZING. I generally have a ton of blackheads on my nose but they were all gone, and my skin looks and feels smooth and even, and isn’t oily at all usually within an hour or two of washing my face, my skin gets oily gross. It’s seriously amazing. Erin L. I have large, clogged pores on my nose and T-Zone in general for as long as I can remember. I know, it is as terrible as it sounds. No matter how many facials or products I would use nothing would unclog my pores. In ONE ten minute application of this product there was an UNBELIEVABLE difference. My nose looks clear. Doesn’t dry skin at all. I can’t recommend this product highly enough. IT IS WONDERFUL!!

It’s not to say that one is necessarily better or worse than the other, but simply that one person’s Holy Grail isn’t necessarily going to be right for you. After all, if you’re 16 and have oily skin, you definitely don’t need an anti-aging moisturizer , right? Turns out the reverse is true, too. For a while my mother and I shared the same moisturizer; it served me very well, and it seemed to do okay for her too. But here’s the thing: never settle! You’ve got this one skin to live in, so you better treat it right. Why settle for just okay when there’s something out there that could be incredible? And let’s face it, a moisturizer that’s right for my early-20s skin is probably not the best choice for mature skin. It was the Cellufirm Moisturizer that made her realize that a moisturizer could do much more than just, well, moisturize . Sure, hydration is key, but what certain skin types need (and what all skin deserves, really!) is nourishment . The Cellufirm Moisturizer is exactly what sensitive, maturing skin needs: a rich, anti-inflammatory Seaweed Extract moisturizer formulated with Collagen and Elastin for skin-refining benefits. Over time, it helps smooth the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles for a plumper, more youthful complexion. And isn’t that what skincare should do?

Seriously, guys, it doesn’t get much better than this—Hyaluronic Acid helps absorb moisture from the environment while preventing moisture loss in order to retain skin’s natural hydration levels. Which is probably why we have 5 products with this ingredient in the name, and endless others that include it. Hyaluronic Acid isn’t an exfoliating acid (like Alpha Hydroxy Acids, for example). It’s actually a naturally occurring polysaccharide, and one of the main things that keeps young skin looking plump and supple. The skin makes less and less of it as we age, and bad habits like poor diet and smoking help deplete it even faster. Applying Hyaluronic Acid to the skin creates a temporary plumping effect, leaving the skin softer, smoother, and better hydrated. In other words: younger-looking .

Remember when you were a teenager or 20-something and you could stay out all night and wake up looking fresh and lovely? As most of us have experienced, this is no longer the case in our thirties and beyond— and that’s a good thing : getting enough sleep is also important for your overall health. Not 30 yet? Keep reading, this advice is important for everyone. Let’s talk more about how crucial sleep is for preventing premature aging. We’re always talking about how the skin repairs itself while you sleep. In fact, it’s the reason we suggest you apply serums before bed, to boost the skin’s reparative process. Here’s what happens while you’re catching up on beauty rest: · While you’re sleeping, your body produces human growth hormone, which is essential for collagen production. · Facial muscles that cause wrinkles and lines will relax while you’re in the deepest part of sleep (the final three hours). · During the middle of the night, Melatonin also increases, the ‘sleep’ hormone that also protects the skin against aging free radicals. A lack of sleep also seriously compromises the immune system, which can also affect the skin negatively in terms of allergens, sensitivities, and increased inflammation. Are you getting enough sleep these days?

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Subtitle":["travel beauty"],"Title":["Travel Beauty 101: The 2-Hour Flight Edition"],"url":"http://blog.mariobadescu.com/travel-beauty/","Text":["Depending on when you read this, I’m either settled as comfortable as possible (read: swathed in a pashmina with an eye mask at-the-ready) or just about to head to the airport at an unholy hour for my 6 a.m. flight. What you probably want to know (besides my aversion to being shoved into small spaces that prohibit any and all movement) is what’s in my on-flight toiletries bag – essentially all the beauty bits deemed necessary to carry me through this short flight. Two hours may seem too insignificant to render any need for a serious travel beauty regimen, but let me beg to differ on two points: (1) Recycled cabin air is incredibly drying (and suffocating) to the skin – all skin types, no matter how oily, require a boost in hydration on any flight; (2) Emphasis on the aforementioned unholy hours. Pulling an all-nighter to make this flight means puffy eyes, dark circles, redness, and any other lovely thing that comes with lack of sleep. This two-hour flight is now all I have for a power nap plus intense beauty treatment so I can land looking ready and well-rested for what’s to come. What’s in My Bag? The Cucumber Cleansing Lotion is the first thing I’ll use once I’ve buckled up and settled in. It’s super refreshing and helps keep T-zone shine at bay – and doesn’t require trekking to a restroom. (another thing I’m adverse to: airplane bathrooms, ick ). After I’ve “cleansed,” I start building up layers of hydration to keep my skin nourished despite the less-than-ideal conditions. I begin with a few drops of my favorite Vitamin C Serum to help encourage my skin’s natural luminosity – it’s the secret to leaving the plane looking fresh-faced and dewy! – and layer over it with a generous application of the AHA & Ceramide Moisturizer . It’s yet another product meant to help rejuvenate dull, congested complexions. To finish, I pat a few drops of the Rose Hips Nourishing Oil wherever I’m prone to dryness first – between the brows, tops of the cheeks, and around the nose. To take care of the puffy, tired eyes situation I will most definitely have going on, the Hyaluronic Eye Cream will help replenish moisture and nourish the delicate under-eye area. Lips! Lips are always important! Yes, I’ll be guzzling water so long as I’m awake (but you know – not too much where I’m forced to navigate the aisles to the dreaded BR), but H20 isn’t enough. Your lips are the first to dry out because the skin is thinnest there, so I slather on lip balm like there’s no tomorrow. I’ll pop on my headphones , turn up the music, and slap on the silk eye mask . (Quick tip: to prevent any unsightly kinks in my hair from awkward sleeping positions on plane rides, I twist my hair all down its length and wrap it into a loose chignon on the top of my head. Once you release it, you’ll get pretty, soft waves with nary a hair out of place!) Fifteen minutes to landing, you say? Right… Tone again. Do you hear your skin exhaling with relief? It’s the perfect pick-me-up. I’ll moisturize again before generously spritzing my face and décolletage with the Rosewater Facial Spray to refresh and revive my complexion. It does wonders in creating an instant glow. Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your hair! To further recreate the look of the well-rested, I’ll curl my lashes to help open up the eyes and swipe on a few coats of mascara . Reapply a light layer of lip balm before finishing with a glossy lip pencil or gloss to bring color to my face. Et voila! Fresh-faced and ready for that weekend getaway. . . .

Luckily for you, however, there’s more to come—we’re just hopping off the plane from Vail, Colorado to head out to sunny LA for The Makeup Show. Curious? Follow us on Snapchat at mariobadescu ! For those of you lucky (or un-lucky; perspective is everything) enough to have been spoiled with traveling before the extra baggage charges and 3.4 oz rule, you’ll remember a time when checked luggage and generous carry-ons were a reality. Alas, times are a-changing when we live in a world where Marie Kondo’s The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up (a.k.a. the Minimalist’s Holy How-To Bible) is #life and all your liquids must be decanted into generic bottles and fit into a quart-sized Ziplock. It’s about as un-chic at things get, not to mention, anxiety-inducing for the beauty junkie. How are we to choose between two cleansers we love? What if we need Cream X but only packed Cream Y?! Trust: I understand the crisis at hand. But with a less-is-more philosophy and a little bit of Marie Kondo’s magic along the way, we can do this. If I can, you can too—and believe me, it took years of weekend-getaways or last-minute trips that taught me a trick or two about learning how to pack light even for a two-week trip: Know your TSA rules and regulations . The worst thing that can happen to a beauty junkie is having to tear open a carefully-packed toiletries bag only to have your Holy Grail favorites tossed into some bin. Equally horrible: not having enough room to pack essential clothes and things because your travel beauty bag takes up half your carry-on. Keep to your tried-and-true basics . I like to pare down as much as I can—which means a cleanser, toner, moisturizer, mask, and serum are all I need when it comes to skincare. The less you bring, the happier you’ll be, according to Marie Kondo. Packettes are a jet-setter’s best friend . Seriously. You don’t need to decant your full-sized products, there’s no fear of spillage, and you save serious space with these little guys. If you have to pack everything in your medicine cabinet, packettes are how you’ll get it done TSA-style. Luckily for you, we gift you three of your choice for FREE with every order—which means you can pick your faves and keep them on hand for your next trip. Minis are a must . Deluxe-sized sample are also incredible for travel because you don’t have to deal with the mess that comes with downsizing your full-sized products into jars or bottles that might open-up in your bag. Double-bag everything . It’s better to safe than sorry. Here’s what I always travel with: Enzyme Cleansing Gel : This has been my go-to cleanser since day one. It’s gentle, it’s refreshing, and it’s the perfect pick-me-up as both a morning facial wash and evening pick-me-up after a long day. Botanical Exfoliating Scrub : Since this scrub’s launch a year ago, I’m not sure how I ever lived without it! Recycled cabin air leaves my skin parched and flaky, so a gentle polish post-flight helps keep my skin soft, smooth, and refreshed. Whitening Mask : I’m always looking to hydrate and brighten my complexion whilst travelling, and this has been my go-to. As soon as I get to my hotel and finishing exfoliating, I pop on this mask while making sure my hotel Wi-Fi works J Vitamin C Serum : How darling is this mini Vitamin C Serum (which you can get in The Brightening Kit at Ulta)?! Again—brightening is the name of the game when it comes travel beauty, so this little guy remains by my side no matter where I land. Facial Spray : Ditto with our cult-favorite facial spray. Instant hydration plus a boost of radiance is much-needed while I’m away, and this rosewater mist does the trick. . . . What minis do YOU travel with?

TLC, R&R, ABC, XYZ – which modern-day woman has the time to indulge? Take advantage of those long-haul flights (and car rides!). There’s no better time or place for a spa treatment for you combo/dry to dry types because (1) you’re left with few options mid-air, (2) you can still multitask, you Wonderwoman! And (3) your skin needs it; flying dehydrates and exhausts the skin . You and your skin both need it – and deserve it. Any questioning glances? Forget they exist. You come first. But first things first: decant all your MB favorites ( like Martha Stewart does ) into little travel-sized containers and bottles; remember, TSA-friendly is 3 oz or less ! 1. Cleanse your skin. We love products like our Cleansing Milk with Carnation and Rice Oil . It’s an oil-based, tissue-off cleanser, so it removes all makeup (this is crucial!) without stripping the skin. The best part? No trip to the tiny airplane bathroom; no water is needed. 2. Indulge. Apply a few drops of your favorite serum. The Cellufirm Drops is fantastic as it provides an optimum base of moisture retention and improves the firmness and elasticity of your skin. Our Hyaluronic Emulsion with Vitamin C is similar to the Cellufirm drops, acting also as a barrier against dryness and heat. Another lovely option is the Vitamin C Serum – a powerful antioxidant formula that tones and improves texture whilst brightening your complexion. Take you pick – what do you need? 3. Nourish. With our Ginkgo Mask , a creamy, gel mask that doesn’t harden on the skin. It’s the ultimate mask for frequent travelers – it soothes and nourishes dehydrated, parched skin with a blend of oils. Leave it on for at least 20 minutes before removing it with the Cleansing Milk. 4. Tone. For a truly thorough cleanse and instant refresher. 5. Moisturize. Protect against dehydration; feed your skin. You want that soft and supple skin post-flight? Indulge with a cream. Combo/oily skin types will love our Orange Protective Cream or Ginseng Moist Cream , and anyone dryer will adore the Hydro-Emollient Cream (a.k.a. “the in-flight cream” at the MB offices!). They’re absolutely lush – your skin will drink it all in. Don’t forget to re-apply lip balm consistently! And eye cream is a must – apply under the eyes and around the outer corner up to the brow bone (target those crow’s feet!). 6. Love your hands. We’re hard on them – give them a break. Massage our Special Hand Cream with Vitamin E or our Hydrating Hand Cream to keep hands soft all flight long. Repeat any of the steps as needed. But in between each step, slip a lavender-filled eye mask over your eyes and sleep . Or, plug in that laptop and get work done. Whatever makes you happy. . . .

Scroll down to check out the 4 skin care rules that could be hurting your skin. 1. Exfoliate three times each week. Those of you with skin that isn’t sensitive are welcome to exfoliate up to three times a week. However, if your complexion is sensitive, red, and/or dry, exfoliating 1-2 times is your best bet. Too much exfoliation can damage the skin’s protective layer, leaving the skin vulnerable to additional irritation and sensitivity. More of a good thing isn’t necessarily better! (Read: What happens if you never exfoliate? ) 2. Drink 8 glasses of water a day for beautiful skin. While drinking lots of water will help you achieve radiant, glowing skin, there’s no hard-and-fast amount to consume each day. This should be determined by your weight and activity levels. For example, a man who weighs 180 pounds and is very physically active requires more hydration than a 110 pound, sedentary woman.* 3. Exfoliate using a scrub. Some of you should! After all, we love our Almond & Honey Non-Abrasive Face Scrub . Not to mention the Kiwi and Strawberry face scrubs… However, those with active acne breakouts and/or super-sensitive skin should steer clear of scrubs and opt instead for a chemical exfoliant, such as Glycolic Acid or Lactic Acid. (We recommend: Glycolic Foaming Cleanser ) 4. Benzoyl Peroxide is the only way to get rid of acne. Benzoyl Peroxide (BP) has long been the standard treatment for acne, but it’s not the only (and often not the best) option. Instead, check out products containing Salicylic Acid, Sulfur, and Thyme.

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Subtitle":["skin tone"],"Title":["Skin Tone And Skin Care: The Connection"],"url":"http://blog.mariobadescu.com/skin-tone/","Text":["Do darker skin tones need special skin care? Many of our clients are surprised to hear that no, skin tone is not the first (or second, or even third) thing we think of when determining which products will be the best for your skin. Considering that a) most skin care products are formulated to be color blind and b) the color of one’s skin does not determine skin type, focusing on products that will be helpful for the current condition of each individual’s skin will garner the best results. One’s skin type (oily, dry, combination) is the primary factor in determining which skin care products to use. The second most important consideration when picking out products would be your skin’s specific conditions (such as acne or sensitivity), and here’s where skin tone may come into play: certain skin tones are more susceptible to certain conditions. Scroll down to discover which conditions are more likely to affect your skin. Consider skin type and condition when choosing skin care products. Fair/Light Complexions are more prone to developing skin conditions/issues such as Rosacea and Sunburn while Medium/Dark Complexions are vulnerable to hyperpigmentation (dark spots) caused by acne scarring, sun damage, or picking at blemishes. This is because darker complexions have more melanin (cells that produce the skin’s pigment) than fairer skin tones. All Skin Tones can get acne, sun damage, psoriasis, eczema, and overall sensitivity. Sun damage is caused by a lack of protection against solar rays and overexposure to the sun (the sun does not discriminate—its rays shine down on every inch of the globe). (Read: A guide to choosing the right cleanser ) Regardless of how fair or dark you are, it is important to follow a proper skin care regimen according to your skin type and any conditions that may exist such as acne, Rosacea, signs of aging, Eczema, etc. If you’re unsure of your skin type and don’t know which products to use, take our online analysis here . At the very least , all ethnicities should practice a basic skin care regimen that includes cleansing, exfoliating, toning, and moisturizing ( with built-in sunscreen for daytime ). Are you choosing the right products for your skin type/conditions?

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Jill"],"url":"https://blog.mariobadescu.com/travel/","Text":["I went on an extended trip to Madrid a few years ago and discovered that you really can have pretty skin no matter what. When it comes to any type of travel, it’s just a matter of advance planning and preparation. Before we start talking about dry cabin air or unfamiliar climates, let’s ‘clear’ up one thing—there are very few of us who should travel without Drying Lotion . Unless you haven’t seen an acne breakout in, like, over a decade— or you’re one of the few people who have never had a pimple in your life—you can rest assured that travel will mess with your skin. Slipping the Drying Lotion into your luggage is basically a big ol’ pound of cure in exchange for a mere ounce of prevention. Now, let’s talk about air travel. Airplane cabins are notoriously dry—after all, the air you’re breathing during flight is taken from the surrounding atmosphere (in low-humidity high altitudes). For example, the air up 35,000 feet is usually at around 10% humidity, and there is no additional moisture pumped in to make it more comfortable or easy on the skin. Come prepared by moisturizing , either with a heavier moisturizer than usual or with a bit more of your usual product. If you’re flying during the day, it’s especially important to use a moisturizer that contains sun protection. You can get a sunburn on an airplane, too. Protect your lips and also make sure the eye area is moisturized with your favorite eye cream . You know that gross, kinda crusty feeling you get during and after a really long flight? We have a solution for that! First, go brush your teeth. Then, spray your face with a refreshing facial spray. Ours is the Facial Spray with Aloe, Herbs and Rosewater . It’s hydrating, it smells lovely and (if you’re wearing makeup) it can be used to set makeup, too. Plus, it gives you the feeling of being new and clean. (Remember, you will need our sample size or a special travel size of any skin care products you bring on board an airplane. Check out Martha Stewart’s advice on packing toiletries .) What about the trip itself? If you’re changing climates you need to bring skin care products that are meant for your skin type and the climate of your locale. For example, if your skin is oily and you’re visiting the Dry Valley in Antarctica (where it hasn’t rained for nearly two million years) or the Atacama Desert in Chili (commonly known as the driest place in the world), it’s entirely possible that you don’t need all of your oil-absorbing cleansers and masks and moisturizers. Or you may need to use your usual mask less frequently or exfoliate more often. Your best bet is to speak with a skin care specialist about the little tweaks you can make in your regimen before you go anywhere. You can always call us at 800.223.3728. Also, don’t let jet lag destroy your skin. When I was in Spain, I followed the Madrilenos example and began going to dinner after ten p.m.… and was completely exhausted for the first few days. I purposely cut back on caffeine and alcohol consumption and committed myself to adjusting to the time change. Finally, be sure to keep your face protected from the sun and other elements. If you’re anything like me, you spend a lot more time outdoors on vacation than you do in your real life. Keep your face protected and it will thank you for years to come, And wherever you’re going, take some Mario with you! Not sure where to go?

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Subtitle":["body care"],"Title":["Skin Sins: Neglecting Body Care"],"url":"http://blog.mariobadescu.com/body-care/","Text":["What’s your attitude about body care ? As you’ll see, it’s about a lot more than just using lotion and calling it a day- there’s a side to body care that’s really about self-care and making time for you . Read my story: I distinctly remember one visit to the doctor’s office as a child, sitting on a crinkled, waxed sheet, cold hands twisting my arm to better see just how ashy my elbows were. My mother was concerned about the bumps on the back of my arms. (I’d later discover – much, much later – that the offending bumps were some mild form of keratosis pilaris.) “Do you moisturize?” I stared at my pediatrician blankly. I was maybe seven at the time; what did I know about moisturizing ? I had greater things to worry about – writing book reports, making sure I didn’t catch cooties from boys at recess, devising excuses to skip piano lessons. Moisturizing was neither a priority nor was it a word covered in grade school vocabulary. “Do you use lotion?” I’m seven , my sassy second-grade self was tempted to say. Only I wasn’t brought up to be sarcastic toward my elders (plus, my mother was in the room), so I just shrugged my shoulders and looked at my mom. That was my first run-in with the importance of body care; my pediatrician scolded me, rambling about the importance of using lotions and things, only I was (once again) seven and couldn’t care less. [Read: More about Keratosis Pilaris, aka ‘Chicken Skin’ ] Clearly the lesson was not learned, because nearly a decade later ( oy) I was tying my shoelaces on the sidelines, prepping for the football game’s halftime show when I realized with horror how scaly my legs looked in my dance team uniform. (Skirts and shell tops don’t do much for hiding ashy elbows and knees, for the record.) I vowed that once off the field and back home, I’d do as the beauty experts advised: exfoliate, dry brush, and scrub myself to baby-soft – albeit a little pink – perfection. Then slather with lotion as if there were no tomorrow. [Read: Body Acne, 4 Steps to Clearer Skin ] I was a little (okay, a lot ) gung-ho then, and while I’ve learned to ease on the dry brushing bit, I haven’t gone a day without a proper scrub-down followed by generous moisturizing since. Scaly skin and ashy elbows and knees belong to bygone days of naiveté. In the process, I learned to truly love my skin, to love taking care of it, and I learned to love my body. It’s taking care of me, and thus demonstrating that deserve to be treated with utmost respect. Exfoliating with lush scrubs and Alpha-Hydroxy-Acid-packed cleansers (which helped the bumps on my arms!) didn’t make my skin beautiful – it helped me see that it was beautiful as it was. Indulging in all sorts of body lotions did wonders as well, but it was feeling pampered and glow-y that made me feel confident about baring all no matter where I was or what I wore.

Since you are what you eat and we’re all about a well-rounded, healthy lifestyle, these are a few of our favorite (healthy!) foods for healthy skin*: Almonds . A handful a day keeps the wrinkles at bay! Almonds are packed with Vitamin E, an antioxidant that helps to protect against free radicals while preventing premature aging. Avocado . A rich source of Vitamins C and E, lutein and good-for-you fats that provide anti-inflammatory and anti-aging benefits. It’s a go-to for a boost in the glow department. Blueberries . More than a few of our MB estheticians don’t start their mornings without a serving (or two!). Blueberries are said to be the greatest food source for antioxidants – they offer anti-aging prevention that’s too good not to try. Carrots . Made famous by a certain beloved cartoon bunny and renowned by the generations of mothers telling their children that carrots are good for the eyes. But know this: carrots are great for your complexion. Incorporating carrots into your diet is said to not only help clear breakouts, but also help stimulate collagen synthesis – all thanks to the high Vitamin A and C content in carrots. Green Tea . So it’s not a food, per se, but it’s the antioxidant powerhouse of all drinks (second to water). It’s also a diuretic, meaning it can help flush out toxins for a clearer, healthier complexion over time. Oranges . Yet another antioxidant-rich food. A high Vitamin C content means a helpful boost in neutralizing free radicals and helping collagen production. Salmon . Our diets are often lacking in omega-3 fats (but overcompensating in omega-6 fats). This imbalance leads to inflammation that later blocks pores and triggers overproduction of oil. Because salmon is rich in omega-3 fatty acids, this fish is said to be one of the best foods for helping prevent breakouts. Spinach . It’s not called a superfood – or a favorite of Popeye – without reason. Loaded with minerals and antioxidants, this leafy green is high in the Vitamin C needed for collagen and elastin production. Walnuts . For a dewy, hydrated glow, walnuts are your go-to because of their high Alpha-Linolenic Acid content. They’re also a great source of omega-3 fatty acids. . . . *Consult with your doctor before making any dietary changes. (image via ) Related posts: DO CERTAIN FOODS REALLY IMPROVE YOUR SKIN?

More commonly known as Keratosis Pilaris, this is a treatable and (very) common skin condition. What is Keratosis Pilaris? Do you or have you ever had dry, rough patches of tiny red or white bumps on your arms, thighs, cheeks, or other parts of your body that would not go away? There’s a chance you may have (or might have had) Keratosis Pilaris (K.P.). This skin condition is not serious or harmful, but can be a nuisance. Generally it does not hurt (nor is it itchy) and oftentimes it subsides by the age of 30. Who Does K.P. affect? Keratosis Pilaris does not discriminate based on age, gender, or ethnicity and therefore can affect anyone.I Think I Have Keratosis Pilaris. What Now? Although there is no cure for K.P., it can be managed by using gentle, skin-softening skin care products in combination with exfoliating products, particularly both mechanical (i.e., face scrubs) and chemical exfoliants (i.e. alpha hydroxy acids and salicylic acid). It is always best to consult with a dermatologist to advise you on the best option for your case of K.P. Think you might have Keratosis Pilaris?

Your skin produces up to three gallons of sweat per day . Three! That’s a whole lot of breeding ground for bacteria that can lead to unwanted acne breakouts. Make sure you wash and tone your face twice daily to keep your complexion clean. 2. Your skin begins aging by your early 20s . That’s why Mario Badescu himself always told his clients the importance of investing in a good eye cream once you hit the big 2-1. You know what they say: it’s never too early for prevention. 3. Massaging your face regularly helps stimulate the elasticity in your skin . Massages are no longer reserved for spa days or special occasions; make them a part of your daily skincare routine. 4. Sleeping on your side (or face down) can cause premature wrinkling . You spend nearly 2,500 hours per year between the sheets, most of which is spent in the same sleeping position. Try sleeping on your back instead: that’s 2,500 hours of damage you can help reverse to some degree. 5. Skin renews itself every 28 days or so … but keep in mind that there are about eight pounds of dead cells your skin needs to get rid of per year. There’s no doubt your skin needs the boost; eight pounds is a whole lot of heavy lifting. And that, my friends, is where regular exfoliating comes into play. . . .

Koalas are similar to humans because they share a particularly human quality— opposable thumb s. They’re also adorable. True or False: If you can move your finger, it isn’t broken. (*See answer below.) The practice of hand kissing started during the 17th and 18th centuries in Central and Eastern Europe. Usually, the hand was proffered by a woman to a man who was of similar or higher social status. Refusing the offered hand was considered extremely impolite. All hands are unique. As law enforcement knows all too well, your fingerprint is unlike any other. Your palm, too, is special in that it is one of the very few areas of the body that is hairless and it contains a pattern that only exists on one person—you. Many a palm-reader has benefited from knowing this! Cold hands, warm heart? There are a number of reasons your hands might be cold—and none of them are related to the temperature of your heart. Washing your hands frequently is the very best day-to-day ritual to avoid the spread of nasty bugs like bacteria and viruses.

When I began my schooling, I was still in the grips of a tanning-bed obsession . I was bronze—in the middle of January, no less. During one of our very first classes, our instructor had us crowd into a pitch-black closet and check out each other’s skin using a blacklight, which shows sun damage long before it is visible on the surface of the skin. Have you been living under the assumption that, if you had sun damage, you would be able to see it? So was I. And yet, there I was with the naked truth written all over my face; I had inflicted a huge amount of damage on my skin—most of which I wouldn’t see for several more years. Mine was even worse than some of the women in the class who were significantly older than I was at the time. It’s easy to put things out of our minds when they are not literally cropping up on our faces. The summer is coming to an end and we know that you’ve been listening to our pleas for more vigilance in the sun. It’s difficult, though, to be perfect all the time. We know that sun-related skin discoloration happens. We’re not expecting you to wear a face-kini, after all! Our Whitening Mask is great for brightening up uneven skin tones.

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Lee Ann"],"url":"https://blog.mariobadescu.com/pores/","Text":["Large pores tend to be more prevalent among those with oily skin; when oil glands produce more rapidly, it can cause the pores to expand. You can’t shrink pores, but you can reduce the appearance of them. Here’s how: Exfoliation A combination of both mechanical and chemical exfoliants should be used in your skin care regimen—not simultaneously, but on alternate days. A face scrub, for example, is a mechanical exfoliant. Chemical exfoliants use chemicals such as alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) to chemically dissolve or loosen and lift away dead skin cells. When it comes to helping reduce the appearance of pores, Glycolic Acid is your new best friend. Glycolic Acid is an alpha hydroxy acid and has the smallest molecular structure out of all the AHAs. Glycolic Acid deep cleans the pores and helps retexturize the skin, making the pores look less visible. Try our Glycolic Foaming Cleanser and Almond & Honey Face Scrub . Toners Toners are great for helping to deep clean the pores. Try our Seaweed Cleansing Lotion . It contains witch hazel to cleanse pores that are clogged with dead skin cells. Masks Face masks can help tighten pores and reduce the appearance of them. Try our Temporary Lifting Mask . It contains pore-minimizing ingredients (such as Egg Protein) to help tighten and refine the skin. Or try our Silver Powder . It addresses blackhead congestion by cleaning out debris from the pores, revealing smoother, less congested skin. You can also use the Silver Powder as a mask by applying it all over the face.

If not, put down the pore strip and check out how to really get rid of blackheads: this is an oil-absorbant powder designed to unclog your congested pores. It treats blackheads and clears up excess oil. Many people (myself included) experienced serious results after only one application. Let’s see what you had to say about the Silver Powder From Malissa F. in Pennsylvani a: This is the best product I have ever used hands down! It does exactly what it claims….. the very first time you use it! It makes pores almost disapear and blackheads are comepletely gone! I did a double take in my mirror! I even looked in the 8x magnifying mirror and was astounded. I absolutely love this product and even though I have dry/combo skin it was not irritated or dried out. I sent some to my sister who has very oily skin and she loves it too! Buy this… you will be so happy you did! Tara T. in Colorado agrees: I am new to Mario Badescu, i learned about the drying lotion in Allure Mag. I ordered the products and seen the silver powder i used for the first time and OMG it pulled out all yuck from my chin area in “ONE” treatment… i never have had acne problems ever but now that i turned 30 its been coming more but i am so happy with these products and Highly recommend them to everyone… I have tried every product out there and this will be my on hand cannot be without products…. thank you so much. And Massachusetts’ Courtney D. says: A saleswoman recommended this product to me, and she was practically jumping up and down with excitement telling me how great it was. I went home and used it, and when I wiped the product off my skin looked AMAZING. I generally have a ton of blackheads on my nose but they were all gone, and my skin looks and feels smooth and even, and isn’t oily at all usually within an hour or two of washing my face, my skin gets oily gross.

So much so that I twice broke up with a guy because he objected to my nightly face-washing routine .

In fact, it’s entirely possible that I’m totally weird .

I can’t imagine what she’s thinking as she steps off the train with nary a toothbrush or set of pajamas, and yet it’s a habit she’ll never break. Worse than this, though—she commits two of my biggest skin care pet peeves. First, because she hasn’t packed anything, she’s forced to use my skin care products. Which totally wouldn’t be a big deal except: a) They aren’t right for her skin type, and b) She uses so much product that I run out of it very quickly. She abuses her mooching rights! Seriously, what is she doing with all of that product? She also tends to flood the bathroom to Noah’s Ark-proportions every time she washes her face.

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Jill"],"url":"https://blog.mariobadescu.com/aha/","Text":["Exfoliation —the process of removing dead cells from the surface of the skin—is one of the most important things you can do for your appearance. As we get older, we begin to renew our skin cells at an increasingly slower rate, which can lead to a dull appearance, clogged pores and, yes, even acne . Worse, moisturizer and treatment products are unable to penetrate skin that isn’t properly exfoliated. Scrubs are a great way to exfoliate. However, this option isn’t right for everyone. If you have particularly sensitive skin, acne, and/or dry, delicate, aging skin, consider instead using a chemical exfoliant. This brings us to the big question: What are Alpha-Hydroxy Acids ( AHAs)? I use this term all the time, and it occurred to me recently that a lot of people have no idea what I’m talking about when I mention AHAs. Alpha-Hydroxy Acids gently remove dead skin cells on the surface of the skin by dissolving them. This encourages cellular turnover. Generally speaking, AHAs are useful for fading sunspots and age-related discoloration; firming the skin; avoiding acne; and reducing wrinkles and fine lines. Even better, your other skin care products— moisturizer s , serums , etc.—will be far more effective on skin that has been properly exfoliated. Glycolic Acid is a very popular AHA because of its smaller molecular structure. Derived from sugar cane, it is able to penetrate the skin and break up the sticky bonds between dead skin cells so that you can be rid of those pesky, dulling creatures for good—or at least until the next time you exfoliate. Lactic Acid is similarly useful. Cleopatra bathed in sour milk for softer, smoother skin, and we know why: it’s helpful in inhibiting the production of melanin (to reduce discoloration) while exfoliating and hydrating the skin. This is important, so let’s take some time to determine which type of exfoliation is right for your skin—a scrub or a chemical exfoliant like an AHA?

Sure, when I went to the beach or a backyard barbeque, I’d slather on some serious sunblock, but on regular work days? Never. These days, I’m taking my skin a lot more seriously. Every morning, I apply an SPF of 17 or 30 to my face, neck, and décolleté (that’s a fancy word for the lower neck/shoulder area). Because I’m driving to work every day, I will even sometimes apply the higher SPF on my left shoulder and neck. For those of you with a long driving commute, remember that the sun’s rays are stronger through glass. (If you don’t believe me, check out this image. ) Another confession: for the past month, there has been a slight variation in the colors of my arms. In other words, people have actually asked me ‘why is your left arm so much darker than your right?’ And here’s the thing: I don’t want any of my skin changing color in the summertime or in any other season for that matter. As lovely as a nice tan can be, it’s the end result of an extremely destructive process. When the sun’s rays penetrate the skin, the body protects itself from DNA damage by producing melanin (pigment). Altered DNA is the culprit behind skin cancer. Not convincing enough? How’s this: Eighty to 85% of aging is caused by the sun. Have you ever noticed that you look a little older during the summer? Wrinkles and discoloration are magnified when you get a real tan. However, there’s no reason to be super-pale if you don’t want to be. Personally, I’ve been having a lot of success with self-tanner this summer. The best part about using self-tanner is that you get to experience the glow and you get to remain young and fresh-looking. What are you doing to protect your skin every day?

Read This!"],"url":"https://blog.mariobadescu.com/prevent-stretch-marks/","Text":["When I was pregnant, many mothers (including my own mother) implored me to slather my body with cocoa butter in order to prevent ‘frightening stretch marks’ as they affectionately called them. So I waddled myself to the drugstore and looked for a cocoa butter cream- particularly one that had ‘prevents and minimizes stretch marks’ emblazoned on the jar or tube. The esthetician side of me had to read the label on the back of the product, and I noticed a mile-long list of ingredients, many of which included chemicals that were not exactly fetus-friendly. I boycotted the cocoa butter and took a chance. Lucky me, I wound up with very few stretch marks – if any at all. Had I known about Mario Badescu Skin Care at the time, however, I’m sure my son would have leaped for joy in the womb with every application of Muscle Oil all over my pregnant body. Whether you’re expecting or trying to become pregnant, you may want to give our Muscle Oil a try. It prevents stretch marks and helps minimize existing ones. Not to sound biased, but unlike other stretch mark-reducing creams and topical ointments on the market that contain baby-unfriendly ingredients, our Muscle Oil is a concoction of all safe and natural ingredients such as Almond oil and Vitamin A, D & E oils. Did you just feel a little kick? It’s a sign: your baby loves the idea of our Muscle Oil, too! No related posts.

If you feel good about yourself, it shows. If you are genuinely happy with who you are, it shows. It’s a relationship based on synergy: your skin reciprocates exactly how you treat it, and vice versa. Beautiful skin starts with good skincare. And that’s just the start. Ingredients:* Kiwi Face Scrub Your favorite eye cream Orange Tonic Mask Cucumber Cleansing Lotion AHA & Ceramide Moisturizer Vitamin C Serum *As always – substitute and experiment with products you know your skin loves! . . . Radiance, here we come! It’s just a step away… Exfoliation is key to a glowing complexion . Start with freshly cleansed skin . Massage the Kiwi Face Scrub gently onto wet skin, letting the Kiwi seeds and soft bits of seaweed buff away dead skin cells. Let it sit on your skin for 2-3 minutes to allow AHAs to breakdown any other dulling buildup, and massage again before thoroughly rinsing. Pat dry. Apply an eye cream before your mask . It’s one of our secrets – as the mask dries, it can pull the delicate eye area and cause dryness; let the eye cream act as a much-needed treatment. Cleanse, tighten, and brighten . Apply a thin layer of the Orange Tonic Mask , a Kaolin clay-based mask that helps purify and tighten pores. Orange extracts gently exfoliate and refine the skin’s texture while Balsam Peru soothes. Let the waiting games, begin ! Read magazine. Start a book. Look up recipes to try. Relax . You earned those 20-30 minutes to spend on you and yourself. Cleanse and tone . Wash the mask off thoroughly and pat dry. In outward wiping motions, use a cotton pad soaked with your favorite toner for a final and thorough cleanse. We love the Cucumber Cleansing Lotion because it calms and refreshes while tightening pores. Dewy skin is skin that’s been well moisturized . The AHA & Ceramide Moisturizer instantly boosts skin’s radiance, leaving skin looking and feeling refreshed. It gently exfoliates overnight, sloughing away dulling buildup to make way for new, healthy skin to the surface. (It’s also the perfect moisturizer for warm weather!) The best, saved for last .

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Sara Kosmyna"],"url":"https://blog.mariobadescu.com/pimple-popping/","Text":["The American Academy of Dermatology reports that by the mid-teen years, over 40% of people will have some form of acne or acne scarring. Chances are, you stumbled on this article by no mistake. Like many teens and adults, you want to know if you are addicted to popping pimples, and we’re here to help you recognize the signs and break this bad, but common, habit once and for all! (Read: 7 ways to sabotage your skin ) Here are four signs that your preoccupation with pimples runs more than skin deep: 1. You see things that aren’t there. Okay, maybe not in the most literal sense. Sure, there might be a slightly clogged pore on your nose, but it isn’t as bad as you think. That little black dot may even be a freckle, but you aren’t entirely convinced. Not until you get a closer look in your 10x magnifying mirror and give it one experimental squeeze, just to be certain. 2. You can’t resist touching acne prone areas to feel for bumps. You know where your breakouts occur. You know these areas so well because your fingers are familiar with grazing over them every few hours, minutes or even seconds to search for tender spots or slightly raised blemishes that could feed your desire. When you don’t find blemishes, you aren’t entirely convinced and feel the need to dig deeper. (Keep in mind that touching your face with dirty hands could cause more acne.) 3. You cause flare-ups to become worse. Sometimes you don’t have to search for acne because it appears on its own. When this happens, your pimple popping obsession goes into overdrive and you attack. Often times, what started out as a small blackhead, whitehead or cyst turns into an eruption that may or may not scar. You might be convinced that what you’re doing will shorten the lifespan of this particular breakout; this is never the case. 4. You feel guilty after popping or trying to pop pimples. Once the deed is done and the temporary satisfaction wanes, you start to regret digging into your face. You know that there are better ways to handle acne, but you just can’t help yourself. You vow to stop popping pimples but, before you can finish the thought, you notice something else cropping up next to the last one. While it may feel temporarily relieving, albeit painful, to pop pimples, the fact is that you’re probably causing more harm than good. Manually extracting, or popping pimples, can lead to increased inflammation, scarring and the spread of bacteria under the skin. This can cause even more blemishes, thus perpetuating the cycle. (Read: The MB acne spot treatment cheat sheet ) Some tips to break the cycle: Treat existing breakouts with acne products. For example, the Drying Lotion was designed to help dry up existing whiteheads while the Drying Cream is excellent at combating those under-the-surface bumps and pimples. Don’t spend unnecessary time in front of the mirror. Find a good quality concealer to cover blemishes. Relieve anxiety in a different, more constructive way. Hold yourself accountable.

It’s time to learn everything you can about this frustrating and common condition, and find the very best solutions to fight acne. Isn’t it time for clearer skin? Let’s get started. Before you reach for the nearest pimple cream or magnifying glass, you should first learn what causes acne and then identify what kind of acne you have. After that, choosing acne treatment products will be a much easier process. Four types of acne commonly affect the face, neck, chest and back. These are: 1. Pimples You say pimple; I say papule… Both refer to a solid raised bump on the skin’s surface. Pimples usually appear due to hormones; however, they can be summoned from improper skin care and a hot and humid climate as well. Both teens and adults can suffer from pimples. One of the best ways to avoid pimples is through prevention and using an acne serum . 2. Whiteheads These pesky pore-hoggers also go by the alias of pustule (what a fitting name!) because they are actually inflamed pimples that contain pus. When pus forms under the top layer of the skin a white or yellow color is visible on the surface. These pimples can be tempting to pop, but don’t do it! More on that below. There are much more gentle and effective ways to treat this type of acne. 3. Blackheads Also referred to as comedones, these appear when trapped oil, dirt and debris are exposed to air and harden in the pores. The clogged pore takes on a darker color from the oxidation process, which is why they’re called blackheads. These are very common in combination and oily skin types, but blackheads can even affect dry skin. Luckily, it’s easy to banish blackheads with a few simple steps. 4. Cysts Commonly called zits, these are closed, abnormally developed sacs that contain fluid, matter, or a mixture of both above or below the skin. Often painful, cysts can range in size from relatively small to much larger. Cystic acne can be uncomfortable, but it can be treated with products like our Buffering Lotion , which forms a protective barrier and targets erupted areas. An important note about picking at or popping acne eruptions: While the thought of manually extracting, or popping, acne may be inviting, it can do much more harm than good. Using the fingers to pop pimples can spread bacteria and prolong the breakout by affecting even more of the face. Picking or trying to squeeze pimples can also cause the skin to rupture, and it can slow down the healing time. Instead, take matters into your own hands the best way by treating existing breakouts, and preventing them before they start with the right products. Say hello to clearer skin!

Even if you’re doing everything right, there are other factors at play. Hormonal changes, for example, can cause unexpected acne outbreaks—and they always seem to come at the least opportune times. First things first: Try to avoid squeezing, picking, and scratching at your face. Why is this such an important piece of advice? Picking or squeezing at acne can permanently scar your face. We’re willing to bet, though, that sometimes—in the midst of a bad breakout—you’re not exactly thinking long-term. You’re might only be thinking: Oh No! I have that party/date/job interview and I can’t have this thing on my face! We get it , but here’s the thing: Remember when we talked about the causes of acne? Well, when you squeeze or pick at your face, instead of purging your skin, you’re actually forcing the bacteria/sebum/dead skin cells even further into the follicle, possibly causing the follicle wall to rupture and spread the infected material deeper in the skin. Essentially, what you’re doing is causing yet another breakout, possibly even acne cysts. Let’s keep our hands away from our faces. After all, what seems like a temporary solution could very well cause on ongoing cycle of breakouts and long-term damage! The only solution when you have a serious outbreak that needs to go away fast is to use a spot treatment. We know from experience, though, that acne spot treatments tend to cause peeling, redness, and some serious dryness. Sometimes you might wonder if they’re even worth a try at all. The important things to look for in an acne spot treatment are ingredients that simultaneously treat while calming irritation, redness, and excessive drying. For example: • Salicylic Acid: This ingredient works by exfoliating dead skin cells and keeping the follicles clear. • Calamine: Calamine contains zinc oxide, an astringent and drying agent that also soothes inflamed and irritated skin. • Colloidal Sulfur: Sulfur works as an anti-inflammatory, bringing much-needed relief while providing antibacterial action (it limits the acids that bacteria require for growth). (Hint: Check out Mario Badescu’s Drying Lotion ; this product includes all three of the above-listed ingredients and has acquired a sort of legendary status among makeup artists, celebrities, and the rest of us. Try it for yourself if you haven’t yet to see what all the hype is about!) Related posts: CONQUERING ACNE, PART TWO: WHAT CAUSES ACNE?

In the spirit of new skin beginnings—and a life with clearer skin—let’s get to the root of what causes acne . (In a quick online search, we found a lot of confusing, misleading, and totally unhelpful explanations and advice; let’s get it right this time!) Acne Vulgaris (isn’t that the worst name?) is caused by disorder within the pilosebaceous units—which are comprised of a hair follicle, the sebaceous gland, and the hair. (Just FYI, you might be more accustomed to referring to the follicles as pores. ) With the exception of your feet and palms, these units are everywhere —with the majority located on the chest, neck, and face. This is why we most often break out in those areas. The sebaceous gland produces sebum, a substance necessary for keeping the hair and skin moisturized. Here’s what’s supposed to happen: when the follicle is full, the sebum should spread onto the skin’s surface, giving your skin and hair a healthy, moisturized appearance. When the follicles become obstructed for whatever reason and/or the skin begins to produce more sebum, the real trouble begins. You know that bacteria are necessary for the survival of all living things, right? Well, there is a totally normal, common bacterium known as Propionibacterium acnes —and it lives on your skin. P.acnes relies on the presence of sebum for survival. When puberty (another awful word, right?) sets in, sebum production increases in response to hormonal changes. More sebum, then, means more P. acnes . Worse, the cells on the upper layer of your skin—for reasons that aren’t completely understood—may begin to overproduce and become sticky, thereby plugging up the follicle, trapping the sebum/p.acnes in the follicle and creating an awesome breeding ground for even more bacteria. Phew! If you have acne, you know what happens next. So, in case it isn’t completely clear: what we need to do to fight acne is to ensure that that the top layer of your skin sloughs off regularly (so that the sebum doesn’t become trapped in the follicle). This is accomplished through exfoliation . Secondly, you want a product that will kill the p.acnes bacteria . Finally, it’s important to maintain moisture levels in order to normalize sebum production. That’s right, acne sufferers—we do need to moisturize!!

Adult skin that’s not regularly exfoliated may experience acne and more rapid visible aging. It is often not very vibrant in tone, and easily becomes clogged with dirt, excess oil, and dead skin cells. Blackheads are also more likely to occur. Worse, other skin care products (like serums and moisturizers) are unable to penetrate skin, so non-exfoliating folks tend to end up with dry, irritated skin. If you’re still skipping this crucial step, we have to ask: why? Not sure where to start? Check out our newest product (it was launched this past spring!), an exfoliant that’s loaded with natural ingredients like Coconut, Ginger, Ginkgo, Green Tea, and Aloe. It’s the Botanical Exfoliating Scrub . (Even better? This scrub doesn’t include plastic microbeads, a known environmental pollutant .) Related posts: Can You Exfoliate Cystic Acne?

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Jill"],"url":"http://blog.mariobadescu.com/sensitized-skin/","Text":["Unsure what’s causing your red, irritated skin? A lot of people think they have sensitive skin , but (in reality) far fewer people actually do. Why is this? It’s possible to experience the symptoms of sensitive skin due to having a skin condition known as sensitized skin. While they may sound similar, sensitive skin and sensitized skin are very different things, yet knowing the difference can make all the difference in your skin care regimen – and how well it works for your skin. Sensitive skin is a genetic trait; typically people with this predisposition are prone to asthma, allergies, and quick flushes of the skin (blushing). Those with sensitive skin typically have less pigment, a thinner epidermis, and blood vessels near the skin’s surface. This skin type is most common to those of Northern European ancestry. It is believed that sensitive skin is considered more delicate and may be the result of a less effective protective outer layer on the skin’s surface (epidermis). This can allow allergens, microbes, and irritants to reach deeper into the skin and cause flair ups. Those with lighter skin, hair, and eyes may be more prone to having sensitive skin. Darker complexions can also be sensitive, but this is less common. Sensitized skin is caused by a number of factors including lifestyle, exposure to stress, chemicals, smoking, alcohol, medical procedures, over-exfoliation, and pollution. Moreover, this skin condition occurs due to the environment. To help avoid unnecessary redness and irritation: Avoid aggressive treatments Limit exfoliation Refrain from using products with alcohol and fragrance Protect yourself from the sun Use neither too hot nor too cold water on the skin Maintain a healthy diet, and avoid triggering foods How to patch test the skin: Before using any cosmetic product, it’s important to test it out on a small area to determine how your skin will react. Apply a small amount of product to the inner arm and follow the directions on the label. Wait 24 hours and observe the area of application. If your skin appears red or irritated, use is not recommended. If your skin appears normal, the product should be safe to use. While sensitive skin and sensitized skin may be very similar in appearance, the best way to determine which type you have is to look at your skin’s history, genetic factors, and whether or not your lifestyle and environmental habits may have contributed to your skin’s current condition. Avoid irritation and inflammation by having a skincare expert analyze your skin and recommend the best products for your complexion’s needs. Have you experienced sensitized skin?

Any activity that promotes healthy circulation is obviously going to be good for your skin. After all, increased blood flow helps to nourish skin cells with oxygen and nutrients while simultaneously carrying waste products away. Exercise may also be able to help reduce oil production during stressful times. After all, oil production is directly influenced by certain stress hormones. We know that the sebaceous (oil) glands produce more sebum (oil) during stressful times. This is why you may experience oily skin and increased acne breakouts during times of high anxiety. So… does exercise help acne? Exercise eases stress, which may help to reduce acne and excess oil production as well. Note: If you’re dealing with Acne, you should also check out our Acne Repair Kit .

We’re constantly washing them, and they’re one of the few parts of our bodies that are nearly always exposed. I mean, there’s a reason women used to wear gloves all the time. Of course, I’m not suggesting a return to Victorian times, just a little tweaking of our routines to help hands look younger. You’re probably already keeping them pretty hydrated with an excellent hand cream. But what about age spots and brown splotches on the skin? If you’re interested in reducing those areas of discoloration, you can do what we do around here: use the Vitamin C Serum . It’s meant for face but can certainly be used on your hands’ skin as well. Vitamin C has powerful skin-brightening properties to help fade areas of discoloration. It also provides antioxidant protection to help guard against aging free radicals and delivers Collagen to help support skin’s structure (i.e., make it look less crepey).

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Jill"],"url":"http://blog.mariobadescu.com/exfoliation-5/","Text":["Exfoliation is crucial. I’m tempted to say that it’s the most important part of any skin care regimen, but it’s the entire package that makes the difference. So I’ll say this instead: nearly every part of your skin care routine will work better if you’re regularly exfoliating. All of our exfoliants may be used by ALL skin types. However, we do tend to recommend certain products for various skin scenarios. Here’s the breakdown: Almond & Honey Face Scrub works best for Dry/Sensitive/Mature skin. If your skin is Oily or Combination/Oily, choose between the Kiwi Face Scrub and Strawberry Face Scrub . However, if you’re experiencing an active acne breakout, use the Glycolic Foaming Cleanser instead. Oily and Combination/Oily skin types should use this 2-3 times a week in place of their usual cleanser. Those with Normal and Dry skin will benefit from using this cleanser 1-2 times a week in place of their usual cleanser. Use only once a week if the skin is very sensitive. If your skin is Dry or Combination/Dry and does not experience acne or sensitivity, the Rolling Cream Peel with AHA is an unusual option; you’ll apply a thin layer of this product and then gently rub in circles until the buildup of dead skin cells simply rolls away.

This helps create the right canvas for putting on foundation (or primer, whatever’s your next step), and helps it to stay fresh longer. Usually, when I’m running late and can’t wait the minute for it to sink in, I stand in front of my bedroom fan for a few seconds. Makeup artists are usually experts in skin care, for obvious reasons. Many of them are pretty big fans of our Moisture Magnet SPF 15 to help hydrate skin and create a solid base for makeup application.

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Jill"],"url":"http://blog.mariobadescu.com/shave-your-face/","Text":["Ladies , a question: Would you ever shave your face? A surprising number of women are doing this. If you’re not familiar with the practice, here’s how it works: with an eyebrow shaping razor (NOT the razor you usually use for body hair!) on dry skin, lightly stroke downward to remove peach fuzz as well as more substantial hair from your face. Removing all the hair from your face is meant to create a smoother canvas for makeup by getting rid of the soft, downy hairs on your skin and eliminating unwanted, obvious facial hair. In other words, even if you’ve never needed to remove hair on your chin, upper lip, or sideburn areas, this trend might still apply to you. Have you tried it? Would you? a great mask to use after shaving (or if you just have sensitive or irritated skin in general) is our Azulene Calming Mask . We also recommend not exfoliating for a few days after this type of facial shaving. You may want to avoid exfoliating ingredients in other products (like serums and toners), including Salicylic Acid and Glycolic Acid.

Let’s keep it going with a (faux) tan! As much as I love the look of a ‘healthy tan’, I’m relieved that getting a pretty glow no longer requires long hours in the sun, destroying your skin. Aren’t you? I mean, self-tanning lotions have come a long way, and these days you can pretty much be as tan (or pale) as you’d like without repercussions. Here’s the thing, though: self-tanner can be tricky, too. Be sure to prep the skin the right way to avoid muddy-looking, patchy skin. We caught up with spray-tan guru and celebrity hair and makeup artist Michelle Q when she visited our Manhattan skin care salon this summer to ask her advice. She said: “I first had my client use the Mario Badescu Raspberry Body Scrub to exfoliate all over her body and get the dead skin off before we spray tan. Love the Raspberry and Papaya aroma to this product. Secondly never forget about that precious face of yours. Using the NEW Botanical Exfoliating Scrub on the face down to chest to exfoliate dead skin as well, for a smooth and even finish from head to toe. With healing botanicals, Aloe and Green Tea your skin will glow even more after your sunless tanning application.” Don’t forget this important sefl-tan tip , either—it’s completely genius.

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Sara Kosmyna"],"url":"http://blog.mariobadescu.com/skincare-2/","Text":["Your skin is the largest organ of your body, and the first thing people see when they meet you. While resilient, it’s also vulnerable to damage from internal and external stress, as well as sun exposure and unhealthy diet and behaviors like excessive smoking and drinking. Still, not everyone wants to spend a lot of time on their skincare regimen. Sometimes, it’s more tempting to just slip into bed and forget about the day’s makeup; however, not adequately caring for your skin can do more harm than good. Sleeping with the day’s makeup leaves dirt and grime trapped on the surface of the skin, leading to clogged pores and breakouts. Whether you’re a day-at-the-spa kind of person or a wash-and-go type, the following tips will ensure that you’re giving your skin everything it needs to look and feel its healthiest. For optimal skin health, it’s crucial to cleanse, tone, and moisturize your skin twice per day—even if you do nothing else. The following skincare regimens offer two versions depending on your preferences, the basic and advanced steps to achieving a healthy and well-balanced complexion. Cleansing Minimalist: Choose a cleanser for your skin type, and cleanse in the sink once when you wake up and once before bedtime. Pat dry. Luxe: Choose a cleanser based on skin type. Morning and night, use tepid water to first warm your face and open up the pores. Then, add cleanser to your hands. Using the fingertips or the surface of the dampened sponges, apply gentle pressure while making circular movements across the skin. Cleanse for one minute. Rinse clean and repeat (only if wearing makeup). Pat dry. Toning Minimalist: After cleansing, apply toner (for your skin type) to a cotton pad and swipe quickly over congested areas. Luxe: Following cleansing, add toner to a cotton pad and swipe gently over the skin (concentrating on the t-zone and areas prone to clogged pores) in upward motions. Repeat this process until the cotton comes up clean. For a cooling sensation, fan your face to help the toner dry on the surface of your skin. Moisturizing Minimalist: During the day, apply a moisturizer to the face, avoiding the eye area. For added protection, use a formula with sun protection. In the evening, apply night cream . Luxe: After applying a day serum , massage moisturizer onto areas of the face, neck and décolletage, avoiding the eye area. Use sweeping motions. During the day, use a product with adequate sun protection. Apply body lotion and hand cream to stay thoroughly moisturized from head to toe. In the evening, after applying serum, like our Vitamin C Serum or Peptide Renewal Serum , use a nourishing night cream on areas of the face, neck and décolletage—massaging into the skin. Also work body lotion into areas like elbows, knees, hands and feet. Masks Minimalist: Once per week, apply an appropriate treatment mask with the fingers to areas of the face. Wash off, and apply toner and moisturizer. Luxe: Apply treatment masks up to three times per week with a fanned brush. Allow to settle into skin for recommended time. Rinse thoroughly and apply toner, then moisturizer. Exfoliating Minimalist: Once per week, substitute your regular facial cleanser with Glycolic Foaming Cleanser . Luxe: Up to three times per week, use an exfoliating scrub on the face and body. Work the scrub into your skin using gentle pressure and circular motions. If you are experiencing acne breakouts, substitute your regular facial cleanser with Glycolic Foaming Cleanser up to three times per week, depending on skin type. Skincare doesn’t have to be complicated. For best results, remember to cleanse, tone, and moisturize twice daily. … Related posts: Mario Badescu to the Rescue: Banish Blackheads!

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Author":["by Kimberly Yang"],"url":"http://blog.mariobadescu.com/moisturizer-5/","Text":["You could read up on everything there is to know about what ingredient X does for skin concern Y , but how do you really know which daytime moisturizer works for you? First test the moisturizer for potential reactions on either the inside of your wrist or the inside of your elbow (this preliminary step is especially important for those with sensitive skin). Gently rub the product into the skin and allow the product to remain on the skin for a full 24 hours. During that time period, be sure to check for burning, redness or irritation (remove the product immediately if any of the aforementioned occurs). If there is no negative reaction, the product should be safe to use on your face. Next, apply the moisturizer on clean skin by gently massaging the product from the center of the face outwards, using circular motions. Take your time with this step – makeup artists actually prep their models that way. It’s like a mini facial that not only feels good and helps de-stress the muscles, but also helps improve circulation to get the blood flowing. After 3-5 minutes of allowing the product to sink into the skin, touch your face. Is it tacky? Slippery? Greasy? Moisturizer should not sit on the surface: if you can still feel the product on your skin, it’s too heavy for you. Opt for a lighter or an oil-free option instead. If your skin feels rough and papery, or looks slightly cracked and flakey still, the moisturizer isn’t hydrating enough: try something with a thicker, creamier consistency. Remember to choose your moisturizer based on your skin type and your skin’s needs. Our Collagen Moisturizer (SPF 15) for example, offers lightweight, non-greasy hydration and is one of our most beloved moisturizers. But if your skin is oily and/or acne-prone, it’s simply not the right choice for you. If you’re uncertain which moisturizer is right for you, we’re always here to help.

We’ve already done our fair share of squealing and at a month’s mark on the countdown, helped turn her cubicle walls into a physical Pinterest board. I’m telling you: the excitement is actually tangible. You could taste it in the air. All that’s left are a few finishing touches before the big day. In preparation and celebration, here’s “ something old, something new; something borrowed, something blue… ” from Mario to you! (Full disclaimer: No Bridezilllas are employed Mario. We’re a (fairly) normal bunch – but only mostly because we’re aware that any unnecessary, self-induced stress breeds flare-ups in skin conditions.

Do you use a certain lotion because it was your mother’s favorite? Or keep a hand cream in your bag like your aunt always did? Did your grandmother have a vanity filled to the brim with beauty products like our pal Dani Stahl ‘ s did? Something New A new dress, a new day, a new phase in your life. Whether or not you consider it the biggest day of your life is up to you, but there’s no doubt that everything up until your wedding day is a conglomeration of steps into the next chapter of your life. Take that leap with your best everything forward. Start the journey with a series of facials – professional or at-home, DIY Facial – to renew your complexion so you can put that best face forward. Something Borrowed Let’s take one last trip down memory lane. We all have memories of our first beauty product – you know, the one that we were mesmerized by and begged our mother, aunt or older sister to let us use. Was it a certain cream? A lipstick? A perfume? For some of us, it was Mario’s Drying Lotion ! (And we’re pretty sure that some of you ladies and gents will be needing the Drying Lotion when the big day comes; it’s no big deal, let Mario help your skin while you get your beauty sleep before the big day.)
