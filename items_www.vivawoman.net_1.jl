One is the Klorane Oat Extract Gentle Dry Shampoo With Non-Aerosol Spray, which I have been using on a daily basis for over five years now. I have a very oily scalp and this dry shampoo keeps my hair looking polished by banishing the grease that clings on to my hair. In fact, I will never leave home without first using this product. Absorbs the grease and leaves the hair looking clean Made with softening and protective oat extract, Klorane Dry Shampoo keeps hair sebum at bay by penetrating the hair, absorbing dirt and grease but not drying it out. It comes with an non-aerosol nozzle for spraying but I find that highly inconvenient so I just squeeze some of the powder onto my bare hands, rub it onto my hair with my head down and brush it out after a minute or two. When brushed out, Klorane Oat Extract Dry Shampoo takes all these impurities with it, and my hair looks really clean and may I add, with volume. I just have to be careful not to get my hand or hair damp so that the powder doesn’t clump up and leave an ugly mess on the hair. Ingredients keep hair soft and manageable Klorane Oat Extract Dry Shamopoo contains Oryza Sativa(Rice), Starch(Oryza Sativa), Aluminium Starch Octenylsuccinate, Hectorite, Avena Sativa(Oat), Kernel Flour (Avena Sativa), Kaolin, Silica, Cyclodextrin, and Fragance(Parfum). There’s another version that comes with an aerosol nozzle but I’ve never tried that because I believe using hand to rub in the dry shampoo is the best method especially since I don’t want my scalp looking all whitish with this stuff. In addition, that version comes with alcohol denat which will probably dry hair out when used over long periods. Definitely more superior than talc for the hair I highly recommend this if you have oily hair like mine, or on days when you need to have great looking hair and you do not have time for a wash. Believe me, it may feel like talc but it’s way better than talc for our hair. I know because I’ve seen the difference myself. Klorane Oat Extract Gentle Dry Shampoo is available at most Guardian outlets for S$14.90. This is a good time to get it as there’s a 20% discount until the end of GSS. © www.vivawoman.net copyright notice ☺ ______________________________________________________________ Related posts: Klorane Oat Extract Dry Shampoo: a gripe & a plea Oily hair shampoo can make your hair oilier Can I use normal body or baby powder on my hair?

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Title":["Burt’s Bees Peppermint Foot Lotion"],"url":"https://www.vivawoman.net/2007/05/burts-bees-peppermint-foot-lotion/","Text":["I had wanted to buy Burt’s Bees Coconut Foot Creme but ended up getting Burt’s Bees Peppermint Foot Lotion instead. This is a basic invigorating foot lotion. If I were to compare it with Neat Feat , my other foot cream, this natural foot lotion only softens my feet, but doesn’t do as much for my cracked heels. But I like the fact that it’s a natural formula and the combination of peppermint oil, parsley leaf oil, and menthol do help to soothe and calm my tired feet at the end of the day. It also has sunflower, wheat germ, and coconut oils to soften my feet, plus emollient beeswax and vitamin E to protect against rough calluses. And most important, the texture of the lotion is just right. Not too diluted nor too rich. Hence, my hands do not feel so sticky after application. However, I’m not keen on the smell. My son hates it. Everytime I use this, he tells me it’s smelly and turns away from me. So this is good when I want to stop him from being too clingy. HA. Burt’s Bees Peppermint Foot Lotion comes in a 3.38oz tube with pretty illustrations and is available at S$18 if you purchase from Whoopeekiddies and slightly more at Dargon Dors Cosmetics, #03-1126, 32 New Market Road (People’s Park Complex). © www.vivawoman.net copyright notice ☺ ______________________________________________________________ Related posts: Burt’s Bees Radiance Body Lotion Burt’s Bee Coconut Foot Creme Burt’s Bees Lip Shimmer Burt’s Bees Pomegranate Lip Balm"],"Author":["Sesame"],"Date":["None"],"_template":"657e-4898-839c","_cached_page_id":"072be4d00973ce1fb76d975bdda0d5766f1298a7"}
{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Title":["Burt’s Bee Coconut Foot Creme"],"url":"https://www.vivawoman.net/2007/07/burts-bee-coconut-foot-creme/","Text":["Two days ago when I went for a pedicure, I was delighted to hear compliments about my feet. The pedicurist had remarked that the condition of my feet is very good, with minimal cracked heel marks. Coming from someone who touches different feet all day long, this really made me happy. And of course I have to thank the latest addition to my feet care. Burt’s Bee Coconut Foot Creme . It’s definitely an excellent product and I should have gotten this way earlier. Burt’s Bees Coconut Foot Creme has rosemary to heal, and peppermint to purify. It’s rich with vegetable glycerin and coconut oil to heal as well as protect the driest and most neglected feet. The texture is ultra emollient-rich but surprisingly, the smell is quite pleasant. It smells well, exactly like coconut of course and is definitely better than the Peppermint Foot Lotion I’ve reviewed earlier. Before using this product, I usually ensure that I’ve had my feet, especially the rough and callused skin on my heels polished either with a pumice stone or foot scrub. Then before retiring to bed, I apply the Coconut Foot Creme liberally on the feet, rubbing well into the heels before putting on a pair of socks. The creme feels a bit warm on contact but it’s really slight but most important is the result is almost immediate as I can feel the skin on my heels really soft the next morning. In fact, I’ll let you on in one secret. I love to touch my heels quite a lot now! Heh. Thanks to the wonderful natural product from Burt’s Bees. I bought the 4.34oz foot creme from whoopeekiddies.com at S$15.50. The only problem I can find about this product is that it leaves a greasy film on my hand after application. But still, I rate this five out of five! © www.vivawoman.net copyright notice ☺ ______________________________________________________________ Related posts: Burt’s Bees Peppermint Foot Lotion Marie-Veronique Organics Creme de Jour DIY Beauty: mood lifting lavender tea foot soak DIY Beauty: L’Occitane Ma Creme Nature"],"Author":["Sesame"],"Date":["None"],"_template":"657e-4898-839c","_cached_page_id":"1b9632ba36ebcb2641320eea89b43f5c67634c29"}

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Title":["Pretty feminine in pink: Principessa Beauty"],"url":"https://www.vivawoman.net/2011/03/pretty-feminine-in-pink-principessa-beauty/","Text":["Some time end of last year, Liang Shing of i-lovemylife.com contacted me and asked if I was interested to review some products from Principessa Beauty because she was planning to bring in to her organic online store. I’ve seen this brand around in Sephora with their pretty pink packaging but was under the impression that they’re mostly makeup. But I later found out that Principessa Beauty carries mostly bath and body items, hair products, lip balms and lip glosses plus fragrances that smell delicious. I was given three of their best sellers to try out and here’s my thoughts on them. Products are free from parabens, petroleum and phthalate I know that we shouldn’t let outward appearance belie the content but going by the pretty pink packaging, I was really expecting this to be one of those brands full of chemical synthetics. While I wouldn’t call their formulation fully natural, but I was pleasantly surprised that the brand formulates their products free from parabens, petroleum, phthalate. I also learnt that the company do not test their formulations on animals and they strive to be eco friendly by ensuring that their products are all 100% biodegradable and their packaging are reusable and/or recyclable. The company also claims to be carbon neutral, which means they have a zero footprint. Principessa Bianco Breeze Hair & Body Powder 125g/S$42 Ingredients: Zea Mays (Corn) Starch, Silica, Parfum, Phenoxyethanol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Organic Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Organic Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract. While it’s called a hair and body powder, this is positioned as a dry shampoo and is apparently, Principessa Beauty’s award winning product. I’m an avid user of dry shampoo and so I know what to expect for a product like that. It should cut out all the grease on my hair and yet, leave my hair voluminous and manageable. This product does get rid of the grease for a good part of the day, and leaves my hair very manageable with some increase in volume. But the staying powder isn’t as good as compared to my usual Klorane’s dry shampoo. It is also very expensive. But it smells very sweet and would definitely appeal those who love to use body powder to keep themselves smelling fresh and amazing all day long. A mini size of 30g is also available at S$20.50. Principessa Cattiva Diva Silky Hand Cream 100ml/S$26 Ingredients: Aqua (Water), Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Carthamus Tinctorious (Safflower) Oil, Prunus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG-100 Stearate,Cetearyl Alcohol, Limnanthes Alba (Meadowfoam) Seed Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamine E), Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Extract, Daucus Carota (Carrot) Extract, Prunus Persica (Peach) Extract, Glycerin, Dimethicone, Sodium Hyaluronate, Aloe Barbadensis Extract (Aloe Vera), Fragrance, Ceteareth 20, C12 15 Alkyl Benzoate, Isopropyl Myristate, Steareth 2, Steareth 21, Benzophenone 3, Tetrasodium EDTA, Triethanolamine, Sodium Polyacrylate, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexlglycerin, Hexylene Glycol, CI 17200. I’m quite a sucker for hand cream and so I was eager to test out this one. The first few times I used this, I didn’t like the smell for it was pretty overpowering. It’s said to be scented with belloccia, which is a sweet vanilla smell. But after using it for a week or so, I got use to the scent and am quite happy to rub this on my dry hands whenever I need some moisturizing for this one makes my hands feel very silky soft without stickiness or greasiness. Definitely good to use when I’m driving for it leaves no oily stains on my steering wheel. The 100ml tube is quite huge to lug around but the good thing is, a 15ml Mini Cattiva Diva Silky Hand Cream is available for S$12.50. Principessa Piccola Perfume Oil (Belloccia) 6ml/S$56 Another award winning product, this one is strictly fragrance and it smells exactly like the hand cream. So if you like to be walking around smelling like sweet vanilla, then you will like this. Belloccia means irresistible in Italian and is described as a seductively sweet concoction that is both extremely luxurious and intoxicatingly delicious, opening with ethereal nuances of peach and vanilla flower, cascades into middle notes of night blooming jasmine and ylang ylang and bottom notes of sandalwood and warm amber dry down to a warm, sensual finish. It’s a pure perfume oil and so, there’s good lasting power to the scent. I like that it comes in a roll-on mini bottle but I find the price awfully expensive though. Besides Bellocia, the other scent available at i-lovemylife.com is Isolina, Principessa Beauty’s signature scent. Special promotion for Viva Woman readers Overall, I do like the three products I’ve tried in terms of their performance but I have to admit that while they all smell delicious, the scent are all very strong. In addition, I also find their prices somewhat steep. But the range is definitely luxurious and pampering and the good thing is, Liang Shing has offered a special 10% off all Principessa Beauty’s products at her online store. No minimum purchase is required and if you spend above $50 at her store (after discount), you can get free home delivery. This offer is valid till 31 May 2011 and the promo code to use is Viva_PB .

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Title":["Beauty blogging: must beauty bloggers be beautiful?"],"url":"http://www.vivawoman.net/2009/04/must-beauty-bloggers-be-young-beautiful/","Text":["Okay ladies, I have a question for all of you. Must beauty bloggers have good skin? Or must beauty bloggers be young? I’m asking this because I’ve seen two comments these two days that bugged me. Someone who has been reading my blog but not met me had asked me for my age. She guessed my age to be in the late 20s initially and then subsequently commenting that I cannot be older than 33. This person is a professional contact and her intentions are kind. However, that got me thinking. I don’t know how she derived those numbers but perhaps in the minds of most people, beauty bloggers must be young. Then today, I saw some traffic coming from Cozycot and I checked. A reader had kindly posted a link of my entry on Sustainable Youth which I wrote about yesterday to share with the forumers. However, one of the forum commenters discredited my post by criticizing my skin, highlighting the fact that I have a lot of pigmentation and casting serious doubts on my recommendations. Sure, I know I do not have good skin. I have said that. However, I have also said that I am not young and I have bad pigmentation due to years of adventure traveling and not wearing sunscreen. I’m not upset because she criticized my skin. I’m just upset that my intentions to share something exciting is deemed negatively. And my question is, must beauty bloggers have good skin? I blog about my beauty journey and experience. I’m not blogging to show off my skin. On the contrary, I’m blogging to improve the state of my skin. I never intended this blog to be personal. However, it has evolved into something different and I love all the interactions with my readers. I love how some of you tell me that the stuff I recommend works for you or how some of you come and share your beauty tips freely. So today I am saddened. My beauty blogging passion is dampened so to speak. The fear I always have when I started this blog has reared its ugly head. Don’t worry though. I have no plans to stop blogging. But I might be more careful with using before and after pictures though I thought they are certainly more believable than words. Leon suggested that I reveal my age but I don’t know. Should I or shouldn’t I? I have that “Andy Lau” syndrome if you know what I mean.

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Title":["Certified organic ingredients ≠ certified organic"],"url":"https://www.vivawoman.net/2011/05/certified-organic-ingredients-%e2%89%a0-certified-organic/","Text":["I’m quite sure many of us are quite confused with the various organic certification and standards in the market for skin care and cosmetics. Unless you read the labels carefully and do your research, chances are, you maybe green washed into thinking that some products are certified organic when they are not exactly so. For example, I see more and more products these days bearing self-made logos that state their ingredients are certified organic, which can mislead some consumers to think that the products are certified organic. I’ve even come across products labeled as such and yet, only one ingredient is certified organic. That’s downright deceptive! Bearing seals from authorized organic certification bodies Organic means a product contains all-natural, non-synthetic substances that are grown without using conventional pesticides or fertilizer, biotechnology or radiation. When a product is labelled as certified organic, it should bear recognizable logos or seals from the established certifying authorities worldwide. There are quite a few but those that I see more frequently are: USDA Organic Products must contain 95 to 100% certified organic ingredients. Ecocert for natural & organic cosmetic label A minimum of 95% of all plant-based ingredients in the formula and a minimum of 10% of all ingredients by weight must come from organic farming. Ecocert for natural cosmetic label A minimum of 50% of all plant-based ingredients in the formula and a minimum of 5% of all ingredients by weight must come from organic farming. UK Soil Association Certification Besides being free of toxic chemicals/processes, formulations must contain at least 90% certified organic ingredients. Australian Certified Organic Products must contain 95% certified organic ingredients with the remaining 5% being restricted to natural ingredients which must meet stringent requirements. In Australia this includes no synthetic ingredients at all (including no nature identical). Synthetic free In addition, certified organic products should be free of synthetic emollients, synthetic humectants, synthetic emulsifiers, synthetic surfactants, synthetic preservatives, artificial dyes, colorings, and additives. And if you go by the percentage or organic ingredients allowed for certification, Ecocert is not at all impressive if you are looking for a product containing mostly certified organic ingredients. But if you’re just into natural ingredients, then a product certified under Ecocert is good enough. Expensive to get certification Decisions to get such seals from the certifying bodies essentially lie with the cost. I’m not about to go into the specifics but I know it’s very expensive to obtain organic certification and this is why some companies do not obtain the labeling although many of their ingredients used in their products maybe from organic sources. Hence, the next best thing to do is to highlight that their products use certified organic ingredients. Technically speaking, that’s above board; the only issue is that the market is not mature enough and some consumers may not be aware of the truth and think they’re paying for a product that is certified organic. Your view So are you very particular that your organic products must bear logos and seals from the better known certifying bodies? For me, it’s good but I don’t want to have to pay an arm and a leg for such product. In fact, I don’t even need the product to be organic as I’m good with products with natural ingredients that are free of synthetics. However, I definitely take issues with companies that abuse the word ‘organic’ and use it to name their products when their products cannot be even considered as natural in the first place. © www.vivawoman.net copyright notice ☺ ______________________________________________________________ Related posts: Get a free 15ml certified organic Jojoba oil Mukti: certified organic skincare from Australia Why some organic ingredients maybe “useless” Organic alcohol denat in organic skin care?"],"Author":["Sesame"],"Date":["None"],"_template":"657e-4898-839c","_cached_page_id":"acc886447fc783f833f84397fb32e298bb87ec4b"}
{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Title":["What’s in a good sunblock?"],"url":"https://www.vivawoman.net/2006/12/whats-in-a-good-sunblock/","Text":["For those of us who live in the tropical region, sunblock is a necessity. But do we really know if the one we’re wearing is effective? First, you might like to know that sunblock is actually different from sunscreen. A sunblock physically blocks the sun’s UV radiation of the skin, both UVA and UVB. Like the way clothes, umbrella and trees work to shade us. The most well-known chemical sunblock is zinc oxide and it scatters, reflects, and physically blocks UV radiation. Other commonly used sunblocks are talc, titanium dioxide, and red vetenary petrolatum. It used to be that many older chemical sunblocks are cosmetically unacceptable because they’re opaque and the skin cannot be seen through the sunblock. Worst still, they’re greasy and clog pores. Fortunately, a new sunblock formulation has been developed that contains micronized titanium dioxide and it is almost invisible and still has good UV blocking capabilities. So according to my dematologist, an effective sunblock should have these two properties: zinc oxide and titanium dioxide. I wished I had known this fact earlier. Because before I consulted him, I was using a salon type of sunblock which had those two properties but the formulation was too greasy. Later, I switched to another so-called high quality sunblock which shouts of high sun protection factor (SPF) but did not contain those properties. Which means, the sunblock wasn’t sunblock but really only a cosmetic sunscreen and my skin wasn’t getting much protection. And the thing about SPF is also rather confusing. For example, one might think that a sunblock with factor 20 protect them from the sun twenty fold for up to two hours. However, the truth is that they will only get that amount of protection if they put on the same amount of lotion as the manufacturer did when testing it, which is very thick. But research has shown that most people use considerably less, and are typically getting one-third of the protection they think they are. So what do these all really mean to us the average consumer? According to my dermatologist, ensure that your sunblock has the two properties I’ve mentioned. Try to re-apply your sunblock again sometime in the midday if you can. Avoid basking in the sun if possible. Always wear your sunblock even when indoors. And if you like to know the sunblock he recommended me, it’s SkinCeuticals’ Physical UV Defense with SPF30, which is available only via prescription at selected clinics. © www.vivawoman.net copyright notice ☺ ______________________________________________________________ Related posts: Is sunblock different from sunscreen?

My apologies for not being to answer to everyone individually but I like all of you to know that I appreciate all your kind words, encouraging comments and goodwill . I feel a lot better knowing that all of you share similar thoughts that beauty knows no boundaries and reaffirm what I thought earlier – age is irrelevant and imperfections are acceptable. I am not a beauty guru or expert but I feel happy sharing all my findings and excitement when it comes to the topic on beauty. So blog on I shall! *** Erase smudges from mascara Anyway, during the makeup demonstration last week by Taiwanese celebrity stylist Kevin, he showed us how to use a cotton swab or cotton bud to erase mistakes made during our makeup. The model whom he put on the makeup had some smudges coming from her mascara. What he did was to continue putting on the makeup for her, and then when he was done, he used a cotton swab to gently roll on the area of the smudge. That rolling action lifted the stain and the smudge was erased completely. The trick according to him was to wait for the mascara to dry up as it would become powdery, making it easy for the cotton swab to do the job. I guess some of you who are adept in makeup probably already know this tip. However, judging from the response from the compere and some members from the floor, it looks like many were hearing this tip for the first time. Remove excess or blotchy foundation from the face Although I hardly use mascara, but I found the cotton swab great for wiping out thick and spotty foundation too. I just have to roll the bud on the area where I dabbed too much foundation and within seconds, the powder will be lifted up and I can touch up properly again. Before learning about this tip, I kept using a tissue paper to wipe and the patch always got worst. So a cotton swab or bud is great for correcting makeup mistakes whether it is from foundation, eye shadow or mascara. It’s definitely a makeup necessity and it might be a good idea to bring a few with you at all times! © www.vivawoman.net copyright notice ☺ ______________________________________________________________ Related posts: 10 skin care mistakes made when I was younger Can you use a cotton pad to exfoliate your skin?

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Title":["Why you should not steam your face so often"],"url":"https://www.vivawoman.net/2008/09/why-you-should-not-steam-your-face-often/","Text":["I have a phobia of having my face steamed during facials. When I close my eyes and feel the hot steam hovering over my face, I always fear the machine will malfunction and I will get hot water splashed on my face instead. Okay, that’s pretty irrational. I know. But I always have this feeling that steaming isn’t that great for my face even though it is supposed to open up the opens for better cleansing and some experts even claim steam moisturizes the outer layers of the skin. Perhaps it’s true that the skin will feel plump and saturated with the water coming from steam but from the various books I’ve read, the heat coming from steam is actually bad for our skin. Hot water can leave skin feeling dry and irritated, plus may cause dry skin types to overproduce more oil. In addition, it will aggravate broken capillaries on the skin too. According to Paula Begoun in The Beauty Bible, wet heat is deceptive. “Because the surface layer of skin likes water so much, hot water can enter the skin, stay there, and cause a burn-like reaction.” In addition, I also read from the Acne Magazine that excessive facial steaming may actually leave people with acne proned skin to break out more because the steaming action may actually swell the skin’s top layer, which can trap oil, dirt and bacteria in the pores and cause acne postules to form. It can also cause inflammation. Well, I’m not saying that you can’t steam your face but it’s best to steam in moderation. Once a month during a facial is probably fine. In addition, if you’re using some DIY steaming therapy, be careful that the steam is not too hot. And frequent sessions at the suana is a bad idea as it could leave your skin more dehydrated. But personally, I think it’s fine not to have my face steam. I’ll rather keep it steam free.

I haven’t bought them for a long time and have lost track of the new products. Help to keep away the shine I know many women absolutely must have one of these in their cosmetic pouch. In fact, I used to buy the Clean & Clear Oil Absorbing Sheets but after using them for a few years, I just decided to stop one day. I just found that they’re a waste of money and don’t make much of a difference to help control my facial oil anywhere. Despite what some of them suggest, facial blotters merely keep away the shine, temporarily. I guess it was kind of fun to see the oily stains on the sheet but really, a tissue paper did about the same job for me. In fact, an ex male colleague suggested I use the kitchen paper towel in jest because it is a lot cheaper! Do not use excessively A funny thing I’ve heard is that using such blotters can contribute to more oil on your face. I don’t think this is true because you’re merely using these sheets to blot away excess oil, unless of course you’re over using them and keeping your face too dry as a result. Because a dry face will produce even more oil to counter its extreme state of dryness. And for goodness sake, these are blotters; so don’t rub your skin with them! Avoid powdered facial blotters Of course if you like using these facial oil blotters, by all means, continue because they do absorb facial oil and keep away excess shine. The only thing you want to take note is to avoid those powdered facial blotters because the layer of powder will just clog up your pores and potentially cause more skin problems later!

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Title":["Can you use body lotion on your face?"],"url":"https://www.vivawoman.net/2008/10/can-you-use-body-lotion-on-your-face/","Text":["Why would anyone want to use their hand lotion or body moisturizer on their face you may ask. Well, out of convenience is my guess. Like my husband, who used the Sukin Hydrating Body Lotion I passed him and applied it all over, including his face! And the result? Clogged pores and a mini eruption of pimples. In fact, he didn’t even realized the reason until I questioned him. Body lotions are richer than face moisturizers I had to explain to him that there is a big difference between facial and body moisturizers even if their texture seem similar. First, the skin condition between our face and our body is different with the skin on our hands and body typically drier than our face. Hence, the body lotion only needs to hydrate the dry skin and are thus formulated to be richer. I haven’t seen any body lotion that states that it is “non-comedogenic” although you see a lot of this on creams and moisturizers for the face, which means it won’t clog your pores. Some ingredients can clog pores Even if the ingredients used are the same, the concentration could be different. For example, if you compare the ingredients of Sukin Hydrating Body Lotion and Sukin Facial Moisturizer, they look almost similar but some of their order are different. The concentration of shea butter and cocoa butter are higher for the body lotion since they’re listed first. And cocoa butter has been widely rated as having a fairly high propensity to clog pores. Sukin Hydrating Body Lotion Ingredients : purified water, an organic blend of aloe vera, nettle, burdock and horsetail, sesame oil, cetyl alcohol (vegetable), ceteareth-20 (vegetable), glycerin (vegetable), shea butter, cocoa butter, jojoba oil, rosehip oil, avocado oil, wheat germ oil, vitamin E, sodium hydroxymethylglycinate (suttocide), grapeseed extract, tangerine essential oil, mandarin oil, lavender oil, vanilla extract. Sukin Facial Moisturiser Ingredients : purified water, an organic blend of aloe vera, nettle, burdock and horsetail, sesame oil, palm kernel alcohol (vegetable), ceteareth-20 (vegetable), glycerin (vegetable), vitamin E, avocado oil, jojoba oil, cocoa butter, rosehip oil, shea butter, wheat germ oil, tangerine essential oil, mandarin oil, sodium hydroxymethylglycinate (suttocide), citric acid, grapefruit seed extract, lavender, vanilla extract. So you can apply your facial moisturizer on your body but you should never apply your body lotion on your face.

I only found out now that it’s because the lash-extending mascara have fibres that are not suitable for contact lens users like myself. In fact, I recalled that my friend Ashes had the same exact problem using this particular mascara too. Bypass lash-extending mascaras if you wear contact lenses. Manufacturers often brag that the microfibers in those products give your lashes an extra boost. But those little particles can also become trapped beneath your lens and scratch the cornea, increasing the risk of infection. ( source ) If you wear contact lenses, you want to avoid mascaras that promise to build up the thickness and length of your lashes with silicone and fibers. Because if one of these lash-building particles falls into your eyes, you risk having your eyes infected. And the best is to select hypoallergenic, nonwaterproof mascaras that are less likely to irritate your eyes. As for me, I’ve long avoided using such mascaras. That’s why the Natural Brown Dejavu Fiberwig I got from Hong Kong eons ago is still unopened till now. © www.vivawoman.net copyright notice ☺ ______________________________________________________________ Related posts: Do eyeliners & mascaras cause eyelashes to drop?

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Title":["Dual skincare approach for combination skin"],"url":"https://www.vivawoman.net/2008/10/dual-skincare-approach-for-combination-skin/","Text":["My skin type is combination, which means I have a blend of oily and dry skin. The patch on my T-zone from the forehead down to the nose and chin is oily while my cheeks are dry. So this means that my T-zone needs too be treated like oily skin while my cheeks should be treated like dry skin. In terms of skin care, I should really be using a dual approach and deal with the different areas of skin individually with different products. This is because I found out that treating my entire complexion like oily skin will leave the dry areas even drier and tighter while treating it only like dry skin can provoke excess oiliness. But in actual fact, I have always used one product for my entire face and it is not until recently that I started to make a slight switch to this routine. Here, let me share my 10 skin care tips for combination skin: 1. Cleanse the T-zone more thoroughly I like the squeaky clean feeling on my skin after cleansing and hence, I’ve always like to use a gentle foaming cleanser. In the morning when my face is free from makeup, I just use the foaming cleanser but in the evening, I use the double cleansed method where I will first apply an oil or cream cleanser to get rid of my makeup first. When using the oil or cream cleanser, I tend to massage more into my eye area and my cheeks that are drier. This is then followed by massaging my entire face with a gentle foaming facial wash. When lathering, I focus more on my T-zone, massaging a little more into the oily areas before splashing clean wtih cool water. 2. Alternate between two different types of cleansers If you like, you can also alternate between an oil or cream cleanser and the foaming facial wash to have a more balanced approach; using only one for the day and the other only in the night. In fact I started testing out the oil cleansing method and this is exactly what I do. I use the foaming facial cleanser only in the morning and in the evening when I come back from work, I use an oil based cleanser and rinse out with warm water. 3. Apply more toner on the T-zone Although I like to tone my entire face, the first step is always to apply the toner on my T-zone with my saturated cotton cool pad. So by the time the cotton pad reaches my drier cheeks, the amount of toner is much lesser. Sometimes when I’m under stress, my T-zone gets excessively oily an hour or two after washing. To combat this oiliness, I use a toner to wipe the excess oil from the T-zone lightly, provided I’m not wearing my makeup. If I’m wearing makeup, I use a blotter or tissue paper instead. 4. Apply two different types of toner on different zones Another approach I’ve read is to use two different strengths of toner to deal with the differing skin types. A stronger astringent toner for the T-zone and a milder toner for the dry zone. I haven’t tried this method before although I might try using witch hazel on my T-zone soon just to see how it fares. 5. Moisturize more of the drier patches and less of the T-zone I have always kept moisturizing my T-zone to a minimum. In the past when I used a day moisturizer, I’ve always picked a lightweight lotion that is non-oily. And increasingly, I don’t use a day moisturizer because my sunscreen is quite rich and I tend to apply more on my cheeks and lesser on my T-zone. This is also true at night when I use my richer night cream. Concentrate on moisturizing my cheeks and applying sparingly on my T-zone. 6. Moisturize drier face patches with carrier oil I’ve started using the Sea Buckthorn Oil at night but only around my eyes and some parts of my cheeks. Because I’m also trying to get rid of some lines on my forehead, I also apply a little of it on those lines. Generally, I’ve avoided using carrier oils on my nose and chin unless there are some scars or blemishes I’m trying to heal. In those instances, I just dab a little of the oil and massage into the spot. 7. Exfoliate more on the T-zone Because my T-zone tends to suffer from clogged pores due to the oily complexion, I always scrub more into that area. In fact, I also exfoliate my nose area a few times a week just to keep it cleaner. 8. Use different facial masks for the face Okay, I have always used one type of mask across my face, whether it is a moisturizing mask, an exfoliating mask, a peel off mask or a clay mask. The reason is some of these masks perform dual functions like refreshing the oily areas, clearing the clogged pores and nourishing the dry skin. However, if you wish, you can separate your mask according to your skin zone. Like using a moisturizing mask on the cheeks only and a clay mask on the T-zone. 9. Hydrate more of the drier skin patches with face mist I carry a facial mist all the time in my bag and in the day under air-conditioned environment, I will spritz some of it to keep my face refreshed. I find that using more of it around my cheeks is good to keep them hydrated but if I squirt a bit more on my T-zone, the oil and the mist make my makeup become streaky. 10. Use a primer to control oil on the T-zone I don’t use primer everyday; only on days when I need to keep my oily T-zone under better control. So before applying my makeup, I use a primer specifically on my T-zone. It doesn’t keep the oil completely under control but at the least, I can be shine free for a good part of the day. Combination skin does not necessarily mean an oily T-zone and dry cheeks. It could be other combinations. If you’re unsure of your skin type or combination pattern, you can do a test by pressing a tissue paper to your un-toned and un-moisturized face an hour after washing. Any greasy patches on the tissue signify oily areas. So anyone out there with combination skin type like mine?

Or maybe taking time to plan ahead for 2011? Well, if you are, let’s do a quick check: do you have any of your hands rested on your chin, on one side of your face or maybe both sides while doing so? Or maybe you’re so comfortable that you’re about to fall asleep on one of your hands even? Well, if you’ve got this habit of resting your face on your hands or should I say propping your face with your hands, then one advice I have for you moving on to 2011 is, kick this habit in the new year. Why? Well, whatever you’re doing is causing that part of your face to be inevitably pressed and in the long run, may affect the face shape or worst, cause wrinkles to form or lines to deepen. And I said MAY only because I’m speaking from my own experience. Like the first top left picture, I had this habit of resting my left hand on my left cheek while thinking in the past and guess what. I noticed that I have some fine lines near the nasolabial groove on that side of the face. There could be other factors contributing to those lines but I’m pretty sure my hand had a part in it.

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Title":["Share: what time do you wash your hair?"],"url":"https://www.vivawoman.net/2011/01/share-what-time-do-you-wash-your-hair/","Text":["Earlier this week, I picked up a Chinese book in the local bookstore about beauty and came across some interesting information regarding the best time to wash our hair. It stated specifically that we shouldn’t be washing our hair early in the morning and late in the night. Oh geez…I wash my hair first thing in the morning when I jump out of bed every day for almost my entire life now! In fact, some days as early as 4am! So what gives? Cold temperature not good for our head According to the book, the temperature is a lot colder in the early morning and late in the night so it isn’t really good for our health if we wash our hair then. It doesn’t say what problems it’ll create but I imagine it may be something connected to PHD – Permanent Head Damage! Okay, okay, just kidding…the fact that I’m still able to string coherent sentences here after so many years of washing my hair in the wee hours means I don’t have PHD. Not good to wash your hair just before you sleep But the author of the book did state that if we do wash our hair during those ungodly time of the day, then it’s best to blow dry our hair. This is particularly so for those who wash their hair late in the night as it is really not advisable to go to bed with wet hair. This one I believe, and based on some old wives’ tale, I think sleeping with a head of wet hair might contribute to headaches and migraines. But truly, going to bed with wet hair might cause more problems such as hair getting into an odd shape, having bad smell and your pillows turning moldy! One hour before or after meal So what’s the best time to wash our hair? Well, from what I read, it’s one hour before or after dinner. Okay, don’t ask me how this came about and there is definitely no research to back this one up. My guess is that it’s got something to do with the body temperature and hence, I think it should be good to wash your hair one hour before or after lunch too. And if we go by the logic behind not washing our hair in the wee hours, then I suppose if you wash them in warm water and blow dry your hair with warm air immediately after, you’ll be forever saved from PHD.

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Title":["Six different ways to apply skin care products"],"url":"https://www.vivawoman.net/2011/01/six-different-ways-to-apply-skin-care-products/","Text":["Recently, I placed an order for a product that I didn’t like so much in terms of application. I had some problems applying the product the first time but because I had loved the results from using it, I decided to re-order the product and then apply it a different way. This first time around, I blended the product into my palm and then patted on my face using my fingers instead of sweeping the lotion over my face! It was a lot easy and better this time! So this got me thinking of writing this post about the different ways we can apply our skin care products. 1. Apply a pea size amount with your fingers This should be the most common way where you squeeze a pea size amount into the center of your palm, and then using the fingertips of the other hand to apply onto your face. This is probably the method I use most frequently and I typically start by applying the product onto both my cheek area before my chin area, my forehead and then moving down to my nose. I usually use this when applying face cream and sunscreen. 2. Warm the cream using the center of your palm This method is good for really thick cream, which I learnt when I was using Creme de Lar Mer a couple of years back. Because the cream is so thick, you should use a pea size amount or even lesser, place it into the center of your palm then rub, or pat both your palms together to “warm up the cream”. Certain creams may liquify but others may just turn a little less creamy, which allows you to easily apply onto your face without the thick consistency. 3. Apply 5 dots on your face and blend I hope I won’t offend anyone by saying this but somehow, I associate this method with the old school of skincare. In the past, many beauty consultants seem to encourage this approach of skin care application and it’s even stated on the instructions of some products. The 5 dots denote applying a small blob of cream on your two cheek area, your nose, your forehead and your chin. I believe it is still a common skin care application technique and I find myself going back to this approach when I apply my face mask. However, I tend to apply more than usual when I use this 5 dots method. 4. Pat the cream or lotion into your face This is a common way to apply facial toner if you don’t use a cotton pad. Pour the toner into the center of your palm and then using your fingers to lightly pat or tap into your face. Actually, I’m not very gentle whenever I use this method. I literally slap my face in an energetic fashion whenever I apply my face toner. It’s kind of for fun and at the same time, I believe it helps to aid blood circulation and increase absorption of the toner. 5. Press the lotion or oil into your face If you’ve use some of the Japanese lotions, then you should be quite familiar with this technique. Again, you’ll pour the lotion into the center of your palm and then using the other palm, press both hands together and then continue to press the lotion into all areas of your face. I use this method when applying my facial oil. 6. Massage the cream, lotion or oil into your face This is actually an extension of any of the above methods, followed by a more intensive massage on your face. I do that using my facial oil. After I have pressed the oil onto my entire face, I then proceed to massage the oil on my cheek area, using one or two hands in an upward, outward sweeping fashion starting from my jawline to the area near my ear.

A sunscreen? A handcream? A mirror? A hand sanitizer? A pack of tissue? Or something else? Well, mine is a comb. Heh. Many people don’t know but I belong to that category that will potentially ask anyone I’ve just met: “is my hair messy”? Okay, okay, I don’t ask. Very often, I’ll just whip out my comb and brush my hair. Friends who know me well are not surprised that this is the first thing I do when I meet them. My hair must look neat at all times! So yes, I detest fan and strong wind that mess up my hair! I do try to comb my hair in private, like in the restrooms, but some times I really can’t and I’ll be whipping out my comb when I am: – taking a crowded lift. – traveling up or down an escalator. – traveling in a crowded train. – peering into the side mirror of a car. – looking into my reflection at a retail store. Ha. I think you get the idea. I can be walking and combing my hair too and if I am able, I’ll be glad to bring my comb when I’m in the middle of a swimming pool too.

I don’t stay with my mom now so I don’t know what she’ll say if she finds out that I spend like 30 minutes each morning to prep my skin and hair. That’s probably well too long by her standard. So what is my 30 minutes spent on? Well, I wake up around 6am daily and as most of you know, that time of the morning is cold! First 20 minutes – soak under warm running water to get my system ready – shampoo my hair, sometimes twice – condition my hair, leaving the conditioner on for a minute – bathe, bathe, bathe – wash my face once – massage my face for 1 to 2 minutes Next 5 minutes – towel my face dry – towel my body dry – spritz my face with toner, leaving it dripping for a minute – brush my hair, prepping it for blow drying – pat the toner dry – tap eye cream around eye area – apply face oil or moisturizer on face & neck – apply sunscreen on face Last 5 minutes – blow and style my hair – apply deodorant – apply body moisturizer, mainly on arms and legs – put on clothes In the evening, I don’t wash my hair again and so the routine is really much shorter and that includes taking a shower; probably takes me around 15 minutes because I have additional skin care needs for the night.

Yesh, it’s full of goodness because it will soften dry skin, cure your skin blemishes, and get rid of your acne. Why…it’s the ultimate anti-aging serum! A load of bull? Oh so disgusting? Well, haven’t you heard of urine therapy that has been practiced in various cultures since early history? I know some people even drink baby’s urine! Using baby’s pee to get rid of rashes and blemishes I’m not so sure about the origins in other cultures but when it comes to the Chinese, this is quite a common practice, especially with the older generation. You know that rashes and blemishes are a common sight with the newborns and I’ve personally seen my mom wiped various nieces’ and nephews’ faces with warm, wet diapers, just removed from their butts. Nothing too weird there. I’ve wiped my son’s face with his own pee before and yes, his rashes and blemishes cleared up real quickly after that because I didn’t recall doing that for a prolonged period. Did I try? So going by the same principle, we adults can also wipe our face with baby’s pee! Oh no, I didn’t try…at that time, my face was relatively good and I haven’t heard that baby’s pee can help remove pigmentation spots or I might have given it a go. Heheh. So no need to wrinkled up your nose at me! Urine contains Urea Apparently, the reason urine works is because it contains Urea, an ingredient that can cure various skin ailments and therefore found in many skincare products in its synthetic form. With matured urine, I guess there is more bacteria and waste but a baby’s urine is considered as healthy and sterile – and so it has that added anti-inflammatory properties. Pee from a newborn is apparently, the best! Tried it? Okay, I haven’t got any research and science to back me up about using urine as a skin therapy. This is all written for fun. But well, I know there are probably some people who will resort to this. If you or someone you know has tried using baby’s urine on their skin, let us know how it has gone.

One such is from Aleen, who has sensitive skin and she was actually too disciplined with her skin care routine. Well, in her words, she called herself a paranoid. But I don’t think she’s alone having such an issue as we have, one time or another, fell into the trap of being “over the top” and exercised too much zeal in our skin care routines. Over cleansing and over exfoliating I double cleanse every time I wash my face, twice a day, although not using makeup and exfoliate 3 times a week. I even use seperate facial and body towel, change my pillowsheets every 2 weeks and even have another layer of clean sheet to cover it. I eat a lot of fruits and vegetables, ate vit E supplement and wash my hands very frequently. I also have at least 7 hours of sleep every night and I trim my fingernails short, always. And I stay away from peanuts..! I’m a paranoid. My problem is that recently my skin is constantly having major breakouts, especially on the cheeks after starting as little whiteheads. My friends advised me to lessen the frequency of cleansing and exfoliating but that seemed to cause more breakouts when the skin gets oilier. (she believes that my skin is losing its “bacteria fighting ability” since I’m being TOO CLEAN!) Actually, her friend was right and I also told her that over exfoliating can make her skin dry and that’s why it is leading to more production of oil. So my advice to her was to cut down her exfoliation to once a week and to get an SLS/SLES free cleanser amongst other things. You can read the details in the comments section of this entry . About a week later, this is what she wrote: Improvements after a week My skin’s getting better and fairer.. amazingly! (in just like a week plus? super instant results..!) I’ve bought a facial foam with no SLS.. it feels clean and i don’t really need to double cleanse as often as I did before. I applied the water+oatmeal mask every 2-3 days and it really feels refreshing..! It smoothens my skin and somehow exfoliates off the dried and dead skin. I also reduce exfoliating session to once a week. I’m still using toner and moisturiser but surprisingly they don’t cause anymore breakouts recently. Exercise moderation and balance So ladies, while you take care of your skin and be on top of it, it’s best not to be over the top. Personally, I restrict myself to cleansing just twice a day and I only exfoliate more than twice a week if I have excessive breakouts. Otherwise, it’s just once or twice a week. When it comes to applying facial mask, I have tried using one consistently for a week before stopping and then resuming to once or twice a week. At the end of the day, I think moderation and balance is better than being excessive when it comes to our skin care routines. © www.vivawoman.net copyright notice ☺ ______________________________________________________________ Related posts: Can you use a cotton pad to exfoliate your skin?

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Title":["Use all the serums together or alternate them?"],"url":"https://www.vivawoman.net/2011/02/use-all-the-serums-together-or-alternate-them/","Text":["I think serums are important in our skin care routines and most of us use at least one serum, one time or another. However, I think some may use more than one serum so I’m curious as to how do you use more than one. I’ve always only used one serum but currently, I have two so how do I use them? Together or separately? Serum provides intensive care A good serum provides intensive care to treat problem or fragile areas and it aims to penetrate deep into the three layers of the skin to strengthen the cells as well as deliver active ingredients to our skin. The serums I use are typically for anti-aging purposes and aim to lighten up my pigmentation marks so I only use them in the night. Plus, I have combination skin and hence, I keep my daytime skin care routine simple and try not to overload with too much stuff considering I usually apply makeup over my skin. In the night, I will usually use two to three products after cleansing and toning and one of them is a serum. So is it good to apply two or three serums together? Take note of combined ingredients and their contrary properties I don’t have the “expert” answer but personally, I don’t use my serums consecutively. I prefer to alternate them and use one serum at a time. The reason being that I don’t wish to burden my skin with too much products and the other is because I noticed some similar ingredients in the two serums. If your serums serve different functions, then it is perhaps all right to apply two serums, one after another. However, it’s best to also take note that some ingredients when combined, may have contrary properties – for example, I’ve read that you can’t use copper peptide with vitamin C – so that’s another reason not to combine serums. But if you have to, then it’s best to stop at two serums at one go because using more than two all at once just don’t make sense to me. Tips for layering serums If you really need to layer your serum consecutively, it’s best to allow time for your first serum to be well absorbed into your skin. I suppose five minutes should do the trick but in some cases, depending on what you plan to slather on next, you may need to leave a 20 to 30 minute window. Additionally, you may like to know that it isn’t always necessary to use a face serum with a moisturizer. If you’re using a face serum that is formulated with some emollient properties, your serum may double up as a moisturizer. But if your skin is very dry and needs more hydration, then you will need to use a moisturizer on top of the face serum. How many serums do you ladies use? And if you use more than one, do you use them all at once or separately? © www.vivawoman.net copyright notice ☺ ______________________________________________________________ Related posts: Viva Challenge: Alternate breathing for beauty How to use face serum with moisturizer?

But other than for traveling purposes, do you decant your skin care products into smaller containers for daily usage? I do that a lot with the DIY ingredients because I usually like to keep them as fresh as possible so I usually decant my hydrosols or aloe vera for example, into smaller bottles while the big jars stay into the fridge. I also like to decant some of the essential oils I get from Garden of Wisdom into smaller bottles for convenience. Decanting from open jars As for my creams, I usually leave them in the original bottles unless they come in an open jar. Open jars aren’t the best of packaging when it comes to preserving the quality of a product and so to retain as much of the potency of the product as possible, I’ll decant some of the product into a smaller jar for daily usage. It’s a bit of a chore really and so I usually avoid purchasing products in open jars unless they are just masks that I use once or twice a week. Where to get small empty containers For decanting purposes, I sometimes purchase emtpy bottles. You can get them easily such as at Watsons, Sasa and Muji. I also like to recycle those small sample bottles and in the past, I’ll take home the toiletries from the hotels as those come in sizes just are great for decanting purposes. My current favorites are these empty bottles that I receive as samples from Marie Veronique Organics, which I find them rather useful to decant my oils. I also like those small containers used by Everyday Minerals for their samples as those are great for decanting creams or even lotions. So what about you?

Magic Elixir. Magic Skin Care. Magic Facial. And Magic What Nots. The word ‘magic’ seems quite common in the cosmetic industry. I’ve come across a couple of products using this word as a prefix and I wonder if these products generally do well. I mean, the word does conjur images of miraculous performance and instant results doesn’t it? Or is it abracadabra and then poof? Marketing gimmick? I agree that products using the word ‘magic’ as a prefix do draw some attention; at least I do pick up such products to check them out and some times even purchase them if the sucker in me is strong that moment. However, I always wonder why companies want to coin their products with the prefix ‘magic’. It’s too gimmicky to me and most of the time, such products actually raise both the skeptical antenna in me and my expectations of the product. Magic products I have tried Granted, there are products that work like magic but these are few and far between – I haven’t come across one that worked magic for me so far. For example, I was so excited when I first purchased the Egyptian Magic Cream but I have still have three quarters of the cream in the container unused. It didn’t do much for me, although it works magic for my son. So calling something ‘Magic XX’ is not a good marketing positioning in my opinion. In fact, people can become exceptionally critical of products coined as such and the strategy can backfire. Share your views! So what about you?

I can’t recall having nightmares about other aspects of my body; so I guess it has to do with the insecurities I have about my hair. How about you?

One week sounds rather short since most clinical trials cite at least 8 weeks of testing but I’ve also noticed that if the products actually does what it promises, you CAN see a difference in your skin a few days after using it. Results maybe more temporary for those promising anti-wrinkles I’ve noticed this to be true with products that promises brightening, evening out skin tone, depuffing and increasing hydration. As for those that promise to erase wrinkles and promote firmness, well, I say it depends. Sometimes the effects are almost immediate but they are most likely temporary and is gone as soon as you wash off the cream or serum from your face. Timeline I set for testing products I thought this is an interesting topic to discuss today. In fact, I was thinking a lot about this because as you know, one of the things I do is to test skin care products for this space. Typically, this is the kind of timeline I set for products: – Cleansers: two weeks – Oils, serums, lotions, creams: four weeks – Treatment products like masks: per usage – Eyecare: four to six weeks Checking against promises given And I always go back to check the promises that the product has given me. If it states that my skin would look radiant overnight, then that’s what I’ll look for. If it claims that my spots would lighten up in a week, then that’s what I’ll be checking. Except for eye care products, I actually expect to see some results after using a product for two weeks. And the reason why I give a longer testing period is to see how my skin would adjust for breakouts. For eye care, I tend to give a longer time because I have on some occasions, experienced improvements only after the 3rd or 4th week. Stuck it out due to initial investment But of course, the reality is that while we may give a shorter time frame to decide if a product is worth re-purchasing, we usually would HAVE to finish using the product because of the initial investment – unless of course it’s really dirt cheap. This is true for me – I forced myself to finish the bottle of GOW Bio-Active Neck Firming Serum even though it did absolutely nothing for me! I stuck it out because I didn’t want to throw it away and I couldn’t use it anywhere else. I did however, supplement it with other products. Your say So tell me ladies: how long do you expect to see results with the skin care products you purchase? And what’s the longest time you would give it? Would you stick to using the product till you’re completely done with the bottle or jar? © www.vivawoman.net copyright notice ☺ ______________________________________________________________ Related posts: Share: do you expect cosmetics to be freshly made?

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Title":["Help! Why is my skin so dry by evening?"],"url":"https://www.vivawoman.net/2011/03/help-why-is-my-skin-so-dry-by-evening/","Text":["A friend asked me why her skin feels a lot drier and tighter by evening and what she can do to overcome the problem – short of washing her face and re-moisturizing all over again. Coincidentally, this friend also has combination skin like me – dry cheeks with oilier t-zone. I have encountered this problem myself and these are some of the reasons I told her that could be causing the issue. 1. Moisture loss She could be suffering from TEWL. Trans-epidermal water loss (or TEWL) is defined as a measurement of the quantity of water that passes from inside a body through the epidermal layer to the surrounding atmosphere via diffusion and evaporation processes. If our system is deficient in water, the skin’s upper layers become dry and brittle. This is why we need moisturizer. But we need more than moisturizer; to keep our skin hydrated from within, we need to drink sufficient amount of water. Hence, my advice to her was to sip water throughout the day instead of waiting till she is thirsty to keep her skin better hydrated. 2. Caffeinated beverages Beverages with high caffeine content, such as coffee and tea, are considered diuretic and can cause more water to be lost. I am not sure about coffee but I am certain that drinking too much tea causes my skin to get drier in the course of the day, especially when I do not drink enough water. My friend loves to drink tea too and can drink three to four cups a day. Hence, I suggested to her to cut down on her consumption of tea and to drink more water instead. 3. Air temperature In Singapore, most of us work in air conditioned environment and it’s no surprise that the blasting cool, dry air is taking moisture away from our skin. This translate into dry skin, as moisture is sucked out of our skin. The same is true of those who use central heating. My friend works long hours in an air conditioned room and I suggested perhaps she can try to get a humidifier, which is said to be able to solve the problem as it adds moisture to the air. I’ve also heard that putting a glass of water or filling a room with plants will also help resolve the problem. 4. Glands of skin Additionally, I told her that it is widely known that our skin’s oil glands are also less active in cold weather. Plus, cheeks have very little sebaceous oil glands, and therefore are most susceptible to dryness. Hence, it’s no wonder that her cheek area can feel a lot tighter by the end of the day. To get around this, I told her to use a face mist once or twice in the day on that area and to remember to pat off the excess water and not leave the water to evaporate and cause more dryness. 5. Ingredients in moisturizer While applying moisturizer is important to keep our skin from drying out, what ingredients are contained within the moisturizer needs to be considered. I think many of us like the idea of applying an oil-free moisturizer but some of these contains mostly humectants, such as glycerin, aloe vera, hyauronic acid, lecithin, colloidal oatmeal, to name a few. While such a moisturizer will keep skin moist as long as there is sufficient moisture in the air, they may actually draw moisture from the skin in a dry environment. Hence, it’s best to find a moisturizer that contains a good balance of humectants, occlusives and emollients so that your moisturizer is able to retain or seal that moisture in so it is not then lost back to the surrounding air. Which means, it shouldn’t be a completely oil free formula especially if you find yourself with dry skin. Personally, I always apply moisturizer over a layer of facial oil and I find that works extremely well for me. However, my friend is less keen on applying a layer of oil and so she’s trying to look for an alternative moisturizer. So do you have the same issue as my friend? What do you do? What else should she be taking note of? © www.vivawoman.net copyright notice ☺ ______________________________________________________________ Related posts: DIY Beauty: Using Evening Primrose Oil For Your Acne Evening Primrose Oil for PMS and beauty?

In my experience, the brand matters a lot. Only Kordel’s work for me. No more cramps that cripple me for 24 hrs. Yay! ~ Zhenling I’ve been very skeptical about taking evening primrose oil because it didn’t work for me, even after increasing my intake to 2000mg per day. I wrote about this in my entry Evening Primrose Oil for PMS & Beauty last October. However, because of Zhenling’s comment, I went out to get a bottle of Kordel’s Evening Primrose Oil 1000mg + E200iu from Unity Pharmacy. Relying on milk for PMS relieve Before taking this supplement, I was relying mostly on milk to ease my PMS. Although it has been helping me but I could only drink half a glass about three times a week, probably because I’m Asian and it is said that most Asians lack the enzyme to digest milk once they become adults. PMS noticeably less severe So I stopped my milk intake when I started taking the Kordel’s Evening Primrose Oil because I wanted to ascertain that it is indeed working for me. And it did! The PMS didn’t ease completely but my backache was noticeably less severe and I wasn’t feeling particularly moody or emotional although my temper was still quite short. In fact, I would say it had the same positive effects as drinking milk. 100% pure and free of gluten I am not familiar with health supplements in general and I never realized that brands matter. I did notice however that Kordel’s Evening Primrose Oil is 100% pure and contains no added sugar, starch, yeast, gluten, salt, artificial coloring or preservative. Besides promoting premenstrual relaxation, it is also said to aid eczema, acne, dry skin and other sensitivity problems. Affordable and widely available Kordel’s is available at the pharmacies. I can’t remember the exact price but it is affordable – I paid about S$15+ for this bottle during a recent sale. The brand offers pure Evening Primrose Oil but I figured out I can do with the extra vitamin E too. Anyway, I’m going to continue on this supplement and with the help from my geranium essential oil , I hope I can chase the PMS blues away for good!

Although I have long heard that Evening Primrose Oil can help to ease premenstrual symptoms such as cramps and breast pains but for some reasons, I wasn’t keen to try them. Anyway, drinking milk to ease my PMS has been working and keeping me happy so I’ve left it at that. But I have been taking one of these 1000mg evening primrose rose capsules for awhile now because I wanted to find out if they’re any good for me. And what’s my verdict? Contains concentrated sources of Gamma Linolenic Acid First, for those who don’t know, evening primrose oil is extracted from the seeds of the evening primrose flower and the purified oil is then available in capsules as well as liquid form for consumption. From what I understand, evening primrose oil is one of the most concentrated sources of Gamma Linoleic Acid (GLA), which is an essential fatty acid of the omega 6 family with anti-inflammatory properties and plays an important role to maintain hormone balance and healthy skin. Provides various benefits for the skin One of the most proven benefits of evening primrose oil appears to be its ability to treat dry, scaly, or itchy skin conditions, such as rosacea, acne and atopic dermatitis. It also reportedly, has some modest benefits for eczema. In addition, I read that evening primrose oil may also help clear skin allergies, rashes and even prevent pores from becoming clogged. No complete easing of my PMS symtoms Personally, I haven’t found any PMS relieve from taking evening primrose oil. To test out if it will work for me, I deliberately stopped drinking milk for a week or so before my period and just relied on the intake of 1000mg of evening primrose oil per day. Well, not very wise because I suffered from my menstrual cramps and mood swings! It wasn’t very severe but the symptoms were apparent, compared to when I was drinking milk regularly. Helps women with low levels of GLA Based on some of the sources of information I’ve come across, there is little scientific evidence to support that evening primrose oil have clear benefits of relieving premenstrual syndromes ( source ). In addition, I learnt that many women who suffer from premenstrual syndrome have low levels of GLA, which is why evening primrose oil supplements may help to alleviate symptoms of their condition. Perhaps mine is not a case of low GLA? Or maybe the liquid form will work better for me? Topical application of evening primrose oil I also haven’t seen much of a difference to my skin after taking the evening primrose oil despite raves from my MIL. Perhaps I’ll have better luck applying the evening primrose oil topically on my skin because I’ve come across information that shows the oil of GLA can be effective when applied to skin irritations such as dermatitis as well as to help decrease the appearance of bruises on the skin. Well, we’ll see. If I can find a suitable DIY recipe to use them, I may try. © www.vivawoman.net copyright notice ☺ ______________________________________________________________ Related posts: DIY Beauty: Using Evening Primrose Oil For Your Acne Kordel’s Evening Primrose Oil for PMS relief Hormone imbalance from evening primrose oil?

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Title":["Do you do a skin patch test?"],"url":"http://www.vivawoman.net/2008/11/do-you-do-a-skin-patch-test/","Text":["How many of you perform a patch test on your skin whenever you’re using new skin care products or cosmetics? I have never but I’ve been increasingly worried about my readers getting allergies due to my recommendations. I don’t do patch tests because I am lazy but I know skin allergies are possible even with natural products or ingredients. Well, I’ve developed rashes from using mineral powder which is supposed to be all natural! So how do you conduct a skin patch test? Is it possible to do it at home, in DIY style? The answer is yes, although you need to be aware that this may not be as reliable as the actual patch testing done by a dermatologist. But it should suffice unless you have a weak immunity system or your skin is overly sensitive. DIY skin patch test First, choose an area you want to conduct the patch test and ensure it’s clean and free of lotion. Usually, the recommended spots to conduct a patch test is the inside of your wrist or inside of your elbow. Next, simply apply small doses of the product to the inside of your wrist or elbow, leave the product on for at least 24 hours. Do not wet the area or wash it off. Finally, check regularly to see if any irritation occurs such as itchy rashes, swelling, soreness, redness or burning sensation on the skin. If so, wash the area thoroughly with running water. Do not scrub! If by the end of the test period, there are no visible signs of allergic reactions, then the product is most probably safe to use on your skin. Patch test is important for those with sensitive skin I think skin patch test is important for those with sensitive skin, or are proned to skin allergies. Although I have not done a real patch test, but increasingly, I’m more careful about applying new stuff on my face by dabbing on small doses to a define area first. I know this is not the best course of action especially since I’m risking having allergic reactions on part of my face, but it sure beats having the whole face itchy or red. Patch test is necessary for hair dyes When it comes to hair dye however, it’s important to perform a patch test 48 hours prior to use. The same testing process applies and if there are no burning, itching or stinging sensations, then the dye should be safe to use. Come to think of it, nobody does a patch test for me when I color my hair at the hair salon. In fact, they don’t even ask me if I’m allergic to anything and I’ve always trusted my hair with them. But if they do, it’ll mean I need at least two days to have my hair colored! © www.vivawoman.net copyright notice ☺ ______________________________________________________________ Related posts: Share: do you avoid brands that test on animals?

The regular sunscreen I’m using, Keys Solar Rx SPF30+ , contains nano zinc oxide. I’ve been using it with a clear knowledge that there are some controversy regarding their safety level and despite having written that skincare containing such ingredients should be avoided. I know I am shooting myself in the foot but well, I can’t make up my mind especially since nothing conclusive has been reached about their safety. But at the least, I know what it contains because apparently, some sunscreens makers haven’t been as truthful. Is your sunscreen on the list? Nanoparticles in mineral-based sunscreens are more widespread than it appears to be according to this report sunscreen particles prove to be big issue . According to the report, Consumer Reports commissioned tests of five brands of sunscreen that company representatives stated did not contain nano-size particles of titanium dioxide or zinc oxide. Four of them, all labeled natural or organic, actually did contain nanoparticles and these are: – Aubrey Organics Natural Sun SPF 25 Green Tea Protective Sunscreen – Badger SPF 30 Sunscreen – Kiss My Face SPF 30+ Sun Screen with oat protein complex – Mexitan SPF 30 Sunscreen So if any of you are using these sunscreens and are not aware of the nano-ingredients, now you know. Actually I’m kind of surprised that Badger SPF30 Sunscreen is on the list because I remember the product does leave a bit of white residue upon application. If it contains nanoparticles of zinc oxide, then it should be entirely clear when rubbed on the skin. What’s wrong with nanoparticles in sunscreen? While the advantage is that they are great cosmetically, lab studies indicated that nano-ingredients in sunscreen create free radicals that damage the DNA of cells, and even low exposure to nanoparticles of titanium dioxide can damage the lungs of animals if inhaled. However, for them to pose direct health risks to humans, they have to penetrate the protective outer layers of dead skin and studies suggest they don’t reach live tissue under normal circumstances. But if you’re someone with sensitive skin or acne-proned skin, then you want to be careful because the same article quoted Kristen Kulinowski, director of the International Council on Nanotechnology as saying that “It’s not known whether skin damaged by acne, eczema, sunburn, or nicks from shaving is more vulnerable to penetration.” So to use sunscreens with nanoparticles or not, you have to decide for yourself. However, it isn’t fair if you do not even know what it really contains in the first place. © www.vivawoman.net copyright notice ☺ ______________________________________________________________ Related posts: Nanoparticles in Badger SPF30 Sunscreen New Mexoplex and nanoparticles in sunscreens Why I use a chemical sunscreen sometimes Avoid using avobenzone sunscreen and mineral makeup"],"Author":["Sesame"],"Date":["None"],"_template":"657e-4898-839c","_cached_page_id":"476ff9d59ffe2aa4cc99dbffb778f26ebff5483f"}

This is apparently confirmed by this Stability Study of Avobenzone with Inorganic Sunscreens by Uyen Nguyen and David Schlossman. Titanium dioxide and zinc oxide are preferable UVA / UVB sunscreens because of their efficiency and low irritation. In order to increase the protection in the UVA range, in many countries, avobenzone has been used in combination with titanium dioxide and / or zinc oxide. However, in the USA, combinations of avobenzone and physical sunscreens are not permitted. Avobenzone has been reported to be unstable when contained in formulations with uncoated physical sunscreens. Surface coating of the pigment has sometimes been shown to increase its stability. Based on this, it would mean that for those of us who are using mineral makeup, you need to be aware of the ingredients not only in your mineral makeup, but your sunblock as well. If you’re using mineral makeup without micronized ingredients (which is considered to be safer for our health), then ensure that you’re using a physical sunblock with titanium dioxide or zinc oxide without avobenzone. © www.vivawoman.net copyright notice ☺ ______________________________________________________________ Related posts: Are you blending away your mineral sunscreen?

However, this doesn’t mean that physical sunscreens are definitely more superior or that all chemical sunscreens are lousy. Chemical vs physical sunscreen By now, I believe most of you are already fairly familiar with the difference between chemical and physical sunscreens. For those who don’t, chemical sunscreens contain synthetic chemical substances to absorb UV radiation while physical sunscreens contain inert mineral particles specifically zinc oxide and/or titanium dioxide to reflect UV rays like a mirror. However, I’ve also mentioned that physical sunscreens may actually reflect and absorb UV rays in my entry mineral-based sunscreens are the best . European chemical sunscreens are superior I prefer physcial sunscreens because it is a personal choice and I like to believe that zinc oxide is the most superior sunscreen ingredient based on the FDA sunscreen monograph . I ignore most of the chemical sunscreens out there because I am not interested in using so many synthetic ingredients on my skin. HOWEVER, that does not mean that chemical sunscreens are inferior. On the contrary, I think highly of the European chemical sunscreen formulations containing Mexoryl XL and SX or Tinsorb and I sometimes use them. Whether or not these ingredients are as comparable or better than zinc oxide I cannot say but it should be noted that a sunscreen formulation ought to be viewed in totality rather than just based on one single ingredient. PPD rating measure protection against UVA rays The reason why I think highly of these European sunscreens is because many of them actually provide a PPD of at least 15, which blocks out about 95% of the UVA rays from your skin ( source ). Now, UVA rays are the ones responsible for most of your skin aging process and PPD is the rating used to determine a sunscreen’s UVA rays capabilities. It is unlike the SPF ratings which only measures protection against UVB rays. La Roche Posay Anthelios range with PPD28 Unfortunately, there are no PPD ratings done for US produced sunscreens which I’m using; not even those containing high amount of zinc oxide. Hence, I’m not entirely sure how well my skin is protected against the UVA rays under our hot sun. As for Japanese sunscreens, all I know is the PA+++ means a PPD of more than 8 but I don’t know exactly how much. Thus, when I head out to the beach or the pool under the hot sun, I actually use La Roche Rosay Anthelois Fluid Extreme or XL Lait Veloute with a PPD28 just to be sure. Yes I do, because I have a huge pigmentation problem. European sunscreen formulations with high PPD for pigmented skin Hence, if you have pigment problems or photosenstive conditions and you don’t mind using a chemical sunscreen, I would recommend you to go for European produced sunscreens because you can find out the PPD rating and how well protected are you against the UVA rays. La Roche Posay Anthelios XL is one you can try and I have a review here . The other one is La Roche Posay Uvidea XL with a PPD18 recommended by Pei Fang. © www.vivawoman.net copyright notice ☺ ______________________________________________________________ Related posts: Did my chemical sunscreen give me hyperpigmentation?

But I found a La Roche Posay pamphlet in one of the pockets of my bag and after taking a quick glance, realized that the company has introduced a new filter system called Mexoplex in their Anthelois range, which is a brand new synergistic combination of Mexoryl and Tinosorb together with Eldew, a photostablilizing oil. The new range has been introduced for awhile now but it completely miss my radar until now. Higher PPD rating According to the company, this makes Anthelios more effective in UVB/UVA protection with a PPD rating of 38 (an increase of 10points over the previous formula). On top of this, chemical filters in the formula are reduced by 15% making it very suitable even for the most sensitive skin. Extremely photostable I’m kinda excited by this new filtering system because I’ve highlighted both Mexoryl and Tinosorb as effective sunscreen ingredients in my post on the best and safest sunscreen ingredients . Eldew is something new to me though and I could not find too much information about this ingredient. Suitable for those with sun intolerance This range is non-perfumed and paraben free and is designed to protect skin against UV rays and meet the needs of patients prone to sun intolerance. Anyway, when I checked out the range at the counter, I could not see much highlight on Mexoplex on the actual products or maybe it was so inconspicuous, I just missed the info. Anyway, the range can be considered if you do not mind chemical sunscreens because of the high level of protection; it’s one of the brands I’ll purchase for my husband. Nanoparticles are not quite as harmful In another sunscreen related news, nano-sized particles in sunscreens have been in the news again. These particles are made of zinc oxide or titanium dioxide and hence, it applies to most of us who use mineral sunscreens. This time, an article published in the weekly newsmagazine of the American Chemical Society named Chemical & Engineering News (C&EN) has revealed the effects of nano-sized particles that have been used in sunscreen products and its benefits outweigh the “theoretical risks” caused by them. ( source ) Not so fast Yet, scientists continue to worry that these nanoparticles, which are measured in nanometers, might be dangerous to human health. They say these particles have fundamentally different physical, biological and chemical properties than their larger counterparts. ( source ) My stand I know some of you are keen to try sunscreens with nanoparticles because they basically offer better coverage without any traces of whitecast. Recently, I was also asked about my stand regarding this issue. Well, I’ve used sunscreens with nano-size particles but I no longer use them for the simple reason that there are plenty of alternatives. I mean if the ingredient is controversial and I have choices, why do I need to take chances? © www.vivawoman.net copyright notice ☺ ______________________________________________________________ Related posts: Nanoparticles in Badger SPF30 Sunscreen Does your sunscreen contain nanoparticles?

A spokesperson from Badger clarified on the article and because I know a number of you use this sunscreen, I thought it’s a good idea to highlight some parts of the comments in a separate post. This may ease some of your doubts about the sunscreen ingredients too. The Badger SPF 30 mentioned in the Consumer Reports article does contain some nanoparticles. The Consumer Reports article implied that the companies called were somehow trying to deceive their customers. I don’t think that was the case. A customer service representative at Badger did say, in answer to the question, “Does your SPF product contain nanoparticles?” “No. Our sunscreen uses ‘Micronized Zinc’ that stays on the surface of the skin and is not absorbed.” They should have answered, “Yes. Our sunscreen uses ‘Micronized Zinc’ that stays on the surface of the skin and is not absorbed.” – that was our mistake, and certainly not an attempt to deceive. “Micronized zinc” means zinc particles measured in microns (another unit of measurement). At the time of the call, our web site clearly described Badger’s use of nano-sized particles of zinc oxide in our sunscreen, and our reasons for doing so. Our customer service rep did their best to answer the question correctly. It was not “intent to deceive”. For the record, the US Government defines a nanoparticle as a solid particle between 1 and 100nm (nanometers, or billionths of a meter). Badger uses micronized zinc oxide with average and median particle sizes both greater than 100nm. These particles range in size from about 70nm to 300nm, so yes there are some nanoparticles among them. The presence of the larger particles is what accounts for the slightly whitening effect of our sunscreen (as you pointed out). Badger SPF 30 is currently rated by the Environmental Working Group as One of the Top 5 Safest Sunscreens in the World, out of the 951 national and international brands studied—including all of the top commercial brands. This study included both nanoparticle zinc and titanium based sunscreens, as well as chemical based sun-screening formulas. The Badger SPF products use nano-sized particles of zinc in their formulas because we feel they are the safest option available. We have no reason to hide this.

In addition, you may wish to note that the mineral-based sunscreens sold in powder or spray forms should be avoided as the potential for nanoparticle inhalation with powder or spray forms of mineral sunscreens is more of a concern. © www.vivawoman.net copyright notice ☺ ______________________________________________________________ Related posts: Does your sunscreen contain nanoparticles?

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Title":["Online platform for free beauty samples"],"url":"http://www.vivawoman.net/2008/11/online-platform-for-free-beauty-samples/","Text":["Many ladies at the beauty forums I frequent have been reviewing BB creams based on samples they’ve obtained and I was curious as to where they got their supplies. However, since I wasn’t ready to try the products now, I didn’t ask. But I found the answer when I received an email last week. Some of the free samples came from Fr3b , Singapore’s 1st online sampling platform. The name is a little strange but they’ve got an interesting concept. Companies provide the free samples and in turn, customers can order the free samples from Fr3b. You’ll need to register to become a member in order to place your order. In addition, members need to bear for postage fee starting from S$0.80 to a local Singapore address. What’s great is that the website also has a reviewing platform, so you can find out personal unbiased experiences from the other members about products you maybe interested in before trying them out. The BB cream samples from Roukiss, BRTC, Lioele and Lotree appear to be popular and you can also get hold of samples of products from Kawaii Tokyo, Cinelle, Cetaphil, L’oreal, Skinfood, Dermalogica and even natural and organic products from Yes To Carrots and Logana. The online platform is quite new but they already have quite a wide selection at the moment; from skincare, haircare to even personal care items and they’re still looking to expand the product base. Try before you buy. Great concept! Anyone has used their service already? * Update: I’ll be running a special for local readers next week with Fr3b.

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Title":["Best sunblock review: Keys Solar Rx"],"url":"http://www.vivawoman.net/2007/11/best-sunblock-review-keys-solar-rx/","Text":["Woot! I’ve finally got my hands on Keys Solar Rx SPF30+ , the safest and most effective broad spectrum UVA and UVB 100% vegan sunblock with the ability to protect my face from UV radiation while using no harmful man-made chemicals, fragrances or preservatives. And I honestly think that paying US$19.95 for the 100ml broad-spectrum sunscreen with 16 percent uncoated nano-zinc oxide is quite a steal. I mean that price for a sunblock featured on the Environmental Working Group Skin Deep Report as the safest, as well as rated the most effective non-waterproof sunblock for UVA and UVB in the Consumer Reports July issue? You may also like to know that zinc oxide is the best sunscreen ingredient according to this rating compiled by Environmental Protection Agency. Like what I wrote earlier, what’s great about Keys Solar Rx SPF 30+ Sunblock is that it is transparent on the skin when applied because of the cosmetically clear transparent nano-zinc oxide and hence, can be worn under moisturizer and makeup beautifully without leaving any white cast. But I realized that the all-natural formula which includes over 84% organic contents like avocado, black cumin, carrot seed oil, and shea butter is rather emollient. Thus, I only need a tiny bit of it or my face will feel too greasy and my makeup will become streaky. The sunblock also has a rather sharp scent which needs getting used to. Still, I’m happy with my synthetic-chemical-free Keys Solar Rx SPF30+ Sunblock because the low health hazard product with high UV protection gives me total peace of mind! Completely!

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Title":["Badger SPF30 Sunblock product review"],"url":"http://www.vivawoman.net/2007/11/badger-spf30-physical-sunblock/","Text":["Finally, after many months of waiting, Badger SPF30 Sunblock will be available during mid December here in Singapore. Surprising, I am not as keen on the product anymore probably because I now have Keys Solar Rx SPF30+ . But I will likely still purchase it for my kid since it looks like the 2007 formulation is now again rated the safest and most effective over at EWG Skin Deep Cosmetic Safety Database. I’ve actually tried a sampler of Badger SPF30 Sunblock and find it a tad too greasy for my face. And like Keys Solar Rx, it has a scent that needs getting used to, although admittedly not as strong as the former. In addition, the 20.5% micronized zinc oxide still leaves an unsightly white cast upon application even though the product states otherwise. I was also told the oil in the product will become saturated if the sunblock is left unused for too long. Still, I do like the fact that it is a 100% natural formulation with many organic ingredients especially 20.5% of zinc oxide that provides broad spectrum UVA and UVB protection. Just refer to the following rating compiled by Environmental Protection Agency. More important perhaps is that Badger SPF30 Sunblock is water resistant for up to 40 minutes so I can use it for outdoor activities as well. The price of this sunblock is around S$22 in Singapore, depending on where you get it. As the product is a hot item, you’ll need to pre-order by Nov 25.

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Title":["Badger Daily Aloe Vera SPF30 Zinc Oxide Sunscreen Lotion"],"url":"http://www.vivawoman.net/2013/07/badger-spf30-aloe-sunscreen-lotion-review/","Text":["The one skincare product that never fails to get my attention is sunscreen. So when I learned in January that Badger was introducing their Badger Aloe Vera SPF30 Zinc Oxide Sunscreen Lotion with a similar texture to their Badger Balm Damascus Rose Antioxidant Face Sunscreen SPF 16 , I was super excited! I went into a bit of a frenzy to hunt it down almost immediately. However, it took some time after the news broke out for the product to be ready but when it was finally available, the tubes got snapped up instantly. I had to wait like a month or so before getting my hands on it. The wait was a little agonizing but yippee, finally the sunscreen is mine! Non-greasy lotion formula that is easy to apply Okay, Badger already has some SPF30 sunscreens but if you know Badger, their sunscreens are greasy, thick and leaves a whitecast. The company started introducing a series of sunscreens with better texture and their SPF16 sunscreen was very popular. However, the SPF was really low and I would only recommend it to be used indoors. So it was a godsend when the company decided to introduce this easy-to-apply, non-greasy zinc oxide sunscreen lotion with SPF30 perfect for everyday use on your face and body. Finally, a non-gooey sunscreen that doesn’t make one look ghastly! Low zinc oxide at 12% I’ve always like Badger. I remember one of the retailers of the products here telling me that it is one of the better natural brands. And I think so. I like their choices of ingredients and I just feel safe using their products. However, I am a little iffy about this one because the zinc oxide is only 12%. Active Sunscreen Lotion Ingredient: Uncoated, Non-Nano Zinc Oxide 12% Inactive Sunscreen Lotion Ingredients: *Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe) Juice, *Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Oil, Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Oleosomes, *Sucrose Cocoate (from Coconut), Water, Microcrystalline Cellulose, Citric Acid (from Non-GMO Corn), Leuconostoc Ferment Filtrate (from Radish), *Glycerin (from Sustainable Palm), *Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe) Extract, Tocopherol (Sunflower Vitamin E), Gluconolactone (from Non-GMO Corn), Xanthan Gum, *Lecithin (from Soybean), Cellulose Gum. * = Certified Organic 100% Certified Natural by NPA 87% Certified Organic by NSF I know the formulation has been tested to provide SPF30 but I really wish the zinc oxide content to be higher at 16% or more. It’s just something I read about zinc oxide and my personal comfort level. However, reviews for this product have been good. I recall one reviewer stating that this sunscreen prevented sunburn for her so that must count for some good protection. Good for daily casual sun protection This Badger Aloe Vera SPF30 Zinc Oxide Sunscreen Lotion is really for daily use, suitable for casual sun protection. It is not water resistant and hence, not a heavy duty sunscreen for outdoor usage. In terms of texture, it is runnier than the Badger Balm Damascus Rose Antioxidant Face Sunscreen SPF 16 and much thinner and lighter than the Badger Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF34 . It is non-greasy and does not leave a whitecast upon application. In fact, it looks matt and a tad dry when applied on the skin. I am able to use this sunscreen on my face and neck without any issues. No oily residue and no unsightly whitecast! I also apply it on my arms. If you like the SPF16 version, you should like this too. Although this lotion is a breeze to apply, I do find the SPF16 version a bit faster to put on without leaving white streaks on my skin. With the Badger Aloe Vera SPF30 Zinc Oxide Sunscreen Lotion, I spend a wee bit more time blending in the lotion. Not drying and smells normal Having tried the three sunscreens, this is definitely my favorite on account of the higher SPF. Although the SPF16 is easy to wear, I don’t have peace of mind using it. Hence, I kept it to my neck and arms only. As for the SPF34 formula, that’s really something I wear when I head out for the sun and water play. While I’m slightly leery of the low zinc oxide content, I don’t mind using this on days when it’s cloudy or when I’m spending more time indoors. It doesn’t dry out my skin and doesn’t cause my skin to become tight or oily after a couple of hours. Oh, and it smells pretty normal to me too. Price and availability The 118ml tube cost just slightly over US$16 at iHerb (search under ‘Badger Sunscreen’). That price is a steal if you ask me! However, it’s always out of stock. Hence, I highly recommend you to sign up for the alert so as to be notified when the new stocks arrive. That way, you have a higher chance of getting the product. For those in Singapore, you’ll probably have to wait awhile before you can find this available here. If you want it sooner, grab it from iHerb! I’ll definitely be repurchasing this one. Somehow I think it’s way better than the DeVita Solar Body Block SPF30+ even though the latter comes with a higher zinc oxide content. The price is also slightly better. © www.vivawoman.net copyright notice ☺ ______________________________________________________________ Related posts: Is Zinc Oxide the best sunscreen ingredient?

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Title":["The medical & cosmetic benefits of tea tree oil"],"url":"http://www.vivawoman.net/2009/09/the-medical-cosmetic-benefits-of-tea-tree-oil/","Text":["Today, I want to rave about the wonders of tea tree essential oil and why this is an item I will always want to have at home. The reason why this oil is great is because of its benefical medical properties such as being antiseptic and antifungal, plus its beneficial cosmetic properties. I started out using the tea tree essential oil to treat my son’s cold and flu but found it really effective in helping with my skin ailment plus body odor. Tea tree oil is also known as melaleuca oil and is a clear to very pale golden hydrophobic essential oil with a camphoraceous scent. It is taken from the leaves of the Melaleuca Alternifolia which is native to the northeast coast of New South Wales, Australia. Tea tree oil in its pure form can cause irritation and hence, is best used diluted with another carrier oil or with water. Home remedy for cold and flu As mentioned, I used this on my son first. I tried out using this together with eucalyptus oil whenever he developed a stuffy nose, the early symptom of a common flu. What I did was to put about 6 – 8 drops of each essential oil into a tub of slightly hot water for him to soak and bathe in. By smelling the scent through the steam, his stuffy nose cleared up very quickly. If his symptoms were slightly more severe, I would proceed to rub the essential oil on his body by mixing 2 drops of each essential oil with 8 drops of carrier oil such as jojoba or even grapeseed oil on his chest before his bedtime. By morning, his stuffy nose or any early symptoms of a common flu would usually clear and go away. Because I ran out of eucalyptus oil subsequently, I later found out that tea tree oil by itself works as well! In fact, I also read that tea tree essential oil is great for those with sinus so I might later try the remedy on my husband who has that annoying problem. Home remedy for skin fungus Since I was always rubbing the oil on my son, I decided to rub the balance on my tummy. That area has developed some red patches since six years ago and nothing I use could eradicate them. I’m not sure what they are as the doctors could not diagnose them but I suspect they’re probably just some skin fungus. Amazingly, I noticed that all the red patches were gone in a matter of two weeks after I started using the tea tree oil mix! The oil was really godsend for me and I proceeded to use it on my back, which has the same red patches and they’ve almost cleared up after a week. Again, I never used the oil neat, but rather always dilute by adding 3 – 4 droplets with 8 – 10 drops of carrier oil. Home remedy for body odor This was a major surprise for me! Remember my post on my homemade deodorant with baking soda and tea tree essential oil? Well, I’ve been using that pretty consistently for a month or two and recently, I found that I don’t have to wear a deodorant daily! In fact, I can go without a deodorant for two days now, especially if I’m not perspiring a lot. Although I knew that tea tree essential oil can resolve unpleasant odor, I had no idea that it can help rid body odor! But, I want to qualify that I’ve also started taking zinc supplements so I’m not certain if that has also added to the positive effects as zinc can also be used to treat body odor. Well, in any case, I’m absolutely happy with my DIY deodorant and am working to make a stick version soon. Home remedy for acne Of course, tea tree essential oil is well known for treating moderate acne as it is reported that topical application of 5% tea tree oil has shown an effect comparable to 5% benzoyl peroxide, albeit with slower onset of action. Personally, I find it okay but not that miraculous in treating acne. Results are better for me when I mix it with emu oil though. Use with care So this is my positive experience using tea tree essential oil. I’ve been getting my supply from one of the mobile carts at the shopping malls that carry the range under the brand Bio Sense but I’m planning to get through sprees from LuckyVitamin.com as the range there is much cheaper. I really think this is a great oil for skin ailment but with most of the essential oil, do be very careful when you use tea tree oil, particularly if you’ve a medical condition or if you’re pregnant. In addition, concentration of the essential oil should be half or less of your carrier oil. For example, 3 drops of the essential oil with 6 drops of carrier oil. In fact, I would suggest you do a skin patch test if you’ve got sensitive skin. © www.vivawoman.net copyright notice ☺ ______________________________________________________________ Related posts: Thursday Plantation Tea Tree Body Wash & Soap Health and beauty benefits of essential oils Review: Thursday Plantation Tea Tree Blemish Gel Divine MedSpa:medical-grade aesthetic + spa"],"Author":["Sesame"],"Date":["None"],"_template":"657e-4898-839c","_cached_page_id":"0bf01cacb53918ffa48cd499c45591dfe0a6ec51"}

Well, not really. I still don’t fancy samples that much especially if they come in loose packets as I find them messy to use. I really prefer to test the products at the counter. But granted, some products can do with product samples – foundation is one example. However, unless I am offered, I usually don’t ask for them, especially if I haven’t purchased any items from the counter. Er…I actually feel a little awkward to ask for them even though I sometimes want to. So why do I feel this way since the samples are supposed to be given anyway? Well, one is because I haven’t really come across a SA who is generous enough to give me samples without asking me a string of questions. Second is, some of the brands had asked me for my particulars before releasing the samples to me. While the SAs haven’t been impolite, but I would say those experiences have added to my discomfort, and as such, I usually cannot bring myself to ask for samples even when I really want to. I guess I might be a bit shy… hurhur . So how about you? Do you have a problem opening your mouth to ask for samples? Would you boldly walk up to a counter for the sole purpose of asking for product samples?

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Title":["What do you do with cosmetic samples?"],"url":"http://www.vivawoman.net/2009/10/what-do-you-do-with-cosmetic-samples/","Text":["I was clearing my cosmetic storage the other day and found a stash of cosmetic samples that dated back to at least a year ago. I never tried them, even though I had initially wanted to. Actually, come to think of it, if the samples are not in containers or bottles, I’m less likely to try them out. I find it very messy to open up these packages because most of the time, I am unable to use them all in one go and leaving them in an open packet just does not seem hygenic to me. At the same time, the sample is so little, it does not justify my effort to find a small container to hold the remaining contents. So most of the time, whatever is left just ends up in the bin. I guess it is good to get samples to try the texture and check out the smell and if the lotion or cream will sit well on our skin. But that can also be achieved if there are product testers at the counter. I may find more use for sample packs of shampoo, but with other skin care products, I don’t really fancy the idea of samples. Afterall, how can I determine if they work well on my skin just after one or two trials? But having said that, I sometimes find them great to carry around for times when I need them for one-time usage like after swimming or maybe during a short trip. As for makeup, I hardly get samples but I recently received some 3D highlight lip glosses and lipsticks in a pretty pack. Again, I didn’t try them. I mean some of these sample packs really look very cute and lovely and sometimes, I just don’t have the heart to rip them apart. So what about you? Do you like to receive cosmetic samples?

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Title":["Seven natural mineral sunscreens compared"],"url":"http://www.vivawoman.net/2009/06/seven-natural-mineral-sunscreens-compared/","Text":["I’m re-posting this because I just realized that I missed out UV Natural Sunscreen earlier! So instead of six, it’s now seven of the mineral sunscreens tried and tested by Viva Woman. Most of these natural physical sunblockers, have at one point of time, been ranked as the top 10 sunscreens on the EWG list . However, the rankings at EWG keeps changing and as of now, they’re within the top 27 out of 129 recommended. 1. Marie Veronique Organics Creme de Soleil SPF 30+ I don’t know why this is being ranked as number 20 on the EWG list but my quest for the perfect mineral sunscreen has stopped since I started using this sunscreen. It’s got 20% non-micronizied zinc oxide and I love that all its other ingredients are natural and organic too. In terms of texture, this applies beautifully, hardly leaving much whitecast for my fair skin and I don’t have to worry about it causing my skin to become oilier either. My review is here and there’s also a tinted version for those who are worried about the slight whitecast. 2. Marie Veronique Organics Creme de Jour SPF 30 I use this interchangeably with Creme de Soleil now and it’s almost similar in ingredients and formulation, containing also 20% non-micronized zinc oxide. However Creme de Jour is a vegan formula and in terms of application, leaves more of a whitecast. Although this ranks better than Creme de Soleil at number 8 on the EWG list, I prefer the latter as stated in my review because it is less drying. 3. Keys Soap Solar Rx Sunblock SPF 30 This all-natural formula ranks as one of my favorites except for the fact that it contains 16% uncoated nano-zinc oxide. However, because of the nano particles, Keys Solar Rx is ideal for everyday use as a foundation for makeup or alone. The organic content of avocado, black cumin, carrot seed oil, and shea butter is rather emollient and so it is not possible to apply too much of this. It used to be the at the top of the EWG best sunscreen list but has since, moved to the 4th position. You can read my review here . 4. UV Natural Sunscreen SPF30+ I had high hopes for this sunscreen because the ingredients look really promising. But it turned out to be too heavy for my face and I broke out initally while using this although all were good again once I double cleansed my face properly. But funnily, the 24% zinc oxide content dried up my skin at the same time and so I had to ensure I had proper moisturizing prior to using this. I do like this sunscreen as it left me no whitecast due to the iron oxides. But because of the initial breakout, I developed a slight phobia using this on my face. In addition, the zinc oxide is micronized. So now this only goes on my hands. The only time I use it on my face now is when I go swimming because this formula is water resistant. This sunscreen has moved from no. 12 to 16 on the EWG safest sunscreen list and a more detailed review is available here . 5. Jason Sunbrellas Mineral Based Physical Sunblock SPF 30+ This is the first in the mineral series I have tried in 2007. This hypo-allergenic sunblock has no mineral oil, petrolatum, waxes, fragrance, alcohol or paraben and it contains 8% titanium dioxide and 2.5% zinc oxide. Application can be a problem as it leaves quite a heavy whitecast but good thing it isn’t greasy. My original review can be found here and this sunscreen is currently ranked 27 on EWG’s list. 6. Badger SPF30 Sunblock While I was testing the Jason sunscreen, I also tested a sample of Badger SPF30 Sunblock. At that time, it was the number 1 safest sunscreen rated by EWG but it has since moved down to the 7th position now. It containts 20.5% micronized zinc oxide which leaves an extreme whitecast when applied liberally. However, this sunblock is very greasy and is difficult to be used on the face; which is why I never bought the full-size. Read my review here . 7. Lavera Sunscreen Neutral SPF 40 This is my least favorite of the seven natural mineral sunscreens although it did work for me. Texture wise, it is quite similar to Badger SPF30 Sunblock but its key ingredient is just titanium dioxide. In addition, it is rich, greasy and leaves a whitecast when too much is applied. Read my detailed review here . Overall summary So my preference of the sunscreen is ranked in the order listed. My criteria for choosing is based on: – the amount of zinc oxide used and if it is micronized or otherwise; – the combination of other natural/organic ingredients included; and – the application of the sunscreen – little whitecast and not too oily. Marie-Veronique Creme de Soleil is my favorite and Lavera Suncreen Neutral is my least favorite of the seven tested. And like I mentioned before, I choose mineral or physical sunscreen because of my personal preference. It does not mean that chemical sunscreens are bad. On the contrary, I believe those European sunscreens made with Mexoryl or Tinsorb are fairly superior. But unfortunately, they tend to contain a host of other chemical ingredients which I’m not keen to use on my skin. © www.vivawoman.net copyright notice ☺ ______________________________________________________________ Related posts: Mineral-based sunscreens are the best Why mineral sunscreens and foundation may be better if you have melasma or hyperpigmentation More natural sunscreens with zinc oxide?

Alas. When I finally came down to ordering about a week later, the item was no longer available at iHerb. So in the end, I ordered the Badger Aloe Vera SPF16 Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Lotion instead. I figured that since I only wanted a sunscreen mainly for my neck and arms, I can do with a lower SPF for the time being. Similar texture as Damascus Rose SPF16 But it certainly looks like Badger has really made a great effort to improve their sunscreen formulations as this third product I’m trying under the brand’s daily sunscreen range is easy to apply and doesn’t leave an ugly whitecast or greasy appearance. You can say it’s nearly invisible. I had tried their Badger Balm Damascus Rose SPF16 Face Sunscreen and for a moment, I thought this is the same product as that because it feels and looks like it. The only difference is in the scent. Does not dry out skin and is non-gooey I wasn’t keen to use this for my face due to the lower SPF level as my preference is for a sunscreen with at least SPF30. However, I’ll concede that this applies very nicely without leaving any whitecast unless you’re of a darker skin tone. In fact, I’ll say this one is easier to apply and blend than the SPF30 version. When I tried it on my face, it works nicely with my makeup and does not dry out my skin nor is it gooey. I think those without pigmentation issues can go for this product. For me, my personal threshold for peace of mind is SPF30 and above. Full ingredient list Active Mineral Sunscreen Ingredient: Non-Nano, Uncoated Zinc Oxide 10.55% Other Sunscreen Lotion Ingredients: *Aloe Barbadensis (Organic Aloe) Extract, *Olea Europaea (Organic Extra Virgin Olive) Oil, *Sucrose Polysoyate (from Organic Soybean), Aqua (Purified Water), *Ethyl Palmate (from Organic Palm), *Sucrose Cocoate (from Organic Coconut), *Glycerin (from Organic Palm), *Citrus Medica Limonum (Organic Lemon) Extract, Chondrus Crispus (Carrageenan) Extract, Xanthan Gum, and *Hydrolyzed Soy Protein (from Organic Soybean). * = Certified Organic 100% Certified Natural by NPA 94% Certified Organic by NSF Overall summary Available at iHerb for US$14.39, the Badger Aloe Vera SPF16 Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Lotion is good enough for casual sun exposure and safe enough for those who spend most of their times indoor. It is definitely not a heavy duty sunscreen for prolonged outdoor activities. However, if you’re living in a tropical zone like like I am, I’ll still recommend you to go for the SPF30 version if you can get your hands on it. © www.vivawoman.net copyright notice ☺ ______________________________________________________________ Related posts: Badger Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 34 Review Badger Balm Antioxidant Face Sunscreen SPF16 Badger Daily Aloe Vera SPF30 Zinc Oxide Sunscreen Lotion Nanoparticles in Badger SPF30 Sunscreen"],"Author":["Sesame"],"Date":["None"],"_template":"657e-4898-839c","_cached_page_id":"391f4de8230d6ea60f78f617bb768bc249952002"}

And it’s none other than the Badger Balm Damascus Rose Antioxidant Face Sunscreen SPF 16. Some of you had recommended me to try this and so I ordered it from iHerb recently and have used it for about three weeks now. First of all, let me say that this is very different from the Badger Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF34 I’d reviewed awhile ago. Broad spectrum protection from UVA & UVB rays The Badger Balm Damascus Rose SPF16 Face Sunscreen is formulated to be a light, nearly invisible lotion ideal for everyday use, even under makeup. This is described as a nearly invisible sunscreen for the face that protects from both UVA and UVB rays while nourishing and soothing the skin. And like all of Badger’s sunscreens it contains only the purest, most natural ingredients-some of which are certified organic. Badger Balm Damascus Rose SPF16 ingredient list Active Sunscreen Ingredient: Non-Nano, Uncoated Zinc Oxide 10.55% Other Ingredients: *Aloe Barbadensis (Organic Aloe) Extract, *Olea Europaea (Organic Extra Virgin Olive) Oil, *Sucrose Polysoyate (from Organic Soybean), *Ethyl Palmate (from Organic Palm), Aqua (Purified Water), *Sucrose Cocoate (from Organic Coconut), *Glycerin (from Organic Palm), *Citrus Medica Limonum (Organic Lemon) Extract, Chondrus Crispus (Carrageenan) Extract, Xanthan Gum, *Lavandula Angustifolia (Organic Lavender) Oil, *Hydrolyzed Soy Protein (from Organic Soybean), *Rosa Canina (Organic Rosehip) CO2 Extract, *Hippophae Rhamnoides (Organic Seabuckthorn) CO2 Extract, *Rosa Damascena (Organic Rose Otto) Oil, *Anthemis Nobilis (Organic Roman Chamomile) Oil, and *Calendula Officinalis (Organic Calendula) CO2 Extract. * = Certified Organic Total Organic Content (excluding water): 75.31% ingredients Low zinc oxide content This product comes with a pretty clean ingredient list but I’m a little perturbed by the low percentage of zinc oxide used in the formulation. Hence, I’m unwilling to use this much on my face, especially not when the sun is so hot now. However, I bought it specially for my neck as most sunscreens that work well for my face don’t work well for my neck; they either turn out too greasy or too drying. Spreads evenly leaving no whitecast Although described as a lotion, the texture of the Badger Balm Damascus Rose SPF16 Face Sunscreen is creamy but not rich and spreads out very well on my skin. In fact, I could not see any traces of whitecast after application. It is the equivalent of a moisturizer and I guess this is why it’s quite a hit with many women. In addition, the soothing lavender and rose scent makes this product even more appealing. Price and availability Because sunscreens below SPF30 typically don’t protect my skin too well, I won’t use this much on my face unless I’m hybernating at home and not stepping out under the sun at all. But like I’d mentioned, I bought this to use on my neck and so far, it works well as it doesn’t leave any greasy or drying whitecast. If you’re good with sunscreens with SPF15, then you might want to give this a try when you get the chance. The 25.1ml bottle retails for US$16.20 at iHerb . © www.vivawoman.net copyright notice ☺ ______________________________________________________________ Related posts: Easy to apply Badger Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF16 Badger Daily Aloe Vera SPF30 Zinc Oxide Sunscreen Lotion Badger Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 34 Review Nanoparticles in Badger SPF30 Sunscreen"],"Author":["Sesame"],"Date":["None"],"_template":"657e-4898-839c","_cached_page_id":"2eedd894197e8b1edce543e46c793b6746ae185d"}
{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Title":["Facial exfoliation tips for sensitive skin"],"url":"http://www.vivawoman.net/2009/09/facial-exfoliation-tips-for-sensitive-skin/","Text":["I often get questions about exfoliation from those with sensitive skin. Because of their skin profile, they do not want to use mechancial exfoliation via a facial scrub or chemical exfoliation using AHAs, BHAS, retinoids, fruit enzymes, salicylic or glycolic acid as they find such products too harsh for their skin. So for these women, what are the options? Following are exfoliating tips for sensitive skin based on what I’ve read as well as from personal experience: Using a wash cloth Some skin care experts such as Leslie Baumann actually suggest that people with sensitive skin should not exfoliate and instead, use a soft wash cloth to slough away build-up and dead skin. This works well but just remember to keep your wash cloth clean and free from bacteria. Using a diluted facial scrub In her book, The Japanese Skincare Revolution, Japanese skin care guru Chizu Saeki recommended this technique of diluting the regular facial scrub with facial soap and a few drops of lukewarm water to whisk away dell skin cells on our face. By doing so, you will find that the scrub is less abrasive for your sensitive skin. Using gentle skin peeling products Products such as the Living Nature Cleansing Clay Peel or the Cure Natural Aqua Gel may be solutions for those who do not want to use any form of facial scrubs. In the former, all you need to do is to apply the Cleansing Clay Peel, wait a minute or two and then use your fingers to roll the slightly damp clay off. I’ve used the product as well as others similar to it and I always find my face glowing afterwards. As for the Cure Natural Aqua Gel which I’ve not tried, I understand that it is a safe and gentle exfoliation gel comprising 90% water and is very suitable for sensitive skin. How it works is that the product regularizes your skin turnover by gentle peeling, removing dead skin and necessary proteins, making your skin smoother, brighter and softer. Using homemade remedies I often recommend yogurt to those who want to exfoliate their face without using any facial scrubs because although it contains lactic acid which is an alpha-hydroxy acid, the ingredient is so mild that even sensitive skin can use it. You can also make a very simple scrub with oatmeal or strawberries that have a natural acid that helps to dissolve dead cells. Just mush it all up, rub it on then rinse off. © www.vivawoman.net copyright notice ☺ ______________________________________________________________ Related posts: Is facial exfoliation for all skin types?

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Title":["Badger Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 34 Review"],"url":"http://www.vivawoman.net/2012/09/badger-broad-spectrum-sunscreen-spf34-review/","Text":["I know a number of you are familiar with Badger sunscreens but I wonder how many of you are using this Badger Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF34. Well, the reason why I purchased this product was because it was on offer at US$4 at iHerb.com and it so happened that I wanted a water resistant mineral sunscreen for swimming and outdoor sports. However, given that I don’t really head outdoors that much, I started using this on my neck and arms daily. The Badger brand needs no introduction. It’s an established brand in the natural category and I do like a number of their products as they do not use synthetic chemicals, fragrances, parabens, or GMOs. More importantly, their products are rich in certified organic ingredients. Unfortunately, I can’t say that I like the Badger Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF34 that much. Ingredient list Active Sunscreen Ingredient: Non-Nano, Uncoated Zinc Oxide 18.75% Other Sunscreen Ingredients: *Olea Europaea (Organic Extra Virgin Olive) Oil, *Cera Alba (Organic Beeswax), *Butyrospermum Parkii (Organic Shea) Butter, *Theobroma Cacao (Organic Cocoa) Butter, *Simmondsia Chinensis (Organic Jojoba) Oil, Tocopherol (Sunflower Vitamin E), and CO2 Extract of *Hippophae Rhamnoides (Organic Seabuckthorn). * = Certified Organic. Total Organic Content: 81.05%. test Natural scents This Badger Sunscreen SPF34 uses 18.75% Zinc Oxide, which provides broad spectrum protection. It is free from essential oils and though it is indicated as unscented, it still retains the subtle natural scents of cocoa butter and beeswax. In addition, this sunscreen is now made from Vitamin E solely derived from sunflower, instead of mixed sources. Safe for children I like that this sunscreen is water resistant for at least 40 minutes, and safe for children of all ages. However, in terms of texture, this is really thick and rich. It’s a challenge to use this on my face but it’s okay for the neck and arms…for a couple of hours at least. Drying after a few hours Initially, I quite like using this as I found that if I don’t use too much, it can be blended quite well into my skin and the whitecast is not too obvious. However, after using this for about two weeks now, I realized that this sunscreen is drying. By the end of the day, I can see a thin powdery texture on my arms. So I cannot use this continuously but only on some days. And in that sense, this product is good for outdoor sports and not so much for daily usage. Price and availability The Badger Unscented Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF34 is retailing for US$14.40 at iHerb. I’ve stopped using this daily and since I don’t head out for sports that often, I’ll probably have my son to use this sunscreen when he goes swimming. © www.vivawoman.net copyright notice ☺ ______________________________________________________________ Related posts: Easy to apply Badger Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF16 Badger Balm Antioxidant Face Sunscreen SPF16 Badger Daily Aloe Vera SPF30 Zinc Oxide Sunscreen Lotion Badger SPF30 Sunblock product review"],"Author":["Sesame"],"Date":["None"],"_template":"657e-4898-839c","_cached_page_id":"b11cbddd4e088ffd85bf630e4a1024b37e9b0e31"}

Not so much to wear them but to ogle at them. In case you haven’t noticed, I’m also fond of featuring them! So this year I stumbled upon this Inner Circle CNY collection from Zalora with a modern twist. Very fashionable and may I add, real affordable. I’d to do a double take because I couldn’t believe the prices actually range from S$39.90 to S$69.90! And the quality doesn’t look so bad, going by the pictures alone. All in, there are over 100 cheongsams available at the online store. Many of them are the classic body hugging designs but I prefer the fit and flare designs. For one, they look a lot trendier and more important, they’ll work for women with bigger hips. There’s even a skater cheongsam so definitely no worries over getting stuck at the hips while trying to fit into a cheongsam! LOL. Instead of the usual auspicious red, orange or yellow, the Zalora CNY collection offers cheongsam in shades of blue, green and even black. That’s a clear departure from traditional expectations. I bet many younger ones wouldn’t mind wearing these any days other than the 15 days of Chinese New Year! But designs aside, I have to say not every lady can carry the cheongsam well. I could be wrong but I feel it takes a certain demeanour and also a fairer skin tone to wear the traditional dress. Like of all the models featured in the collection, this model featured in this post looks most elegant. Anyway, I don’t have the urge to order any of these pieces even though they’re very pretty. I might change my mind later perhaps. According to the website, it takes one to three days for delivery and free shipping is available for orders above S$40. I’m not sure if the delivery duration is guaranteed because the last time I ordered from Zalora at zalora.sg, it took me five days to receive the products. If any of you have better experience ordering from them or have ordered any of these pieces under the Inner Circle CNY collection, do leave us your comments. © www.vivawoman.net copyright notice ☺ ______________________________________________________________ Related posts: Cheongsam is no longer just a traditional long dress Are you into cheongsam during Chinese New Year?

Well, I don’t like them with the exception of one at a particular Japanese restaurant. It’s value-for-money with a good selection of food and I usually find myself heading for a second go. But today it’s not buffet I’m blogging about. Instead, I’m going to share with you five beauty products I gave a second go in recent months. Although they’ve not made it to my holy grail list of products yet but they’re worth highlighting simply because I don’t repurchase beauty products that easily given that I have a multitude of choices as a beauty blogger. The products listed here range from toothpaste, deodorant, cleanser, clay mask to foundation. You would find these products familiar because I’d reviewed them before. And except for one, the products were all purchased from iHerb . Living Nature Foundation In Pure Sand | S$33 from Naturisimo I first started using this BDIH-certified product at the end of December 2012 and ordered my second bottle a few months ago. You can read my full review over here . I wouldn’t say this is the best foundation I’ve tried but there are a few things I like about it. First, it’s of a natural brand formulated without harsh synthetic ingredients. Second, it works well for my skin, offering decent coverage. And third, my skin seems to have adjusted well to this foundation and I no longer feel the dryness I’d experienced initially. So this could have been my perfect foundation if only it offers better coverage for my dark circles and blemishes. MyChelle Honeydew Cleanser | US$14.40 from iHerb My first product from this natural brand is the MyChelle Dermaceuticals Creamy Pumpkin Cleanser (review here ) but I subsequently gave the Honeydew Cleanser a try and like that one better. Described as providing nutrient-rich moisture and hydration to the skin with each cleansing, MyChelle Dermaceuticals Honeydew Cleanser contains Melon Fruit for collagen support and Vitamin C, Chlorophyll (L) and Blue Green Algae. It’s not an exceptional cleanser but I like that it is gentle as it is formulated for sensitive skin and does a decent job cleansing my face in the morning without stripping it of its natural lipids. The price is also quite affordable for me to continue repurchasing if I want to. Now Solutions European Clay Power | US$4.57 from iHerb This is a really affordable and effective facial detox powder containing a natural mineral silicate that is designed for normal, combination and oily skin types in need of detoxification, as well as smaller pore size. I can’t attest to smaller pore size after using this but I can attest to a smooth, soft and well-cleansed face. Use it with water, use it with water and some drops of jojoba or olive oil, or use it with yogurt, this clay powder is truly versatile and perfect for that weekly at home skin care regime. For more details, read my review here . Oh, did I say the 170g tub last forever and it’s really cheap? Real Purity Deodorant Holistic Formula | US$10 from iHerb Okay, this one is a real keeper and it’s going to make it into my holy grail list! I’ve never been so impressed with a natural deodorant that is 100% effective. It even outperforms some of the ones in the non-natural category! I can totally take a challenge using this for outdoor activities too and won’t be embarrassed one bit. It works all day and even when the weather is hot and my pits are sweaty! My only gripe is that it leaves a slightly sticky residue which cannot be easily washed off. But given its outstanding performance, I can live with that. If you’re looking for a natural deodorant that works, you might want to consider this after reading my review here . Logona Organic Toothpaste | US$4.28 from iHerb This isn’t my favorite of all the SLS and fluoride-free natural toothpastes but I gave my second go at this particular one because it is something my son can use too. It’s a gentle foaming toothpaste that keeps the breath smelling fresh with its peppermint oil. Comes with a plain minty taste and because it contains calcium carbonate, so its chalk-like consistency also gives me better peace of mind in terms of cleansing prowess. For reference on the other SLS and fluoride-free toothpastes, check my entry here . Share your thoughts So there. Five beauty products I’d repurchased and may continue to repurchase. While it’s not a buffet spread, these are items I actually bothered to give a second go. It’s quite a feat, considering how I like to try different products and different brands. If you have tried any of them, do let me know your thoughts in the comments. © www.vivawoman.net copyright notice ☺ ______________________________________________________________ Related posts: 5 holy grail beauty products I buy again and again How to pose for a picture after having a filling buffet My hair conditioner gave me hairline pimples Can These Three Nuxe Products Make It To The Parisian Beauty Essential List?"],"Author":["Sesame"],"Date":["None"],"_template":"657e-4898-839c","_cached_page_id":"b3e12bf843caa0b127f5e21a53f579fd93818c22"}

It worked so nicely as a makeup base in place of a liquid foundation, giving me an almost flawless finishing after applying my powder! Going forward, I’m definitely going to order the tinted version of this sunscreen as it only cost a dollar more. Ingredients for Marie-Veronique Creme De Soleil Tinted Marie Veronique Creme De Soleil Tinted SPF 30+ smells and feels exactly like the untinted version . Besides the 20% non-micronized zinc oxide, it contains the same ingredients – green tea*, neroli hydrosol, non-micronized zinc oxide, oils of apricot kernel, calendula-infused jojoba*, sunflower & meadow foam seed, Vitamin E, MVO botanical anti-oxidant glycerite, aloe vera gel*, potassium sorbate, red palm oil*, mica, pearl powder, allantoin, xantham gum, oils of emu, sea buckthorn*, red raspberry seed & acai, non-GMO lecithin, honeysuckle, essential oils of carrot seed, cistus, lavender & helichrysum, iron oxides (for tint). *ORGANIC Iron oxide provides the tinted shade The iron oxide is the ingredient that provides the tint and I remember now that the UV Natural Sunscreen I used also has this ingredient listed last. The color was slightly beige and it sat rather nicely under my powder makeup too. Tinted sunscreen a good replacement for liquid foundation As you can see from the picture, the Marie-Veronique tinted sunscreen at the top was thinner and darker than my usual liquid foundation at the bottom but I assure you that it was perfect when worn together with my mineral foundation. So if you’re tired of layering your skin with a moisturizer, a sunscreen and a foundation, you might want to consider using a tinted sunscreen or perhaps a tinted moisturizer that contains SPF if you’re only getting casual sun exposure. Not advisable to mix your foundation and sunscreen Some ladies I know mix their foundation with their sunscreen to achieve this. However, this is not encouraged as when you mix anything with a sunscreen, you are likely changing the protective factor of the sunscreen. Perhaps mixing with a mineral foundation might work better since it isn’t liquid but personally, I’ll rather go with a readily formulated tinted sunscreen than try the DIY approach since we can’t be sure if the ingredients within the mineral foundation will be compatible with a sunscreen. © www.vivawoman.net copyright notice ☺ ______________________________________________________________ Related posts: Update on Marie Veronique sunscreens Seven natural mineral sunscreens compared 2009 best sunscreens & moisturizers with SPF Natural sunscreens spotted & an update on MVO"],"Author":["Sesame"],"Date":["None"],"_template":"657e-4898-839c","_cached_page_id":"4c8d0ebde9e3f375bb6174dccef3f680dddd8d65"}
{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Title":["Day moisturizers with no SPF: is there a point?"],"url":"http://www.vivawoman.net/2012/06/day-creams-with-no-spf-whats-the-point/","Text":["With so much focus on getting sun protection, I’m just not getting why we still see day creams or moisturizers in the market that contain no SPF. Seriously, what’s the point? I think it’s too much to get customers, especially those of us leaving in tropical climates to slather a moisturizer first, and then a sunscreen. If you ask me, I really think ALL day moisturizers should be made with some sun protection ingredients that offer at least SPF15, although I know many of you would prefer to see a higher number. Sunscreens can double up as moisturizers This is why I don’t use a moisturizer in the day. It just doesn’t fit into my daytime skin care routine as I much prefer to use a facial oil and then a moisturizing sunscreen. Although I’ve tried to use a moisturizer first and then a sunscreen, it’s not something I like to do. In fact, back in 2008, I wrote an article about sunscreens doubling up as moisturizers and I mentioned that I don’t use a day moisturizer but just rely on my sunscreen instead. It’s been four years since and I don’t see my skin condition aggravated because of this. Using a sunscreen and a moisturizer might clog pores As many of you know, most sunscreens can get somewhat heavy and so it makes little sense to slather on a moisturizer under it. Additionally, all sunscreens contain some amount of moisturizing ingredients and using two moisturizing products may clog the pores for some of us. I don’t mind a face serum with a thinner consistency though. Like I wrote before, unless your sunscreen does not contain sufficient moisturizing contents, or your skin is extremely dry or if you’re going through a winter spell, you might want to consider skipping the moisturizer especially if you feel your skin has been laden with too much stuff. Is there a point for day moisturizers with SPF? If you ask me, my answer is: they’re pretty much pointless for me. While I do have a few day moisturizers without SPF in my stash, they’re only there because they are products sent to me for review. If you read my reviews, you’ll notice that I always mention that I did not use the day moisturizer for very long. The reason they’re sent is because they’re part of a product range. And most of the time, I end up using such products on my neck instead. If the moisturizer contains some impressive ingredients, I might consider using it in the night if there isn’t a night moisturizer in the first place. Your preference? So how about you? I know some of you use a facial oil like me but some of you are using a moisturizer. Are you using one with SPF? Or are you using one without? If your day moisturizer is without SPF, I assume you slather your sunscreen over? © www.vivawoman.net copyright notice ☺ ______________________________________________________________ Related posts: 2009 best sunscreens & moisturizers with SPF Can sunscreens double up as moisturizers?

Sunscreens already contain moisturizing ingredients Moisturizers are great by itself to increase the skin’s water content, protect the skin and make the skin appear smoother. They are a beauty essential and they are mostly based on three types of ingredients: humectants, emollients, occlusive (very often emollients have occlusive properties as well). However, if we look at most of the sunscreen on the market now, they already contain some combination of humectants and emollients, as well as other ingredients. My Keys Soap Solar Rx Sunscreen for example, comes with 10% shea butter on top of a combination of avocado oil, carrot seed oil, black cumin oil and vegetable glycerin. Skip the moisturizer or opt for a humectant based lotion Hence, unless your sunscreen does not contain sufficient moisturizing contents, or your skin is extremely dry or if you’re going through a winter spell, then you might want to consider skipping the moisturizer especially if you feel your skin has been laden with too much stuff. Alternatively, you might want to use a lighter lotion based on humectant moisturizing ingredients. For reference purpose, you might want to refer to the following table to get a better understanding on the three types of moisturizing agents and find out what your sunscreen already contains. Types of moisturizing agents Texture & common ingredients Humectants Increase the water content by attracting natural moisture from the dermis into the epidermis. Don’t feel greasy on the skin. Best humectant active ingredients are glycerin, sorbitol, urea, lactic acid and hyaluronic acid and others. Emollients Create a protective barrier that prevents the moisture present in your skin from evaporating. Can clog pores & are generally not recommend for those who are prone to blackheads or breakouts. Ingredients commonly used as emollients are petrolatum, lanolin, butyl stearate, glycerin, lanolin, mineral oil, petrolatum. Occlusives Create an oily barrier on the surface of the skin which slows the natural evaporation of water from the surface of the skin. Heavy and greasy on the skin and can cause breakout to those who are acne-prone.Common occlusive ingredients include petrolatum, mineral oil, siloxanes (dimethicone, cyclomethicone), paraffin, beewax, and various vegetable and animal fats like lanolins, cocoa butter, jojoba, olive and almond oils. Moisturizer with sunscreen? Moisturizer with sunscreen? And what about moisturizers that contain sunscreen? Some people might think this is a better option. Well, I’m not too keen on the idea because most of the time, the sunscreen protection factor is low. Plus the sunscreen active ingredients may not be sufficient. Hence, my preference is to go for a good sunscreen that also has moisturizing capabilities. Sunscreen first or moisturizer first Oh, I forgot to add that by using a sunscreen that doubles up as a moisturizer, you also take the headache out of when to apply sunscreen in the order of our skincare regime. As mentioned in my earlier entry sunscreen before or after moisturizer , if you’re using a chemical sunscreen which absorbs UV rays and neutralize them in the skin tissues, then you have to apply it clean, bare skin first because in order to be effective, it must interact with our skin cells. © www.vivawoman.net copyright notice ☺ ______________________________________________________________ Related posts: 2009 best sunscreens & moisturizers with SPF Day moisturizers with no SPF: is there a point?

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Title":["DIY Beauty: grounded rice body scrub"],"url":"http://www.vivawoman.net/2009/07/diy-beauty-grounded-rice-body-scrub/","Text":["I sometimes like to grind my rice grains to make porridge. So while doing that the other day, I decided to grind a bit more to test how the grounded rice would work as a body scrub. And because they weren’t that fine, I didn’t want to use it on my face. Great for exfoliating The color of the grounded rice is such because it was a mixture of white and brown rice grains. Except for the grinding, this is easy to make. All I did was to add water to the grounded rice grain to make an exfoliating scrub. I didn’t want anything fanciful but of course if you like, you can add some oats, almond or olive oils and even essential oils for the moisturizing and aroma factors. Again, it’s up to your imagination and creativity! Consistency is better than epsom salt recipe Compared to the homemade epsom bath salt scrub , I actually like the firm consistency of this better because the grounded rice blended quite well with water and isn’t as loose and hence, doesn’t drop off that easily when I rub them on my skin. In addition, there are no worries about smarting in case of open wounds. And it’s really up to you to decide how fine or how coarse the rice grains should be grounded. Add a handful to your shower gel In terms of benefits, rice has been said to have whitening properties but I can’t vouch for that, at least not in the short term. However, I’ll say that this works as a nice homemade body scrub. Very simple. Nothing fanciful. You can also mix some of your favorite shower gel with a handful of grounded rice to create the ultimate exfoliating scrub. If you have loved using epsom salt as a body scrub, you would love this too! © www.vivawoman.net copyright notice ☺ ______________________________________________________________ Related posts: DIY Beauty: homemade salt bath scrub DIY Beauty: homemade foot soak & scrub DIY Beauty: Himalaya rock salt scrub gift idea ThinkHappy Organic Surge Body Scrub"],"Author":["Sesame"],"Date":["None"],"_template":"657e-4898-839c","_cached_page_id":"c3080cecc1cc7c97a0740c449c836f84d8dd56be"}
{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Title":["Can These Three Nuxe Products Make It To The Parisian Beauty Essential List?"],"url":"http://www.vivawoman.net/2016/08/can-these-three-nuxe-products-make-it-to-the-parisian-beauty-essential-list/","Text":["Bonjour! Today, we’re taking a peek at Nuxe, a French brand that’s been helping Parisian women maintain beautiful skin the natural way. Familiar with Nuxe? I’m not surprised. After all, the brand has been around since early 1990s and can be readily found at French pharmacies and Watsons closer to home. But for those who don’t know, Nuxe is a popular pharmacy beauty brand from France with a wide range of plant-based natural skin and hair care products developed by their very own R&D team. All their products are formulated with natural ingredients without parabens, mineral oil and ingredients containing animal extracts. The amount of natural ingredients used is indicated on each product. The three products I’m about to review contain over 90 percent natural ingredients. Nuxe Comforting Cleansing Milk With Rose Petals Nuxe has a score of cleansers to meet very cleansing need. I picked up this Comforting Cleansing Milk With Rose Petal that is supposed to cleanse and remove makeup for both face and eyes. This product is said to be formulated with at least 94.1 percent natural origin ingredients and no parabens. It also contains hypoallergenic fragrance specifically developed for sensitive skin. Here’s the full ingredient list: Aqua/water, rosa damascena flower water, macadamia integrifolia seed oil, cocos nucifera (coconut) oil, c14-22 alcohols, parfum/fragrance, glycerin, hydrogenated coconut oil, propanediol, benzyl alcohol, c12-20 alkyl glucoside, capryloyl glycine, tocopheryl acetate, tocopherol, sodium hydroxide, carbomer, citric acid, sodium cottonseedamphoacetate, acrylates/c10-30 alkyl acrylate crosspolymer, helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, allantoin, tetrasodium edta, dehydroacetic acid [n2306/a]. When my skin made contact with this cleanser, I immediately regretted… Why didn’t I meet Nuxe Comforting Cleansing Milk earlier? Why did I have to take so long to discover such an amazing cleanser when it was right under my nose all this while? Truly, this product should have been discovered earlier… Cleanses well and leaves no icky residue Nuxe Comforting Cleansing Milk feels creamy but is not too thick. Just two pumps is sufficient for my face. It doesn’t cleanse my eye makeup as well though unless with the aid of a cotton wool. But I’m not complaining because it does a fine job on my face without need for a wash cloth or sponge. I can use this product either as a first cleanser, a second cleanser or as both my first and second cleanser in my double cleansing routine. It cleanses my face well, even on first wash. No greasy or icky residue, no tightness and no dryness even if I use it a second time. I love that the idea of rose petals in the formulation-the scent backs that but it smells more like a sweet perfume to my untrained nose. Kind of reminds me of some body powder that I’d used in the past. This cleanser is not the best cream/milk cleanser I’ve used but it is definitely on the top three list on the scale of effectiveness. I’ll definitely repurchase this again. Some of you will probably feel uncomfortable with the price of this cleanser. A 200ml bottle cost S$40. But if you like gentle cleansers that are milk or cream based, try getting this the next time you chance upon a sale at Watsons. I believe you will like it too. Nuxe Micellar Cleansing Water With Rose Petals This product hails from the country where micellar cleansing water first began. It’s said to be a 3-in-1 product that cleanses, purifies and softens. Nuxe Micellar Cleasning Water contains at least 97.4 % of natural origin ingredients and no parabens. Again, it contains hypoallergenic fragrance specifically developed for sensitive skin. Here’s the full ingredient list: Aqua/water, rosa damascena flower water, glycerin, parfum/fragrance, benzyl alcohol, capryloyl glycine, citric acid, coco-glucoside, sodium hydroxide, allantoin, caprylyl/capryl glucoside, tetrasodium edta, dehydroacetic acid, sodium hyaluronate, linalool [n2305/a]. I haven’t used that many micellar water so I’m not certain if they differ all that much. Nuxe Micellar Cleansing Water feels and smells like a micellar cleansing water I’ve used before but with a tad less suds. I use it on some days as a second cleanse or first thing in the morning. It lives up to its promise and I like that it leaves my skin clear and soft. Price wise, it cost the same as the milk cleanser. A 200ml bottle costs S$40 too. Like I mentioned, you might want to consider buying this during a promo. For those who have not tried using micellar water, you can read my post on the different ways to use micellar cleansers . If you live in a country where water is hard, this no-rinse formula will be good for your skin. I recommended it to a colleague and she loves it because it is so convenient. Nuxe Gentle Toning Lotion With Rose Petals This toning lotion for face and eyes cleanses and removes make-up, protecting skin from becoming dry. It contains at least 97.4 % of natural origin ingredients based on the following ingredient list: Aqua/water, rosa damascena flower water, hamamelis virginiana (witch hazel) water, glycerin, parfum/fragrance, benzyl alcohol, capryloyl glycine, citric acid, sodium hydroxide, allantoin, coco-glucoside, tetrasodium edta, dehydroacetic acid, caprylyl/capryl glucoside, sodium hyaluronate, linalool [n2301/c]. I find myself reaching out for this toner after cleansing my face. It helps to hydrate my skin at the same time balances the pH level of my skin. But even though I like it, I’m not keen on paying S$40 for a 200ml bottle of toner. So I’ll only recommend this when during a special promotion. Likely to repurchase I don’t understand why the products are named “with rose petals” when I don’t see a shred of petal in any of them. I’m also not crazy about the artificial rose scent. But overall, I like these Nuxe products especially the Comforting Cleansing Milk and I think they can make it to the Parisian beauty essential list. Heck, I even like the feminine vibes through their pink packaging. While I don’t quite mind paying S$40 for a 200ml bottle of cleansing milk, I’ll probably prefer to wait for a sale to repurchase the other two. If you’re keen to try out these, I would suggest waiting out for a sale to take advantage of lower prices. If you’ve tried something from Nuxe that you like, do share your comments with us.

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Title":["My hair conditioner gave me hairline pimples"],"url":"http://www.vivawoman.net/2011/06/comedogenic-emulsifiers-cause-hairline-pimples/","Text":["Over the past two months, I noticed that I’ve had some bumps on my forehead, very near my hairline. I was told that any pimple or acne on the forehead is usually caused by insufficient sleep or stress and so I left them, thinking that they will subside. They didn’t and I started suspecting my hair products to be the cause because the bumps were not really acne but more like pimples caused by clogged pores. Thank goodness there were just a few. Even a pea size amount can clog pores I was using BOD Premium Blend Shampoo and I thought it might be that because the shampoo felt very moisturizing. So I stopped using the product and switched to A’kin Mandarin Shampoo and the problem appeared to have stopped. So naturally I thought it was the BOD shampoo and I was rather sore about it since it cost me S$20 and I didn’t feel like throwing it away nor did I feel it right to give to someone since it didn’t work for me. The thing was, it was never the shampoo but rather the conditioner I was using. I didn’t suspect a thing about the conditioner because well, I was using just a pea size amount! Ingredients of conditioner Although the BOD Premium Blend Shampoo was moisturizing, I also used The Body Shop Rainforest Radiance Conditioner for colored hair because I wanted some protection for my colored hair. This is what it contains: Water (Solvent/Diluent), Cetearyl Alcohol (Emulsifier), Glyceryl Stearate (Emulsifier), Distearoylethyl Hydroxyethylmonium Methosulfate (Antistatic Agent), Glycine Soja Oil (Emollient/Skin Conditioner), Polyglyceryl-4 Caprate (Skin-Conditioning Agent), Glycerin (Humectant), Parfum (Fragrance), Sodium Benzoate (Preservative), Sucrose Laurate (Skin-Conditioning Agent), Hydroxypropyl Guar (Emulsion stabilizer, Viscocity increasing agent), Linum Usitatissimum Seed Oil (Fragrance Ingredient), Salicylic Acid (Preservative/Hair Conditioner), Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice (Skin Conditioning Agent), Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate (Sunscreen), Pentaclethra Macroloba Seed Oil (Skin-Conditioning Agent), Citric Acid (pH Adjuster), Vaccinium Myrtillus Fruit Extract (Skin-Conditioning Agent), Tocopherol (Antioxidant). I didn’t really pay much attention to the ingredients because if you know The Body Shop’s products, you need to make an effort to peel off the label to read the ingredient list and I was too lazy to do that! I was happy that it didn’t contain silicones, sulphates, parabens or colorants. Plus, like I said, I wasn’t using too much of it each time. And because I stopped using it along with the BOD shampoo, it was never a key suspect for me. I only realized it to be a culprit this week after I decided to use it again, but this time with the A’kin Mandarin Shampoo. I had another clogged pore, which emerged to become a full blown pimple on the same hairline spot. Too many emulsifying and skin conditioning ingredients It was then that I took a good look at the ingredients and realized that this conditioner has too many emulsifying and skin conditioning agents. The second ingredient and third ingredient – Cetearyl Alcohol and Glyceryl Stearate – are prime suspects because one is highly comedogenic and the other is considered mildly so. Much like silicones, such emulsifiers creates a film that protects moisture from escaping and this same film can also lead to clogged pores. Resource to analyze ingredients So lesson learnt for me. A product with too much emulsifiers can be as bad as one with too much silicones. I’ll remember to check the ingredient list of new shampoos or conditioners that I test in future. Anyway, here’s an interesting website that allows you to analyze the ingredients and tells you which ones are comedogenic and might cause irritations.

That’s an increase of 6kg in a space of a few months! Oh grief! I no longer can slip on my jeans but instead, I have to literally jump into them. And the belt, which I used to put on to tighten the pair of jeans to my waist, is now history. *sigh* I’ve been telling myself that I need to shave some of those kilos off my butt and I need to do so fast but all the time, not controlling what I put in my mouth! So here’s a random post to show you what I’ve been feeding on. We eat out quite a bit but I’ll say we’re not exactly that adventurous as we usually head back to the same places we like. Like Kuishin Bo at Suntec City for the Japanese buffet. How many of you know that buffets are bad news for weight management? Totally awful! You can eat anything and everything! Like these lovely Japanese desserts. I had this whole plate ALL to myself after eating plates of sushi, sashimi and other stuff. When my hubby saw this, he rolled his eyes incredulously and pretended he didn’t see them. I tried to salvage by having more grapefruits (well, they’re known to help one lose some weight) and pickles. Okay, I don’t think pickles does much to help with the weight issue but I just love them. They’re so crunchy and delicious. Something else I found interesting at the restaurant is this Japanese teapot soup. Yeah, soup not tea but it does feel like you’re drinking some sort of a thick flavored tea. Nice to try if you haven’t. I’m so full that I’m skipping dinner altogether to make myself feel better. HA. But it doesn’t help that I was walking around with a loaded tummy. I kid you not that I had to breathe in real hard, tuck in my tummy and force a smile when I posed for this picture. I think I need to wear a corset! LOL. Outfit of the day: Top with eagle print from ASOS . Juicy Couture Freya Tote from Shopbop . Jeans from Guess .

However, it’s a choice I weigh very carefully because I do value what I use on myself. Naturally, this also means that products that I repurchase over and over again must really mean something for me. So are there a lot of products that I repurchase again and again? Well, there are actually just a handful. And what are they? Come take a look! These are my absolute favorites. Some of them are old loves while some are relatively newer. Nonetheless, they are products I would not hesitate to fork out money for. In fact, they are also products I would highly recommend. Marie Veronique Organics Moisturizing Face Screen, US$40 from MVO Right at the top of the list is my favorite sunscreen from Marie Veronique Organics. I’ve been using this product since 2009 when it was still under the old name of “Creme de Soleil”. It is my HG daily sunscreen and I can no longer remember how many bottles I’ve used thus far. I can just see myself continuing with this because I can’t find any other products that can replace this. Available at Marie Veronique Organics and it’s been renamed to MVO Everyday Coverage. You can read my older reviews here and here . Giovanni Golden Wheat Deep Cleanse Shampoo, US$5.57 from iHerb I like this shampoo so much that I’m probably in my fifth bottle now and I’m still ordering more from iHerb. It’s so cheap and works great for my hair type. I don’t even need a conditioner with this one! Although I do like to try new shampoos but I’m so hesitant that they’re just going to ruin my shampooing experience. But for now, this is my HG! Available at iHerb.com and you can read my review of the product here . Surya Brasil Henna Cream, US$9.22 from iHerb I’m surprised this one has ended up in my favorite beauty buys. In fact, I’ve used like four bottles now! Well, it works well for me and I end up coloring my hair once a month now. I can see my hair looks healthy, unlike those who have their hair colored using the conventional dyes. Available at iHerb.com and my review of the product is here . AFC Japan Collagen Beauty Supplement, S$43.30 I sometimes try new beauty supplements but this is the one I keep going back to because it works for me. I have lost count but must have taken about seven packs or more now? I usually stock up when it’s on sale. Available at Guardian, Unity or Watsons and you can read my review of the product here . LA Splash Mineral Foundation Powder, S$34.90 I’ve strayed quite a bit with foundation powder but after trying out a couple of mineral foundation, I have to say I like this one. I have been mixing around with the colors though by adding in purple and green bases. It works well with my skin type and I can see myself using this for longer. But then again, I definitely wouldn’t discount trying new foundations. Available at Guardian Pharmacy and I wrote a review of the product here . More HG products I have a couple more favorites but I haven’t purchased them more than once or twice and hence, I’m not highlighting them here. I certainly hope to be able to find more awesome products going forward. For a start, I’ll like to find a HG deodorant. Perhaps a great eye cream and maybe some good makeup products too.

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Title":["Battle of 4 SLS and fluoride-free natural toothpastes"],"url":"http://www.vivawoman.net/2012/03/battle-of-the-sls-fluoride-free-natural-toothpaste/","Text":["Appalled by the tubes of toothpastes lying around these days, my hubby asked me “why in the world do you need to use so many of them?” Well, the answer is I don’t need to but I just want to. Heh. Yes, I’ve gone quite mad over toothpastes all of a sudden after I wrote about herbal toothpastes last month and decided to take on the recommendations given by some of you seriously. So I went out to buy myself not one, but four natural toothpastes which are all SLS and fluoride-free. Fluoride-free to prevent enamel fluorosis in kids Actually the real reason why I decided to switch to using natural toothpaste is for the sake of my son. I figured out that while fluoride wasn’t doing any harm for my husband and I (at least not that I know of), I’m not too sure of my son because I noticed that he’s having this discoloration that does not seem to be due to improper brushing. I wasn’t sure if that’s a case of enamel fluorosis due to too much fluoride but I wasn’t quite prepared to take the risk with him. Review of 4 natural, SLS & fluoride-free toothpastes So after going through some of your recommendations, I went on a SLS & fluoride-free toothpastes hunt. In the end, I bought four – one of them from Bud Cosmetics, and the rest from iherb.com – all because I wasn’t sure what’s best and I figured it’s no harm just trying a few since changing toothpaste every day isn’t going to hurt my teeth anyhow. So here’s my quick review of them, after trying them out for about two weeks now and I’ve listed them by preference – from the least to the most favorite. Weleda, Plant Gel Toothpaste, 3.3oz US$5.38 from iherb.com Ingredients: Glycerin, water (aqua), hydrated silica, chamomilla recutita (matricaria) flower extract, krameria triandra (ratanhia) root extract, commiphora myrrha (myrrh) extract, mentha viridis (spearmint) leaf oil, mentha piperita (peppermint) oil, foeniculum vulgare (fennel) oil, algin, alcohol, esculin, limonene*. *From Natural Essential Oils This plant gel toothpaste is said to work because of the natural silica. According to description, the unique combination of plant extracts helps balance the normal functions of the mouth, maintaining the natural flora. It’s gel-like in texture and comes in a dark pink shade; my mouth does feel refreshed using this and in terms of taste, this is the best of the lot with a mix of slightly sweet but minty freshness. Well, I’m not liking this one very much because it hardly foams and I find myself having to squeeze a lot of the toothpaste just to be sure. In addition, this one contains alcohol although the amount shouldn’t be high since it’s listed almost at the bottom. XyliWhite Toothpaste Gel, 6.4oz US$3.81 from iherb.com Functional Ingredients: Xylitol (25%), papain (whitening) Ingredients: Water, xylitol (25%), hydrated silica, glycerin, sorbitol, sodium bicarbonate, sodium carbonate, sodium coco-sulfate, carrageenan (chondrus crispus), tea tree (melaleuca alternifolia) leaf oil, peppermint (mentha piperita) oil, spearmint (mentha viridis) oil, papain, potassium sorbate. Gluten free. I was attracted to this one because of the number of positive reviews at iherb.com as many customers found this good for tooth whitening. This is a product from Now Foods and uses all-natural Xylitol as its main ingredient, which is not available in the other toothpastes in this review. I’ve not used this long enough to tell if there’s any whitening but it does keep my mouth fresh because of relevant ingredients. This toothpaste gel comes with a plain minty taste and while it foams better than the Weleda Plant Gel Toothpaste, I wish it can do better. Logona Daily Care Toothpaste, 2.5oz S$9 from Bud Cosmetics Ingredients: Aqua (Water), Calcium Carbonate, Glycerin, Silica, Sodium Lauryl Sulfoacetate, Maris Sal (Sea Salt), Xylitol, Chondrus Crispus (Carrageenan), Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract*, Xanthan Gum, Algin, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Oil*, Aroma (Flavor), Limonene I find this most suitable for my son because it’s a gentle foaming toothpaste that keeps the breath smelling fresh. Like the XyliWhite Toothpaste Gel, this comes with a plain minty taste and because it contains calcium carbonate, so its chalk-like consistency also gives me better peace of mind in terms of cleansing prowess. Jason Natural, Powersmile, 6oz US$4.71 from iherb.com Calcium carbonate, aqua (water), glycerin, sodium cocoyl glutamate, mentha piperita (peppermint) oil, carrageenan, aloe barbadensis leaf gel*, bambusa arundinacea stem powder, carum petroselinum (parsley) extract, citrus grandis (grapefruit) seed extract, perilla ocymoides seed extract, stevia rebaudiana extract, silica, sodium bicarbonate. *Certified Organic Ingredient This is my favorite of the lot. In fact, I’m pretty impressed as I find its performance above the normal Colgate toothpaste I was using and this can be attributed to the exclusive blend of natural polishers and stain-fighting botanicals, including bamboo powder, calcium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate and silica. And because it’s quite potent, I don’t need to use that much of the paste compared to the others or I’ll get a rather bitter minty aftertaste. I was concerned that my son might find this too strong for his taste but turned out, he is okay using this. Overall summary It’s a bit hard to tell if these toothpastes are providing effective whitening properties but at the least, I do not see any discoloration. My boy’s teeth seem to be looking better but it might also have to do with his recent dental polishing. But of the lot, I will most likely continue to use the Jason Natural, Powersmile. It’s the best of the four I’ve tried and going by the usage and quantity, the price is reasonable if you were to get it direct from iherb.com (it’s expensive if you purchase it from the retailers in Singapore). I reckon that between my son and me, this tube can last us for around two months or so? © www.vivawoman.net copyright notice ☺ ______________________________________________________________ Related posts: Jason Natural Powersmile fluoride-free toothpaste Green Beauty: do herbal toothpastes work well?

Okay, if you’re anything like me, then you might have asked “what, NOW?” Yeah, it’s NOW, as in NOW Foods with the range of health foods. 100% natural mineral silicate Anyway, I’m not going to introduce the brand anymore than what I just did. We’ll keep this review short by just focusing on the product on hand. NOW European clay Powder is described as a 100% Montmorillonite, which is a natural mineral silicate that is designed for normal, combination and oily skin types in need of detoxification, as well as smaller pore size. Apparently, this mask will help draw out impurities from the pores and remove debris from under the skin, decreasing pore size and improving skin tone. Versatile for all skin types This product reminds me of rhassoul clay that I was using back in 2008. It also reminds me of a dead sea mud mask. It just smells like mud and I’m sure Nermal would have love this as its mud pack. Me? I love it! It’s easy to use: for oily skin, mix 1 tablespoon of NOW European Clay with one teaspoon of water; for dry skin, add a few drops of Jojoba Oil and/or Lavender Essential Oil to the mix prior to applying. Thoroughly cover the face and neck avoiding sensitive areas and the eyes, allow to set for 15-20 minutes, rinse off and apply moisturizer. Might cause breakout on initial usage I’m not sure about smaller pore size but for me, the result of using this is a really cleansed face feeling soft and smooth. But I warn you: if you’re acne prone or you haven’t been detoxing your skin for awhile, you’re going to experience some amount of “purging” using this product. I experienced a bit of breakout around my forehead the first time but thankfully, that was all and I now use this about once a week. Anything more, it can become over drying, considering I only add water to the clay and nothing else. Price and availability I got this from iHerb for US$4.57. It’s a 170g tub and I expect it to last me quite awhile since I don’t need to use too much each time and I’m using it just once a week. You can also read up the 300+ positive reviews, with many raving and heaping praises for this clay powder. © www.vivawoman.net copyright notice ☺ ______________________________________________________________ Related posts: Herbal Healing Clay Masque with Kaolin DIY Beauty: Bentonite clay face mask *meow* Mud & clay based masks for oily skin DIY Beauty: clay and healing herbs face scrub"],"Author":["Sesame"],"Date":["None"],"_template":"657e-4898-839c","_cached_page_id":"693d05dbd57b697e569678bd746f56501f65ff01"}
{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Title":["DIY Beauty: clay and healing herbs face scrub"],"url":"http://www.vivawoman.net/2008/09/diy-beauty-clay-healing-herbs-scrub/","Text":["I received a sample of the Deep Cleansing Scrub which is a dry mix from Yours Essentially about three weeks ago. I have heard of some ladies who love using such DIY scrubs and masks and was fairly keen to try this. And since I had the hydrosols on hand, it was easier for me to use those as the wetting agent to the scrub. French green clay with other healing herbs to cleanse From what I’ve picked out from the website, this scrub uses a base of french green clay with healing herbs to gently deep cleanse dead skin cells and impurities, resulting in softer and smoother skin texture. It smells herbal and is powder like, though they’re not exactly finely milled. Blended to a paste and rubbed on skin as a scrub I tried pouring some of the dry mix on my palm and used a disposable pipette to pick out some amount of the Rose Geranium Hydrosol to mix it in. Because the powder isn’t exactly fine, so I couldn’t get it to blend to a smooth paste. I could feel some bits of the mix but it worked well as a scrub this way when I rubbed it on my face. The first time I left it for about 5 minutes and rinsed off but the second time, I left it slightly longer for about 10 minutes before washing off. Pores looked a lot smaller immediately afterwards I could feel my face tightening as soon as the scrub dried up on my skin. In fact, that’s really the cue to wash off. I have to concede that my pores looked a lot tighter afterwards! In fact, I was very pleased with how I looked. I didn’t have any breakouts from using this but I think the deep cleansing caused some of my clogged pores to emerge in the form of one or two blackheads a day later. More suitable for oily to combination skin The Deep Cleasning Scrub from Yours Essentially contains French Green Clay, Organic Oat Bran, Apricot Kernel Meal, Brown Rice Powder, Certified Organic Lavender Flower Powder, Certified Organic Comfrey Root Powder, Yucca Root Powder, Pink Rose Powder, Certified Organic Licorice Root Powder, Certified Organic Slippery Elm Bark Powder. Although the scrub is said to be suitable for all skin types, I feel that this might work better for those with combination to oily skin type because the French Green Clay, also known as Sea Clay, possess properties to absorb due to the constitution of its micro molecules. Can be mixed with normal cleanser as an exfoliator Instead of using hydrosol, it is possible to use facial water or mineral water in place as wetting agent. Alternatively, you can also try mixing it with your cleanser though the effect was less interesting for me. Summary This is my first experience using a dry mix scrub and I’m quite happy with it. I can also see this as a cheaper and definitely more natural alternative to purchasing a commercial facial scrub. The good thing is that Yours Essentially also offers a variety of other clays for different skin conditions. If you’re trying it for the first time, I suggest you get the sample size which cost S$4.00 for 1/2oz and the content comes in a small ziploc bag. In fact, that can last you a few scrubs. And if you do not find what you want at the online store, you can always email them for a custom blend according to your need. © www.vivawoman.net copyright notice ☺ ______________________________________________________________ Related posts: Herbal Healing Clay Masque with Kaolin DIY Beauty: how to wash your face with rhassoul clay DIY Beauty: Bentonite clay face mask *meow* Holistic healing Gua Sha face therapy at Geranium"],"Author":["Sesame"],"Date":["None"],"_template":"657e-4898-839c","_cached_page_id":"882cea129904530dcc1a89648cda6622d239489d"}
{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Title":["Mud & clay based masks for oily skin"],"url":"http://www.vivawoman.net/2009/07/mud-clay-based-masks-for-oily-skin/","Text":["According to a recent newsletter by The World Of Organic Skincare, mud and clay masks are great for balancing out oily skin – a view that is also echoed by Howard Donsky, M.D., an associate professor of medicine at the University of Toronto and staff dermatologist at Toronto General Hospital. According to Dr Donsky, “Clay masks or mud masks are worthwhile.” However, he also cautioned that masks will make skin feel good and look better only temporarily. Additionally, the darker brown the clay (mud), the more oil it can absorb. White or rose-colored clays, though, are gentler and work best on sensitive skin. (Source: The Doctors Book of Home Remedies ) Use weekly to balance the skin Well, temporary or not, I certainly like using such products as they’re incredibly easy and fun to use and my skin always feel very refreshed afterwards. There are increasingly more of such products in the market but my preference is always for those that are completely natural. For example, the two favorites that I use on a regular basis – Dead Sea Mud Mask from C’est Naturel and the Herbal Healing Clay Masque from Yours Essentially – are free from additional chemical or synthetic additives. Masks with halloysite clay for deep cleansing And last week, I received the Living Nature Deep Cleansing Mask and The Cleansing Clay Peel , both of which contain halloysite clay, known for its ability to absorb toxins. I have been pleased with the result of the clay peel as mentioned in my review of the Sheer Indulgence Facial at The World of Organic Skincare, and thought it might be something worth trying on a more frequent basis. Need to hydrate skin properly after using such masks However, it is important to note that because such mud and clay masks help to balance out the oil in our skin, you’ll need to pay some attention to nourishing the skin immediately afterwards. Mel Lin, the General Manager of The World of Organic Skincare informed me that because using such masks and clays can be drying for the skin, hence hydrating the skin is an important step after using such products. It is definitely true because I felt my combination skin feeling quite tight after using these. GSS promotion for Living Nature Deep Cleansing Mask By the way, those of you in Singapore may like to know that the 5-pack Living Nature Deep Cleansing Mask is currently on offer at S$29. Each pack should provide about three times of usage so you can use these for 15 weeks since you only need them once a week. This offer is available at The World Of Organic Skincare at their Marina Square Boutique #02-187 or their showroom and clinic at 468 River Valley Road. I’m not certain if you can get the special at Sephora though. © www.vivawoman.net copyright notice ☺ ______________________________________________________________ Related posts: DIY Beauty: Rhassoul clay for oily thin hair L’Occitane Riz Rice for combi & oily skin Do you like to use face sheet masks?

Well, go put on that no-brainer dress already! Well, at least that’s what I do. I love dresses. They’re feminine, they’re pretty, and best of all, they’re no-brainers. I’ve got a few no-brainer dresses that require no ironing and so it’s just slip on, accessorize and I’m ready to go! Here, I’ll show you just a few that I wear to work on some days along with three specific reasons on why I’m so fond of dresses. Reason 1: “matchless” I don’t need to think too hard about what to coordinate with my dress. Oh come on, how wrong can a dress get even without accessories? And it’s always good to know that my limited number of bags and pairs of shoes will always go well with all my dresses. Reason 2: “ageless” I think dresses make me look younger. At least that’s what I’ve observed when others wear dresses – like an ex-colleague who look at least 5 years younger after she switched from wearing corporate suits to dresses. Like how I was once mistaken for being a tertiary student by a taxi driver. Reason 3: “stressless” Because it’s a no-brainer, I never have stresses over my dresses. It’s just one piece of garment to slip in and out and did I tell you how much easier a dress is when I have to visit the ladies? Over to you Okay, your turn now. Do you like wearing dresses? Is there a specific color or design you like or dislike?

If you like chocolate, and you particularly like Hershey’s chocolate, let me warn you: this is very addictive to your senses! Seriously, I had to exercise severe restraint every time I made this as I really wanted so much to just slurped up the concoction. Even though I couldn’t put it in my mouth, the mere scent of this is just DIVINE! And let me tell you – this doesn’t just send my spirits soaring, it actually does make my skin glow too! No wonder Dr. Oz recommended this to be used on the fifth day of Christmas! Protects against UV damage Yes, the famous Dr. Oz had recommended cocoa face mask as according to him, the antioxidants found in cocoa help prevent sun damage. And it’s true because many studies support that cocoa contain cell-protecting flavanol antioxidant compounds: two tablespoons of natural cocoa have more antioxidant capacity than 3 ½ cups of green tea, ¾ cup of blueberries and 1 1/3 glasses of red wine. It’s great to reduce free radical damage and works well when ingested as well as when used topically. And for the skeptics, here is a study which showed that topical application of cocoa plant extracts containing polyphenols and xanthine derivitives prevented photodamage in mice that were exposed to ultraviolet light. Okay, I know we’re not mice but you get the drift. Choosing a suitable cocoa powder The baking section is a good place to find natural, unsweetened cocoa powder. I saw some brands that were cheaper but skipped them because I had questions about the manufacturing process. I also saw some organic versions but they cost quite a lot more. So in the end, I settled for Hershey’s Cocoa and I think it’s a good choice. It cost me nearly S$9 but this tub can last me quite awhile supposing I only use it to make my face masks. Ingredients needed Anyway, Dr. Oz has a recipe that goes like this: 3 tbsp cocoa, 3 tbsp plain yogurt, 1 ½ tbsp raw honey, and 1 ½ tbsp oatmeal. The yogurt is good for its moisturizing properties, the honey to reduce inflammation and redness, while the oatmeal works for sensitive skin. Personally, I only used yogurt with cocoa powder because I prefer to use this as a moisturizing face mask. Leave on for up to 20 minutes So after you’ve whipped this concoction up, just apply it liberally to your cleansed face, leave on for 10 to 20 minutes and then rinse off. You can continue with your normal skincare routine such as applying your toner and moisturizer after that. Warning: remember to keep your face AWAY from a chocolate addict! Radiant the morning after I really like this mask A LOT! I was using oatmeal powder before this but since I ran out of the flour, I’m going to stick to using cocoa powder instead. The thing is, I do see a glow to my face the morning after when I use this but the effects do not last after a day. So hopefully, with continual usage, I’m going to have a beaming radiant face all year round! But even if not, I’m just happy to use it to prevent photodamage! © www.vivawoman.net copyright notice ☺ ______________________________________________________________ Related posts: DIY Beauty: chocolate anti-aging face mask DIY Beauty: homemade hydrating face mask DIY Beauty: creamy coleslaw mask for the face DIY Beauty: Bentonite clay face mask *meow*"],"Author":["Sesame"],"Date":["None"],"_template":"657e-4898-839c","_cached_page_id":"9090cfdb9ae2c4ac57eac8dc0921a2e0c30452a9"}
{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Title":["DIY fabric flower bracelet from an old sweatshirt"],"url":"http://www.vivawoman.net/2011/09/diy-fabric-flower-bracelet-from-an-old-sweatshirt/","Text":["Did any of you join the overnight queue that formed at the first H&M opening in Singapore today? It’s amazing what fashion can do to people huh? I was nowhere near and anyway, prefer to avoid the crowd for I can’t shop when I see too many people. So today’s post is definitely not about H&M but it’s about a DIY fabric flower bracelet tutorial. Yes, my DIY interest has still not waned. Easy to make Fabric flowers are very pretty and I’ve learnt to make a few types. Here, I’m showing you one that takes just 15 minutes to make and all you need are two small pieces of fabric, a pair of scissors, thread and needle. For the purpose of recycling, I used the fabric from one of my son’s old sweatshirt. Tutorial details To make one fabric flower, what I did was to cut a square of around 12cm x 12cm from the old sweatshirt. Then I folded it into four small squares and then cut the corners round so that the square piece becomes something of a rounded shape. Okay, I admit I wasn’t precise in my measurements and so my square was really more like a rectangle. If you want to draw out a circle and cut that out, that’s also feasible. After that, what I did was to sew the edge of the fabric and then gather them together in the center before tying a knot. The last step is to push the edges into the center so that the gathers are not visible. And voila, you’ve got a pretty fabric flower – all done in under 15 minutes. Dual flower effect To get this dual flower effect, I basically made another smaller fabric flower and sewed the small one on top of the big one. To make it look more interesting, I sewed a button in the center. The fabric flower can be sewn onto clothes or made into a necklace. However, here, I’ve made it into a bracelet also using the fabric from the sweatshirt. The method was how I made the DIY t-shirt bracelet . The fabric flower is then sewn onto the bracelet. Make an assortment of different sizes You can visit Viva Woman Facebook Page to take a look at how to create the fabric flowers with the picture tutorial. The fun thing about this project is that you can make different sizes of the fabric flowers given that they’re easy to put together. What you want to put in the center of the flower is also your choice. © www.vivawoman.net copyright notice ☺ ______________________________________________________________ Related posts: Boho chic sweatshirt dress DIY Fashion: t-shirt necklace, scarf & bracelet Star Sapphire Bracelet from JewelrySpice Kanzashi flower hair clips"],"Author":["Sesame"],"Date":["None"],"_template":"657e-4898-839c","_cached_page_id":"933e6b8e092ccc728042f9fed3717e72ffe3005f"}

Cost me $0 Actually, I’ve seen such scarves and necklaces on sale at Etsy and they retail for something like US$14 onwards. But this cost me nothing. Well, the cost of the t-shirt doesn’t count since it’s something I don’t wear anymore and I would have thrown it away anyway. And how long did it take? Just about 20 minutes of my time. Use an old tee with a thin material The old t-shirt is a nice design but it was so small, I cannot fit in it without coming across like a rice dumpling. But because I like the illustration, I was unwilling to throw it out. Good thing that it came in handy for this DIY project and the thin material made it ideal for the layering effect. Only a pair of scissors is required All that is required for this project is a pair of scissors. Snip, snip, tie, tie and I’m done. Okay, I only came up with two items out of the small tee but the necklace can double up as a scarf too. A darker color or a few colors would be nice and I shall work on that for my next project.

Do you like drinking beer? Well, I used to love them, especially the German and Irish beer and will have them at least once or twice a week. However, it’s been a long time since I’ve drank beer again but I recently took some sips from Carlsberg for the sake of my hair. Yes, the beer was for my hair, not for myself. LOL. Beer to add body to hair You must have come across this tip before – using beer to add body to the hair. I used to shampoo my hair with beer as a teen, thinking that it would grow me some hair but really, it only made my hair look fuller. The reason is because beer is a fermented drink containing generous supplies of yeast and vitamin Bs, which are said to repair damaged hair, nourish and boost overall body. In addition, it can also give hair some added shine. Mix, wash and rinse I’ve come across a recipe to make a beer shampoo but I’m not really keen on that as I only want to try this occasionally. Come on, beer isn’t that cheap! You can use beer as a last rinse but in this case, what I did was to add beer to my shampoo and also used it as a rinse after conditioning. It’s really easy but just note that you need to let the beer sit out for awhile to deplete carbonation. Then simply pour out a small amount of beer, and mix in with your shampoo. This mixture lathers very well and you’ll find your hair completely cleansed. Smell is temporary After the shampoo, you will need to use a hair conditioner as beer doesn’t do the job of conditioning. So you can pour some beer over your hair after you have conditioned and washed your hair. Let the beer sit for 5 to 10 minutes and then rinse with lukewarm water. I know some people don’t wash out the beer but no way I want to walk around smelling like a drunkard. In fact, your hair will definitely still smell like beer after your rinse off with water but the smell goes away pretty quickly.

As a matter of fact, I haven’t even visited the site for awhile. But I did today and was blown away by these handmade embroidered silk ribbon necklace pendants! Embroidered rose, daisy, iris, lily, daffodil, sunflower, hollyhocks, chrysanthemum, and more! Wow, they are SO SO pretty! I probably never mentioned it but I have a soft spot for any type of embroidery work. Yes, and I even did embroidered craftwork some years back and I’ll show you one of my pieces in a bit if you like to see. （＾＿－） But first, let me show you some of the lovely embroidered silk ribbon flower necklace pendants from bstudio based in Canada. Brenda, the owner of bstudio, has designed and made quite a number of necklaces but here are some of my favorites. Just look at the silk ribbon embroidered flower cluster made up of three pretty colors: beginning with magenta on the lower part of the stem, then bright pink in the center and finally finishing with a peachy coral for the top. And check out how the blooms are accented with spring green silk ribbon for the leaves and stem. The handiwork is so intricate! You can say they’re so fresh and delicate! I also love the hand embroidered rose in the top picture, which is made with variegated purple silk ribbon with a variety of purple shades throughout the bloom. Never seen a purple rose in my life but I definitely heart this! All the designs are set into an oval metal pendant frame with a matte silver tone finish and is lead and nickel free. Prices for the necklaces vary slightly but most of those I’ve featured here cost around S$50, excluding shipping. Brenda ships internationally and you can check out her store for the fees. And here’s what I put together some years ago. I had a bit more time then and decided to dabble with some embroidery. I don’t know why I love embroidery work so much but it could have been influenced by my mom. I used to watch her embroider pretty flowers on the pillow cases and was kinda of fascinated with her needlework. If I remember correctly, these are one-stitch embroidery. The cute visuals were copied from a Japanese craft book and I had stitched a few hankies for fun too. I really like to get back to doing them again but I haven’t been able to find time. Well, maybe when in a few more years? Haha…definitely a pretty idea to retire to eh? © www.vivawoman.net copyright notice ☺ ______________________________________________________________ Related posts: How I store & organize my handmade necklaces Handmade necklaces with charming details Ruffle up your neck with these DIY necklaces Handmade jewelry with Czech glass flowers"],"Author":["Sesame"],"Date":["None"],"_template":"657e-4898-839c","_cached_page_id":"84377ff5d07d62e7c542c29533e16514311e0915"}

I love the antique bone finish and Bina was really nice to make me a pair of complimentary earrings also using Czech glass flowers to match the necklace. Since then, I find myself particularly drawn to jewelry made with Czech glass flowers. I think it’s the whole romantic and whimsical appeal that make designs using these little flowers really attractive to me. While shopping on Etsy yesterday, I came across a few that were interesting. These were not made with oxidized sterling silver but rather silver or sterling silver. I particularly liked a couple of designs using just a single czech glass flower from Crazy 4 Jewels . I’m not so fond of wearing pure silver designs but I would certainly wear the Silver Song Bird Necklace and the Flower and Fern Pendant with Wasabi Flower Necklace you see here because of the pretty Czech glass flowers used.

And coincidentally, I started using one of these bizarre colors again in my daily makeup and that color is purple. Benefits of using an odd color of foundation According to this post in Total Beauty, it seems like these bizarre face powder are no longer confined to just being concealers or correctors. Apparently, makeup artists swear by these colored powder as they can highlight your best features, make your makeup look flawless and give your skin a serious glow. Uses for different colors of face powder According to the experts, different colors work to provide different results and here are some ideas: Yellow—hides undereye circles, dark spots and purple blotches. Green—covers redness, acne and rosacea. Lavender—hides bruises and improves sallow complexions. Mauve—conceals bruises, veins and undereye circles. Peach—livens up skin tone and balances slight skin discoloration. White—lightens darker foundations and enhances features. Purple base evens out skin tone I was introduced to such strange colors some years back. They were very pretty colors and I was recommended a purple powder to help correct my uneven skin tone. I used to apply it first like a base to neutralize the flaw, followed by my normal foundation shade. However, it got quite cumbersome and I felt that I was actually applying powder twice to my face, which made my makeup quite thick if I wasn’t careful. Obviously, the result wasn’t all that ideal. So what I do now is to mix the purple shade with my beige foundation powder and the combination works so much better! Plus the shade turns out to be more flattering for my skin tone. Mineral foundation powder from LA Splash Like I’ve mentioned, many brands have such bizarre shades of face powder but the ones I use are mineral foundation powders from LA Splash. The brand is available at selected Guardian Pharmacies. I also remember they have other colors like white, green and yellow. I was using this brand for awhile before I stopped to experiment with others. However, I decided to repurchase as I had good experience with their powders. So any of you like using “bizarre” colors on your face?

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Title":["5 reasons why you may need a sulfate-free shampoo"],"url":"http://www.vivawoman.net/2013/04/5-reasons-why-you-may-need-a-sulfate-free-shampoo/","Text":["When it comes to hair products, sulfates are often said to be best avoided. Why? They can be damaging for your hair and your hair follicles. However, unless you’re looking at a no foam shampoo, chances are, your shampoo is going to contain some sort of sulfate. But the most common and also most notorious ones to take note are really sodium lauryl sulfate, sodium laureth sulfate and ammonium lauryl sulfate. Shampoos containing these ingredients are best avoided if you can help it (unless they’re listed way down the ingredient label) for the following reasons: 1. Sulfates can cause you hair loss It’s kind of ridiculous when you read the labels of some of these so-called hair loss shampoos. I mean we have studies to support that sodium lauryl sulfate causes damage to the hair follicle and can contribute to hair loss and yet, this is the ingredient that I often see listed in the top five on some of these shampoos. 2. Sulfates can give you scalp acne The same study also indicates that 1% and 5% sodium lauryl sulfate produced significant number of comedones, which can develop into zits when they become inflammed and red. Have you ever had acne on your scalp? Then you’ll know what I mean by “ouch”! 3. Sulfates can irritate your scalp and face If your scalp and skin are sensitive, then you need to know that prolong usage of products with both sodium lauryl sulfate and ammonium lauryl sulfate can cause irritation as they are irritants in patch testing at concentrations of 2 percent and greater ( source ). So shampoos containing such ingredients are really a double whammy because they can irritate both your scalp and face. 4. Sulfates can strip the natural oil from your hair and scalp Sulfates are great for cleaning up oil and greasy buildup. However, it can be too harsh when used on a long term basis on the hair and especially if the formula has insufficient conditioning agents. And when used on those with oily scalp, it can be a problem as the dryness may promote more secretion of oil. 5. Sulfates can strip your hair color If your hair is colored, it is best to opt for a sulfate free shampoo. There appears to be no studies to support this and the issue is divided. However, sulfates are well known as harsh detergents and hence, while they clean very well, is also prone to stripping what’s on the hair. A few people I know personally have told me they maintain their hair color better using a sulfate-free shampoo. Alternative to sulfates Anyway, sulfate-free shampoos may still contain surfactants but they are usually milder, like decyl glucose, coco glucoside and lauryl glucoside. Sulfosuccinates is also considered a milder sulfate while cocamidopropyl betaine, a co-surfactant, is another ingredient often seen in natural formulations. I’m fine with that ingredient but understand that it does not work well for some of you. Variants of sulfates And while sodium lauryl sulfate, sodium laureth sulfate and ammonium lauryl sulfate are what I’ll generally avoid when choosing a shampoo, I’ve come to realized that there are also other variants of sulfates like ammonium laureth sulfate, sodium myristyl sulfate, sodium myreth sulfate, sodium coco-sulfate or the same ingredient called differently such as sodium dodecyl sulfate. Like recently, I almost bought a new shampoo in the natural category but stopped short when I spotted sodium coco-sulfate in the list. So much for an everyday natural shampoo! © www.vivawoman.net copyright notice ☺ ______________________________________________________________ Related posts: Adamsfield SLS-Free Restorative Foaming Shampoo Do foam free shampoos work at all?

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Title":["Burt’s Bees Very Volumizing Shampoo"],"url":"http://www.vivawoman.net/2009/07/burts-bees-very-volumizing-shampoo/","Text":["I fell out of love with Burt’s Bees after they were bought over by Clorox in 2007 but this Burt’s Bees Very Volumizing Pomegranate & Soy Shampoo is making me love the brand all over again! It’s rocking good stuff and until now, I still can’t believe that a natural shampoo free of Sodium Lauryl/Laureth Sulfate can give my fine limp hair volume and also control my greasy scalp at the same time! I’ve never harboured much hopes to find a natural shampoo that can work on my peculiar hair condition. This is why while I avoided SLS in my skin care products, I’ve never been adversed to it in my shampoos. However, Phytocedrat that I was using did not give my hair volume and somehow, Redken Headstrong, the other shampoo I alternate with, seems to have lost its volumizing magic. Fast moving best seller at Sephora in ION Orchard So when I saw how quickly Burt’s Bees Very Volumizing Pomegranate & Soy Shampoo appears to be moving off Sephora’s best sellers’ shelf space, I decided to get it. It’s S$18, which is in the same price range I pay for my current shampoos. Delicious sweet scent with good foaming abilities Okay, I like the fact that this contains pomegranate because it would mean the smell should be delicious. True enough, this shampoo comes with a refreshingly sweet smell and is such a joy to use every morning. I was initially worried that this won’t foam well since it doesn’t contain SLS. But the coconut and sunflower oils do a great job of creating a very rich lather! I don’t even have to use more compared to the shampoos that I’ve been using. Removes buildup and provides volume According to information from their website, the pomegranate blended with natural cleansers made from coconut and sunflower oils cleanses gently, removing buildup, while soy amino acids adhere to hair fibers to lift and separate hair, leaving it soft, shiny and full of volume. In fact, I actually felt my hair being thickened while shampooing. And that’s how this very volumizing shampoo is able to transform my fine, limp hair into thicker looking and voluminous hair with extra body. The most surprisingly effect is that my scalp is not as oily as before and I can even go out without using my dry shampoo. The only con is that I felt some resistance when I combed my hair while it was wet but otherwise, my hair looked shiny, soft and bouncy after the usual blow drying. 97.2% natural ingredient list Apart from being sodium lauryl/laureth sulfate free, Burt’s Bees Very Volumizing Pomegranate & Soy Shampoo is also free from paraben and phthalate. The ingredients in this shampoo include water, decyl glucoside, lauryl glucoside, coco-betaine, coco-glucoside, glyceryl oleate, honey, glycine soja (soybean) protein, glycerin, sucrose laurate, betaine, glucose, fragrance, punica granatum (pomegranate) extract, moringa pterygosperma seed extract, soy amino acids, xanthan gum, citric acid, glucose oxidase, lactoperoxidase. Overall summary Looks like my chances of going totally into natural and organic products are a lot higher now that I’ve found this shampoo! I’m totally pleased with the results on my hair and I would definitely recommend Burt’s Bees Very Volumizing Pomegranate & Soy Shampoo if you’re looking for a similar product to give your hair more volume. Although it cost more here at S$18 in Sephora ION Orchard, but it’s totally value for money considering the large 350ml bottle plus the wonderful effects. A conditioner is also available but I did not get it. © www.vivawoman.net copyright notice ☺ ______________________________________________________________ Related posts: Burt’s Bees Baby Bee Shampoo & Wash Burt’s Bees Lip Shimmer Top-rated volumizing hair products Burt’s Bees Pomegranate Lip Balm"],"Author":["Sesame"],"Date":["None"],"_template":"657e-4898-839c","_cached_page_id":"34b11204b0aeb34b8fe81fb25add2fa6f4184e49"}

Okay, maybe a couple of times in a year just because I like to try new stuff. But unlike skincare, I’m a lot stricter about what I use on my hair. I mean for someone with an oily crown of hair that isn’t too thick, I’ll be a fool to take my hair for granted. So when I do try a new shampoo, I have very specific requirements. First, the shampoo should not be formulated with notorious sulfates like sodium lauryl sulfate, sodium laureth sulfate and ammonium lauryl sulfate—because these ingredients cause my scalp to become dry and secrete more oil. Second, the shampoo should be free from silicones. Why? Although silicones are said to be good for hair products, what it really does when used over time is to coat the hair shaft and seal out moisture, possibly clogging the hair follicles. When that happens, hair can become flat and greasy with build-up or dry and straw-like with a lack of moisture. Next, I need a shampoo that is gentle enough for me to wash my hair daily without causing my scalp and hair to be stripped dry. Finally, I cannot use shampoos that causes me to notice more hair drop in the first wash. If that happens, it is a definite red flag for me to stop using the product. No way Jose am I going to stick it out to give the product another chance! So yes, my choices are pretty specific. I need shampoos that are gentle yet effective to balance my peculiar scalp condition without drying it up. A treatment shampoo for sensitive, irritated scalp But thank goodness my requirements are not impossible to meet and there are increasingly more shampoos designed to address my hair concerns—like this KIN Kinactif Calm Shampoo for Sensitive Scalp, a treatment shampoo that can be used to wash all types of hair gently on a frequent basis, while at the same time respecting its natural balance and promises to instantly soothe sensitive and irritated scalps such as scalp psoriasis, scalp eczema and seborrhea dermatitis. Brand history dates back to World War I It was interesting for me to find out that KIN is a Spanish brand that has been around since 1932 after the first World War. Apparently, it came about to meet the needs of women who had became more liberated and active, and wanted to look good. For a brand with such a long history, it is no wonder that KIN has become synonymous with good quality hair products for the hair professionals. KIN Kinactif Calm Shampoo for Sensitive Scalp comes housed in a 250ml bottle and is made with papaya extract, vitamin F-B5 and SEPICALM, a clinically proven active ingredient. It contains no sulfates, no silicones, no alcohol denat and no parabens. For those who are particular about smell, you may like to know that this shampoo has a light and pleasant scent. Here is the full ingredient list: Aqua (water), Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, Decyl Glucoside, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Glycerin, Peg-120 Methyl Glucose Trioleate, Propylene Glycol, Carica Papaya (papaya) Fruit Extract, Sodium Cocoyl Aminoacids, Sarcosine, Magnesium Aspartate, Potassium Aspartate, Panthenol, Calcium Pantothenate, Linoleic Acid, Linolenic Acid, Hydroxypropyl Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Citric Acid, Tetrasodium Edta, Parfum (fragrance) This shampoo is part of the KIN Kinactif treatment range which is a complete line of treatments for hair and scalp formulated using KIN’s Active Inside System (AIS), an encapsulated system of active ingredients that attach themselves to the external hair fibre and then gradually penetrate the internal layers. Uses gentler surfactants While this product is listed as sulfate-free, meaning it contains none of those notorious surfactants like sodium lauryl sulfate, sodium laureth sulfate and ammonium lauryl sulfate, it has combinations of gentler surfactants like sodium lauroyl sarcosinate, decyl glucoside, cocamidopropyl betaine, and sodium cocoyl amino acids. These gentler surfactants allow the shampoo to lather up quite well after being in contact with water. In addition, although the shampoo is formulated without silicones, this formula does not leave hair dry or tangled. Because I’d a glimpse at the ingredient list, I was not surprised that this shampoo yields an abundant amount of lather. But it did require me to work in a good massage on very thoroughly wet hair. What surprised me was how soft my hair felt after shampooing without using any conditioner. In fact, I was initially wondering why I only received the shampoo. pH balanced for most scalps and hair types When quizzed about this, Jerald, the manager of KIN Group in Singapore pointed out that only hair treatment products come with conditioners. However, KIN Kinactif Calm Shampoo is a specific scalp treatment and hence, does not come with one. I don’t know about you but I certainly learned something new there! Additionally, I also discovered that the pH of KIN Kinactif Calm shampoo is about 5.0-5.5, which is the ideal pH for most scalps and hair types. So unlike most shampoos which are alkaline, this product does not require conditioners to neutralise the ph level. Personally, I have no issues using this shampoo alone because I have short hair and I hardly use conditioners anyway. However, those with longer hair might prefer more nourishment as this product does not contain silicone, which is commonly used in hair products to make the hair soft and silky. In that case, they can opt to use KIN Kinactif Nutri Mask for dry and damaged hair, or their Kinactif Energy Mask for weak and fragile hair. Both come in 200ml containers and cost S$48 each. Gentle shampoo that can be used daily Okay, some of you may be wondering how can one tell if this shampoo is really gentle. Well, the tell-tale sign for me was that I didn’t experience any additional hair drop after the first usage. Transition was smooth and like I mentioned, my hair felt really soft. In fact, I would even use the word ‘healthy’ to describe how I felt about my hair and my scalp after using the shampoo. If you have a specific scalp concern (like mine) or you have scalp psoriasis, scalp eczema or seborrhea dermatitis, you might want to consider this treatment shampoo to rebalance your condition. Even if you don’t have a specific scalp condition, you can still consider this product if you’re in the market for a gentle treatment shampoo. Special promotion for all KIN products The 250ml bottle of KIN Kinactif Calm Shampoo costs S$46 inclusive of free delivery within Singapore and is available at Kin.sg. The price seems a tad upmarket but remember that this is a scalp treatment product. Also, if you consider that for that price, you may only get one or two scalp rebalancing treatment at a salon, it isn’t all that expensive after all.

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Title":["Do foam free shampoos work at all?"],"url":"http://www.vivawoman.net/2010/12/do-foam-free-shampoos-work-at-all/","Text":["I was having a discussion with my hairstylist recently and we both concluded that foam free shampoos don’t cleanse our hair too well. My hairstylist has a bit of an oily scalp condition like mine so he can commiserate with my gripe that some naturally formulated shampoos just can’t cut the grease out of my hair. In fact, he is against using shampoos that do not foam as he said that such shampoos can cause more grease buildup, which in turn will cause our hair follicles to be blocked over time and eventually leading to hair loss. Why the need for foam? Okay, let’s be honest and admit: many of us find that shampoos that produce a copious, lubricious and dense amount of foam cleanse our hair better. The foaming does a better job of removing all dirt and grime. Is it psychological? Maybe. While I do try to avoid using shampoos containing caustic cleansing agents such as Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS) and its close relative Sodium Laureth Sulfate (SLES), but I really need my shampoo to produce foaming suds. My experience with shampoos that do not foam is – neither do they cleanse that well even after a second wash. And while those that foam little can cleanse my scalp, but they usually leave my hair looking rather limp and lacking in volume. What are the alternatives to SLS and SLES? Actually, even though most naturally formulated do not contain SLS or SLES, they do contain other foaming agents that are often said to be milder because they are derived from coconut oil, corn or sugar. Examples include: – Sodium Coco Sulfate – Sodium Larylglucosides Hydroxypropylsulfonate – Sodium Trideceth Sulfate – Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate – Disodium Coco-Glucoside Tartrate – Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate – Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate – Disodium Cocoamphodiacete – Cocamidopropyl Betaine natural coconut oil – Decyl Glucoside – Coco Glucoside – Yucca Foaming Extract – PEG-80 Sorbitan Laurate I haven’t researched into each individual ingredient but these are not totally natural and neither are they safer as some of them show up with rather high hazard ratings at EWG. I also find that some naturally formulated shampoos actually contain a few of these surfactants and so it makes me wonder how much gentler are they compared to a shampoo that uses only one surfactant, even if it is SLS or SLES. Maybe some of you have better knowledge in terms of these ingredients can share your thoughts. What about tear free Shampoos? Many baby shampoos are labeled as tearless because they are created with surfactants that are milder and less likely to cause irritation. In addition, most of these baby formulas are made with a blend of soothing ingredients like aloe vera, calendula, chamomile or even oats. However, not all formulas are equal. Some tearless shampoos foam better than others. I’ve had the unfortunate experience of purchasing one that does not foam and I’m so peeved. And the thing is, I don’t know if I should be peeved with the company or myself because this is the second time they’ve changed the formula and I did not notice. Well, this is what happens when you run into a shop, grab a bottle and pay for it without examining it carefully. But gosh, why do they need to change formulas so often and still call the product by the same name??? And so I say, it is time to move on to a new product! © www.vivawoman.net copyright notice ☺ ______________________________________________________________ Related posts: Are your shampoos and conditioners silicone-free? 5 reasons why you may need a sulfate-free shampoo Can shampoos help prevent hair thinning?

Well, at least to me. I’ve come across foaming facial cleansers but a Hair Antidote Restorative Foaming Shampoo? This is a first for me. I can’t say I’m terribly excited about reviewing this product, especially since I’ve never heard of the UK brand, Adamsfield. But given that this product is made to be free from sulfates, parabens, EDTA as well as silicones and is designed for thinning hair, it does sound like a product designed for my haircare needs. Hair loss treatment Adamsfield is based in the United Kingdom but the products are manufactured in Malaysia. The company has received acclaim for its research into hair and scalp issues, having developed a breakthrough formula for the treatment of hair loss. The company’s positioning is slightly unique: on one hand, it offers a range of animal cruelty free, naturally derived products. On the other hand, the company uses modern science to develop a new generation of haircare cosmeceutical products. Ingredient list Aqua, sodium lauroyl sarcosinate, disodium laureth sulfosuccinate, maltooligosyl glucoside/hydrogenated starch hydrolysate, xantham gum, polyquaternium-10, guar hydroxypropyltrimonium chloride, 2,4 diamino pyramidine oxide, glycerin, vaccinium macrocarpon (cranberry) fruit extract, vaccinium angustifolium (blueberry) fruit extact, punica granatum fruit extract, euterpe oleracea fruit extract, grape seed extract, ppg-5-ceteth-20, dmdm hydatoin (0.2%), menthol, fragrance, citric acid. test Supports follicle health This Adamsfield Hair Antidote Restorative Foaming Shampoo is described as a gentle, daily use sulfate-free shampoo developed specifically for thinning hair. Incorporating Aminexil SP94® to support follicle health, the shampoo features a specially designed foam pump for optimum foaming and lather. So even though this product is sulfate-free, it lathers and foams up very well. Extremely well actually. Better for dry hair type My first impression of the product was the lovely kinda-fruity scent. Although I have no issues with its cleansing prowess, I didn’t quite like how the shampoo leaves a slightly oily residue on my hair. While the formulation is designed to stabilize oil production and not strip the scalp of its protective barrier, I was uncomfortable that the shampoo leaves a slightly oily residue on my hair. It feels as if my hair wasn’t well shampooed. In fact, because of this, my hair didn’t have as much volume as compared to when I didn’t use it and it got oilier quicker in the day. Don’t need a hair conditioner I’m not so sure if this product truly restores thinning hair but I believe it has helped strengthen my hair follicles. So perhaps with longer term usage, those with thinning hair will benefit more. I wouldn’t mind continuing using this if not for the fact that it doesn’t work my for rather limpy and oily hair. On a slightly positive note, I don’t really need a conditioner with this shampoo because it’s quite nourishing.

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Title":["Review of Jurlique Balancing Foaming Cleanser"],"url":"http://www.vivawoman.net/2011/09/review-of-jurlique-balancing-foaming-cleanser/","Text":["I probably used like three or four of Jurlique’s products before but over time, I’ve kind of lost interest in the brand because their products are pricey and I turned to other choices. So after a long break, this is the first Jurlique product I’ve purchased after the company changed their packaging. Truly, I bought it only because I was given a voucher at the airport and there were limited choices. And I picked this Balancing Foaming Cleanser because I figured I needed something to cleanse my face after my Ren Cleansing Gel runs out. Use of ingredients via biodynamic farming Jurlique’s selling point is the use of botanical ingredients via biodynamic farming from their own 153-acre farm. You will find that the ingredients on their products are not certified organic but the company reports that they never use pesticides or herbicides on their farm. I believe I was rather impressed with their products when I first tried them but I’ve since taken on a different perspective towards the brand, especially since I’ve tried organic skin care that are in the same market position. While I certainly don’t mind trying their products, but I’m uncertain if I’ll part my money for them. It’ll probably have to take a good sale to make me do so now. For normal and combination skin type Anyway, this Jurlique Balancing Foaming Cleanser is for normal and combination skin type. There is another Purifying Foaming Cleanser that I’ve tried before back in the old blue packaging. According to information on the company’s website, this Balancing Foaming Cleanser is described as a revitalizing cleanser that clears skin of impurities and leaves skin feeling clean and balanced. It contains ginseng root and rosehip oil, which are also supposed to help improve skin’s firmness and reduce visible signs of aging. In addition, gingko biloba, marshmallow plus vitamins C & E provide intense hydration and antioxidant protection. SLS/SLES free but contains 3 different surfactants So this cleanser does not use SLS or SLES but the second, third and fourth ingredients are surfactants, which actually makes this cleanser somewhat drying on my skin compared to other non-SLS/SLES cleansers I’ve tried. It’s not that bad but it’s noticeable to me since I’ve been using SLS/SLES free cleansers for awhile now. The three different surfactants mean this cleanser foams very well and does a good job of clearing impurities. The scent – a combination of something botanical and something herbal – is very strong and needs some getting use to. Ingredient list Aqua (Water); Decyl Polyglucoside; Cocamidopropyl Betaine; Sodium Cocoyl Sarcosinate; Sodium Cocoyl Glutamate; Glycerin; Chamomilla recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract; Calendula officinalis Flower Extract; Althaea officinalis (Marshmallow) Root Extract; Vitis vinifera (Grape Seed) Seed Extract; Camellia sinensis (Green Tea) Leaf Extract; Hamamelis virginiana (Witch Hazel) Extract; Rosa gallica Flower Extract; Bellis perennis (Daisy) Flower Extract; Prunella vulgaris (Self Heal) Flower Extract; Viola odorata (Violet) Extract; Curcuma longa (Turmeric) Root Extract; Spilanthes acmella Flower Extract; Honey; Lactic Acid; Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein; Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride; Fragrance (Parfum)*; Aloe barbadensis Leaf Extract; Alcohol; Sodium Chloride; Totarol; Citral*; Limonene*. * From Natural Essential Oil (Grapefruit – Citrus grandis; Lemon – Citrus medica limonum; Lemon Myrtle – Backhousia citriodora; Peppermint – Mentha piperita) Packaging Okay, I really need to gripe about this packaging. It’s a plastic pump bottle and I didn’t think it would give me much problems really. However, after using it for awhile, I realized that the pump actually leaks and because of that, the bottle is slightly sticky to touch. Yikes! I’m not sure if this is the only bottle that is leaking but I am not too pleased with it. Price and availability Jurlique Balancing Foaming Cleanser retails at S$44.50 within P&C at the arrival and departure halls of the airport. I’m not sure of the price down at the counter in Tangs but it’s probably quite a bit more. Overall rating Sorry to say, I’m not too impressed by this product and would not repurchase it. It’s definitely not hydrating for me as per its description. In fact, I had almost wanted to get the lotion like cleanser but decided against it after trying this product. © www.vivawoman.net copyright notice ☺ ______________________________________________________________ Related posts: Jurlique Foaming Facial Cleanser An-yong-ha-se-yo: Ecocare Pure Balancing Cleanser Sukin Organic Foaming Facial Cleanser Mukti Gentle Foaming Cleanser and Vitamin Masque"],"Author":["Sesame"],"Date":["None"],"_template":"657e-4898-839c","_cached_page_id":"302d12a09258c450a45581150a79a4e79435db71"}
{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Title":["Jurlique Foaming Facial Cleanser"],"url":"http://www.vivawoman.net/2007/07/jurlique-foaming-facial-cleanser/","Text":["I love this! Jurlique Foaming Facial Cleanser with tea tree, lavender and herbal antioxidants. It smells good, foams up well and cleans my face thoroughly without stripping it dry. The best part is that I don’t need a lot of it for each wash. This product is hypo-allergenic and contains rather high concentrations of natural OPC antioxidants and foaming substances in addition to the tea tree and lavender essential oils. While this is also said to be a cleanser for oily and acne prone skin, it is actually excellent for deep cleansing and yet is gentle enough for all skin types. It removes surface impurities and excess oil, leaving my combination skin clean and extremely refreshed. The 200ml is retailing at S$61 over the Jurlique counter at Tangs. Pricey yes, but it’s made with natural goodness and it will last awhile. I ran a check at Jurlique’s website and noticed that the new batch has been replaced with a white bottle with the same name and is going for S$50 at StrawberryNET.com . Those with very oily skin might be interested to know that there is another foaming facial cleanser specially for their skin type and is going for the same price as well. © www.vivawoman.net copyright notice ☺ ______________________________________________________________ Related posts: Review of Jurlique Balancing Foaming Cleanser Sukin Organic Foaming Facial Cleanser Mukti Gentle Foaming Cleanser and Vitamin Masque Jurlique Herbal Recovery Mist"],"Author":["Sesame"],"Date":["None"],"_template":"657e-4898-839c","_cached_page_id":"1dfc638249ca8ac914b8c79dbf3943f74be88b1f"}
{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Title":["5+1 SLS-free foaming facial cleansers under S$40"],"url":"http://www.vivawoman.net/2011/03/51-sls-free-foaming-facial-cleansers-under-s40/","Text":["It’s no secret that I love facial cleansers that foam and I believe that I’m not alone. Most of us equate foam and lather with more cleansing power. However, we also know that such cleansers shouldn’t be stripping off the natural lipids off our skin. Hence, foaming facial cleansers should be free of Sodium Lauryl Sulfate or Laureth Sulfate (SLS). So today, I’ll put up a summary of five facial cleansers I’ve tried and tested on my combination skin type – drier cheeks with oilier t-zone – that have worked well for me. I’ve also added one extra product, which was reviewed by a reader. More natural formulations Besides being free from laurly sulphates, these cleansers are all positioned as more natural in terms of their formulations, being free from parabens, petrochemicals, synthetic fragrances, and synthetic colours. Some of them even contain ingredients that are certified as organic. The alcohol you see in these formulations are derived from grain and are different from alcohol denat. Although I personally avoid alcohol of all sorts as far as possible in my skin care but the truth is, there are not many formulations that are free from them. But I took a decision to still use them anyway and they have worked well for me, thankfully. Bod White Tea Cleansing Gel 200ml S$36 Ingredients: White tea extract, sodium lauroyl sarcosinate, decyl glucoside, oat protein extract, yucca extract, ylang ylang, geranium, tangerine essential oils, potassium sorbate, xanthan gum, citric acid, sodium hydroxy-methyl-glycinate. This is a transparent cleansing gel that foams rather well because of the sodium lauroyl sarcosinate and decyl glucoside. It’s supposed to contain quite a bit of antioxidant benefits going by the ingredients like white tea and yucca, a native American herb rich in vitamins A, B and C. The oats are to provide soothing qualities and is said to assist with reducing redness in skin. I like the short ingredient list and the product does not even contain plant alcohol! It smells good, worked well for my skin and the bottle lasted me a good 4 months! Available at selected Watsons. A’kin Sandalwood & Neroli Pure Facial Cleansing Gel 225ml S$37 Ingredients: aqua, disodium cocoamphodiacetate (from coconut), lauryl glucoside (from coconut, palm and glucose), sorbitol (non-GMO), sodium cocoyl glutamate (from coconut and sugarcane), glycerin (botanical source), selerotium gum, sodium isostearoyl lactylate (botanical source), witch hazel extract, glyceryl laurate (botanical source), sodium gluconate(non-GMO), sodium citrate (botanical source), citric acid (botanical source), sodium stearoyl lactylate (botanical source), methyldibromo glutaronitrile, phenoxyethanol, panama bark, panthenol (pro-vitamin B5), west Australian sandalwood oil, orange flower water. This one comes in a gel form and foams really well. It worked for me in terms of removing my light makeup and yet left my skin soft and refreshed, even with double cleansing. The scent of scandalwood took some getting used to though, as it is rather strong and it reminds me of some old furniture. But a few days after using this cleanser, the smell stopped bothering me. I also like the rubber stopper, which helps control the amount of cleanser I pump out and this 225ml lasted me around 3 to 4 months. Available at leading Guardian Pharmacies and some organic stores selling skin care too. Thursday Plantation Tea Tree Daily Face Wash 150ml S$18.35 Ingredients: Water, Coco-Betaine, Decyl Glucoside, Chamomile Recutita, (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Oil, Sodium Hydroxymethylglycinate, Eucalyptus Citriodora Oil, Limonene. This one disperses foam right out of the bottle and has a strong tea tree smell. It cleanses well and did not dry up my skin so it’s a decent cleanser. Although the tea tree smell is strong and not particularly appealing, but the smell also left my skin feeling very refreshed. I find this formulation particularly good for those with acne prone skin. This is the cheapest of all the foaming cleansers reviewed here and is available at selected Watsons and Guardian Pharmacies. MADARA Ecoface Deep Purfying Foam 150ml S$39 Ingredients: Aqua, Rosa Damascena (Rose) Distillate*, Sodium Cocoamphoacetate, Alcohol, Glycerin*, Surcose Cocoate, Achillea Millefolium (Yarrow) Extract*, Hypericum Perforatum (St. John’s Wort) Extract*, Calendula Officinalis (Calendula) Extract*, Chamomilla Recutita (Camomile) Extract* *Ingredients issued from Organic Agriculture. This is another cleanser that pumps foam right out of the bottle. It cleanses well and smells wonderful with a botanical scent. It cleanses away light makeup but you will definitely need to double cleanse. So since it is a foam cleanser, I use this only in the mornings as I find it quite a waste to use for double cleansing. No tight or taut feeling after cleansing and face is soft and smooth afterwards. Available at Pure Tincture . L’Occitane Olive Tree Organic Radiance Cleansing Foam 100ml S$36 Ingredients: aqua/water** – olea europaea (olive) fruit water* – disodium cocoyl glutamate** – glycerin** – coco-glucoside** – glyceryl oleate** – decyl glucoside** – mentha viridis (spearmint) leaf oil* – capryloyl glycine** – sodium cocoyl glutamate** – olea europaea (olive) leaf extract* – alcohol* – cocamidopropyl betaine – parfum/fragrance -sodium phytate – sodium benzoate – potassium sorbate – sodium hydroxide – citric acid** – limonene** – linalool**. *ingredient issued from organic agriculture; ** natural origin ingredients. 99.59% of total ingredients are of natural origin. 10.22% of total ingredients of from organic farming. Another cleanser that foams right out of the bottle with ingredients certified as organic by Ecocert; I don’t find anything exceptional about the after effects as I do not see my face becoming more radiant after each wash. I find the scent very strong when I first started using this, and I kept thinking I was stuffing my face with crushed leaves and vegetables. But I find that compared to other foaming cleansers I’ve tried, this one comes across more foamy and I didn’t need to squirt as much. The cleansing power is quite good and my skin was left feeling fresh, clean and non drying. This is the most expensive of the cleansers listed here and is available at L’Occitane stores. Nutriganics Foaming Facial Wash 150ml S$24.90 Ingredients: Aqua (Solvent/Diluent), Sucrose (Humectant), Glycerin (Humectant), Propanediol (Viscosity Modifier), Coco-Betaine (Skin Conditioning Agent), Cocamidopropyl Betaine (Surfactant), Coco-Glucoside (Surfactant), Polyglyceryl-4 Caprate (Skin Conditioning Agent), Sodium Chloride (Viscosity Modifier), Sucrose Laurate (Skin Conditioning Agent), Sodium Benzoate (Preservative), Salicylic Acid (Preservative/Hair Conditioner), Parfum (Fragrance), Linalool (Fragrance Ingredient), Citronellol (Fragrance Ingredient), Orbignya Oleifera Seed Oil (Emollient), Buddleja Davidii Extract (Skin Conditioning Agent), Thymus Vulgaris Extract (Natural Additive), Malva Sylvestris Flower Extract (Natural Additive), Arginine (Skin Conditioning Agent), Citric Acid (pH Adjuster), Potassium Sorbate (Preservative). This was reviewed by Cass and the product is certified organic by Ecocert. This comes in a pump bottle, which disperses cleansing foam. She used this to double cleanse her light makeup and her skin didn’t feel dry. In fact, it left her skin feeling soft. According to her, the smell was acceptable with no artificial fragrance. She highlighted that those with hyper sensitive eyes need to be careful using this as the cleanser stung her eyes when it accidentally got in. But otherwise, she would definitely recommend this product. Available at The Body Shop. Practice of double cleansing All of the five cleansers I’ve recommended worked for me without stripping off my natural lipids and yet keeping my face clean and fresh. However, note that I’ve either used the cleansers in the morning when my face was relatively clean or if I had used them in the evening, I’ve always double cleansed using the same cleanser twice or using it after taking my makeup off with a cream cleanser or oil cleanser. © www.vivawoman.net copyright notice ☺ ______________________________________________________________ Related posts: Facial cleansers: oil, cream, milk or foaming?

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Title":["6 tips on how to extend the shelf life of carrier oils"],"url":"http://www.vivawoman.net/2012/10/how-to-extend-the-shelf-life-of-carrier-oils/","Text":["I don’t buy that many carrier oils these days because I noticed they oxidize and turn rancid very quickly. Like I had to throw out half a bottle of sweet almond oil recently, even though I recalled purchasing it not too long ago. But the funny thing is that I noticed that the same oil in which I had mixed with some drops of astaxanthin still smell okay. It then occurred to me that the best way to extend the shelf life of a carrier oil is by adding an antioxidant. 1. Adding an antioxidant While the astaxanthin I’ve used is helping to preserve the sweet almond oil, but it causes the oil to turn orangey so it’s not the most ideal antioxidant for most people. A better and more common antioxidant to add in a carrier oil is a vitamin E oil. 2. Store in a cool, dark location Oils should be stored away from direct sunlight as the UV rays can damage the oils. The best place to store the oils are in a cool, dark place. 3. Use amber or dark glass bottle For the same reason as keeping away from the sun, carrier oils do better when they’re stored in an amber or other dark glass bottles. 4. Use a smaller bottle Interestingly, I also found out that a smaller bottle can help to extend the shelf life because oxygen that lives in a partially full bottle will react with the oil, causing it to turn rancid quickly. 5. Tighten the bottle cap For the same reason, bottle caps must be tightened for oxygen is an enemy to oils. 6. Keeping in the fridge Putting the oils in the fridge can definitely help to extend the shelf life. Personally, I’ve only tried to refrigerate Emu Oil.

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Title":["Paul Penders Natural Moisture Foundations"],"url":"http://www.vivawoman.net/2012/10/paul-penders-natural-moisture-mineral-foundations/","Text":["Trying to fulfill all my 2012 resolutions is actually harder than I thought. I mean how difficult is it to use makeup which are more naturally formulated? Well, those of you on a similar quest will know what I’m talking about. IT’S DARN HARD! First off, you have issues of limited choices. Next, the issue of unavailability in our market. And I don’t even want to talk about wearability. So with that mindset, I was a bit skeptical about the Paul Penders makeup range when I was first introduced to it. I was even more doubtful when I saw that their mineral translucent power is white! OMG. Can this actually work for me? Natural look great for those with flawless skin But you know what? I actually like it a lot because it works very well with my fair skin tone. And almost every day now, I’m using their Natural Moisture Foundation (which is your equivalent of a liquid foundation) together with their Mineral Translucent Powder. It’s a very natural look and even though my skin isn’t flawless, I think I don’t look quite as bad. So if you have better skin than me with little blemishes and spots, you’ll probably find their foundations to do quite well for you. From my experience, they don’t streak much, cake at all and definitely do not oxidize. Paul Penders Natural Moisture Foundation | 25g, AUD29.50 Ingredients: Aqua (Water), Cocos nucifera (Coconut) extract, Organic LevensESSENTIE Gold® { Angelica archangelica (Angelica) extract, Arnica montana (Arnica) flower extract, Calendula officinalis (Calendula) flower extract, Matricaria recutita (Chamomile) flower extract, Sambucus nigra (Elderflower) flower extract, Zingiber officinalis (Ginger) root extract, Panax quinquefolium (Ginseng root) extract, Lonicera japonica (Honey suckle) extract, Humulus lupulus (Hops) extract, Equeisetum hyemale (Horsetail) extract, Juniperus communis (Juniper) fruit extract, Lavandula angustifolia (Lavender) flower extract, Melissa officinalis (Lemon balm) leaf extract, Urtica dioica (Nettle) extract, Centella asiatica (Penny wort) extract, Mentha piperita (Peppermint) leaf extract, Rosemarinus officinalis (Rosemary) extract, Salvia officinalis (Sage) extract, Hypericum perforatum (St. John’s wort) extract, Curcuma longa (Turmeric) root extract, Hamamelis virginiana (Witch hazel) extract, Archillea millefolium (Yarrow) extract}, Aloe barbadensis (Aloe vera) leaf extract, Polysaccharides (Inulin), Sclerotium gum (Granulated amigel), Ascorbyl isostearate (Vitamin C), Sorbic acid, Ananas comosus (Bromelain) extract, Carica papaya (Papain) extract, Desert flower fragrance, [ +/- (may contain), Titanium dioxide, Iron oxide red, Iron oxide brown, Iron oxide black, Iron oxide blue] test But don’t expect to get similar coverage as the conventional foundations or BB creams. The Paul Penders Natural Moisture Foundation is more like a very tinted moisturizer and hence, the coverage is not luminously flawless. They won’t conceal dark circles nor spots too well either. And strangely, the Paul Penders Natural Moisture Foundation in Hazel Ivory which is very white is quite drying compared to the formulation in Island Sand. Although it can blend into my skin, but I found it to cake up after awhile. So what you see in the picture above is me wearing the Paul Penders Natural Moisture Foundation in Island Sand together with the Paul Penders Mineral Translucent Foundation. The Moisture Foundation in Island Sand is quite moisturizing for my skin and lasted me well throughout the day. The exception is when the weather turns cold or the aircon is on full blast. When that happens, my skin does feel a tad dry with this foundation. Other than the Hazel Ivory and Island Sand I’ve received, four other darker shades are available and they are – Sweet Amber, Wood Brown, Timeless Tan, and Chocolate Brown. The 25g is a very small tube though but the good thing with that size is that this being a natural formulation has a shorter life span and so you wouldn’t have to take forever to finish it up. Paul Penders Mineral Translucent Powder | 5g, AUD28 Ingredients: Mica, Titanium dioxide, Bismuth oxychloride, Organic LevensESSENTIE Gold® {Angelica archangelica (Angelica) root, Arnica montana (Arnica) flower, Calendula officinalis (Calendula) flower, Matricaria recutita (Chamomile) flower, Sambucus nigra (Elderflower) flower, Zingiber officinalis (Ginger) root, Panax quinquefolium (Ginseng) root, Lonicera japonica (Honeysuckle) flower, Humulus lupulus (Hops) flower, Equisetum hyemale (Horsetail), Juniperus communis (Juniper) fruit, Lavandula augustifolia (Lavender) flower, Melissa officinalis (Lemon balm) leaf, Urtica dioica (Nettle), Centella asiatica (Pennywort), Mentha piperita (Peppermint) leaf, Rosemarinus officinalis (Rosemary) flower, Salvia officinalis (Sage) leaf, Hypericum perforatum (St.John’s wort), Curcuma longa (Turmeric) root, Hamamelis virginiana (Witch hazel) leaf, Achillea millefolium (Yarrow) flower} test This Paul Penders Mineral Translucent Powder is described as a finishing touch for a flawless, natural-luminous healthy looking skin. It is white but doesn’t look too white for me. But I think the white do show up on darker skin tone so I’m not really sure how this will work for all skin tones. Otherwise, it’s quite fine and does compliment the Natural Moisture Foundation to yield a smoother finishing. I’ve never used mineral makeup with so much ingredients and neither have I tried one containing Bismuth Oxychloride. But I’m glad to say that after using this for some time now, I don’t have any issues. Paul Penders Mineral Foundation Blusher | 5g, AUD28 Ingredients: Solum diatomeae, Cetyl alcohol, Organic LevensESSENTIE Gold® {Angelica archangelica (Angelica) extract, Arnica montana (Arnica) flower extract, Calendula officinalis (Calendula) flower extract, Matricaria recutita (Chamomile) flower extract, Sambucus nigra (Elderflower) flower extract, Zingiber officinalis (Ginger) root extract, Panax quinquefolium (Ginseng root) extract, Lonicera japonica (Honey suckle) extract, Humulus lupulus (Hops) extract, Equeisetum hyemale (Horsetail) extract, Juniperus communis (Juniper) fruit extract, Lavandula angustifolia (Lavender) flower extract, Melissa officinalis (Lemon balm) leaf extract, Urtica dioica (Nettle) extract, Centella asiatica (Penny wort) extract, Mentha piperita (Peppermint) leaf extract, Rosemarinus officinalis (Rosemary) extract, Salvia officinalis (Sage) extract, Hypericum perforatum (St. John’s wort) extract, Curcuma longa (Turmeric) root extract, Hamamelis virginiana (Witch hazel) extract, Archillea millefolium (Yarrow) extract}, Magnesium stearate, Starch (arrowroot/tapioca/corn), [ +/- (may contain), Mica powder, Titanium dioxide, Zinc oxide, Iron oxide red, Iron oxide brown, Iron oxide black] test I’m not much of blush wearer. Sometimes they turn out nice on me, sometimes they don’t. So I hardly wear them. But I kinda like the Dazzling Rose you see here because it’s a nice pink and compliments my skin tone well. Other than Dazzling Rose, you can find the blush in four other shades – Sunset Pink, Garden Plum, Smashing Bronze, and Red Polka. Color shown on the website is off I’ve got to say that the swatches on their website are a poor representation of the colors. As you can see, Smashing Bronze, which is what you see in the picture below is nowhere near the color shown on their website. It’s so much darker and such a far cry from the pale pink shown on their color chart! That, or the product was incorrectly labeled. Anyway, this Smashing Bronze was sent to me by mistake and so I can’t wear it at all. Certified organic & halal licensed All Paul Penders products are made with certified organic ingredients and the brand is not only 100% vegan but also one of the very few to be certified halal as licensed by the Government of Malaysia.
