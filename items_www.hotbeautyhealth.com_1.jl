{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Title":["36 Hacks For Last Minute Travel Plans"],"url":"https://www.hotbeautyhealth.com/travel/hacks-for-last-minute-travel-plans/","Text":["Conventional wisdom says that travel plans are best made as early as possible, partly because this makes you more likely to get better rates on everything. Unfortunately, there are just too many things that life can throw at you, leaving you with no option but to start planning for a trip on a short notice. And if this sounds like a familiar script, then you’re well aware of how expensive such endeavors can be. That is, if you aren’t aware of any last minute travel hacks you could use to your advantage. Contrary to what you might assume, you don’t have to burn a hole through your wallet when taking a trip on a moment’s notice. Just keep in mind these points, and you’ll be able to save money on your travels: 1. Be flexible Don’t obsess so much about a particular destination that you end up missing on other great deals. Just figure out what exactly you’re seeking from the getaway, then opt for suitable lesser-known spots. 2. Go solo Spontaneous getaways work best when fewer individuals are involved, which is why you’ll want to travel alone if possible. This will give you the flexibility to pounce on almost all the openings that do come your way. 3. Be prepared Most last minute travel deals have a very limited lifespan, which means you must be ready to jump in at a moment’s notice. Start by outlining your packing list and make sure you know where everything is. This will help you depart sooner when the time comes. 4. Have a strategy Ideally, you want to book your flight after you’ve secured a hotel room, particularly if you’re traveling during peak season. Planning will also make it possible to work around other elements that might not fall into place. 5. Cash out in time When traveling to another country, visit your local bank for a currency exchange instead of using airport bureaus. The latter are more likely to rip you off, so make sure you have enough local currency when you first arrive. 6. Look for car hire coupons Renting a vehicle is one of the trickier parts of spontaneous travel, so take advantage of any coupons you come across. Of course, you’ll want to ensure the offer includes your rental location before booking. 7. Cast your net wider If downtown car hire agencies prove too expensive, head out to the suburbs where providers are known to charge less. 8. Try ride sharing When traveling as a group, a car-sharing service will be much cheaper than buying several air/rail tickets or hiring a vehicle the traditional way. You can use Uber anywhere across the globe. Check out this list to see if Uber is available in the country you are travelling too. 9. Think about taking the train Unless you’re taking a route where heavy demand necessitates early booking, last-minute tickets on trains can save you a substantial amount of cash. Keep an eye out for discounted tickets and promotions. 10. Start with single-seat tickets No matter how many people will be accompanying you for the trip, it’s crucial that you start with individual tickets when searching for air fares. Carriers are known to bump prices when several seats are booked simultaneously. READ: 12 Ways You Can Fly For Free 11. Get social When traveling on a short notice, keep an eye out for flash sales that might pop up on social media. Such deals are offered when operators need to fill up a few remaining spots by offering incentives. Besides checking the social streams of your favorite travel companies, you can also inquire directly by sending them a message. 12. Sign up for deals To get travel offers, sign up for newsletters from a few airlines and travel companies. Check your inbox regularly to see if you can find any last minute travel deals among their regular offers. You can also subscribe for alerts from 3rd-party websites and destination-specific paid services, then opt out later on after your trip. 13. Look for packaged deals Opting for an all-inclusive package (flight, accommodation, car hire, etc) is perhaps the most convenient way to save on last minute travel. When researching such deals, try not to think too much about the price of each item, but rather the value you’ll get from the package as a whole. 14. Scan for deals offered via credit card companies Search through your card provider’s website and check your statements to see if there’s anything you could take advantage of. Should you come across a convincing offer, remember to pay for the reservation using your card to lower the cost even further. You’ll also want to pay off the amount before interest charges kick in. 15. Take advantage of transferable points A sudden getaway presents a great opportunity to utilize any reward points you might have accumulated on other programs. Most airlines will only open up award spots on flights scheduled to take off within a day or two, and which still have some seats that are yet to be sold. If you have points spread across other programs associated with a certain carrier, why not consolidate them to maximize their potential? Just make sure you understand the redemption terms so you can pick the best options for your trip. 16. Be consistent Air fares are known to fluctuate with time, as do the number of seats most airlines are willing to offer at the lowest price. Besides, it’s not unusual for someone to reserve such a seat for a while then fail to book. It’s thus important that you keep searching for deals over a long period, of course while making sure you’ll be able to pounce when there’s a deal. To make things easier, leave open a dedicated tab on your browser so you only have to refresh when searching, and complement your efforts using relevant apps. 17. Consult an agent If you can’t find affordable options for your trip, consider working with a travel agency. An experienced agent will have the connections to get you seats that won’t show up on airliners’ sites, not to forget a last-minute reservation as well. 18. Delete your cookies While searching for tickets, remember to clear out your browser cookies and cache, or use a different device altogether. Airlines are known to track consumers online and raise prices whenever interest around particular flights increases. 19. Consult an agent If you can’t find affordable options for your trip, consider working with a travel agency. An experienced agent will have the connections to get you seats that won’t show up on airliners’ sites, not to forget a last-minute reservation as well. 20. Look for and take advantage of errors online Airlines are far from being perfect; even established operators post erroneous fares from time to time, and there are experts online dedicated towards helping consumers find them. While such deals are often for last-minute flights, they’re only valid for the duration it takes for the mistakes to be fixed. You can follow these experts on Twitter or Facebook or through an email subscription. If you follow them on Twitter, you can get them instantly by setting up push notifications on your phone in the account settings: Secret Flying @SecretFlying The Flight Deal @TheFlightDeal The Fare Deal Alert @FareDealAlert 21. Look for consolidator tickets A consolidator is an agency that has contracts with multiple airlines to sell tickets that come from a special pool. While most of them will be on international routes, these deals can save you quite a handsome amount, as long as you have no problem with their restrictions (no changes allowed, and no frequent traveler miles earned). It would thus be prudent to examine the small print closely to see if the deal suits your circumstances. I would try Cheaptickets.com and STA Travel (if you’re a student). 22. Shop around Remember to keep an eye out for cheaper fares even after you’ve booked your flight. This means you’ll need to understand all the costs attached to each offer and, as a result, make sure you’re getting the best deal currently available. Should you come across a better deal, see if you can switch by canceling the remaining portion of your trip. 23. Purchase tickets in local currency Air tickets tend to be more expensive when the price is quoted in converted rates, which is why you want to purchase them in the local currency. Here, you’ll need to book directly with the airline on their native website, or via international aggregator platforms. 24. Make good use of your air miles Frequent flier miles often come in handy when fares spike, and the thresholds can actually be lower than what you think. Some carriers offer last-seat availability on local flights at less than 30 000 miles, even around the holiday season, which is the kind of deal you need to get value for your accumulated mileage. 25. Skip round-trip tickets Today, purchasing two one-way tickets into and out of the same city (preferably on different airlines) often proves more cost-effective than booking a single return ticket. You’re also more likely to get favorable arrival/departure times with the former. Keep in mind that you’ll be required to provide proof of your return flight when crossing borders, so make sure to carry along the relevant documents. 26. Take a different route Rather than book an expensive non-stop flight, consider taking advantage of the ‘hidden city ticketing’ technique. Here, you’ll start by looking for a multi-city flight whose stopovers include your preferred destination but cost cheaper than booking a flight directly to your destination where you pay more. Here’s an example: Let’s say you want a book a flight to Chicago from New York. A plane ticket going to Los Angeles from New York cost $300; but, stops mid-way in Chicago, whereas a planet ticket from New York to Chicago cost $400. Obviously the flight to L.A. is cheaper so you’ll just get off at the stopping point as opposed to the ticketed destination, saving a tidy amount in the process. It’s worth mentioning that method involves taking on a bit of risk, so tread carefully. You can read some of the drawbacks here . 27. Opt for carriers who offer refunds If tickets fall in price after you’ve paid, you’ll obviously want to get a refund for the difference. This will depend on the policies of the carrier in question; while some will have no problem issuing vouchers to refund the entire sum, others will apply hefty fees and as a result wipe out any savings you’d have made. 28. Timing is crucial Even if you’ve figured out the destination and time of departure, don’t make the mistake of booking too early. Air fares vary considerably during the months leading up to a flight, so be patient. Depending on how flexible your dates are, searching within the +5/-5 date range will yield a variety of rates for you to consider. 29. Consider switching airports As you search, try switching up the hubs to see how it affects the price. Some sites will show you the various options you could use to lower your price, besides notifying you when bargains pop up. 30. Try to avoid business travelers To save on your last minute travel flight, take advantage of the mid-week discounts offered by most airlines. The rule of thumb here is to stay away from premium-paying business travelers, which means sticking to flights scheduled for Tuesday, Wednesday and, at times, Saturday. 31. Consider taking an opaque reservation To help fill rooms that would otherwise have gone empty, hotels will at times offer huge discounts via online agencies. The only catch here is that you’ll only get to know the name and address of the hotel after completing the non-refundable reservation. 32. Try hotel-hopping Commonly used by last minute travel deal seekers to save on accommodation, this technique involves staying at more than one hotel by booking each night separately. There are several sites you could use to look for great multi-night deals, taking into account your preferences and the number of times you’re willing to switch hotels. 33. Check out newly-opened facilities Taking advantage of offers from hotels that have just opened is another way to save on accommodation for your spontaneous getaway. Here, you can actually save more than 50% on your stay, but make sure you act quickly, since the deals are only available for a limited period. 34. Ask for deals directly Before booking, contact the hotel and ask if they have any deals currently on offer. You never know — they may offer a free upgrade, a discount, or anything else that will make your stay there worthwhile. This is something you should always look into when staying in one city for more than a week. 35. Be persistent Do you know that you can actually negotiate with hotels for better rates? This might not be what immediately comes to mind when planning a sudden getaway, but it gives you the perfect opportunity to use your unique attributes to your advantage. Most hotels will have no problem lowering rates for military and government personnel, as well as seniors. As mentioned, persistence is the name of the game here. 36. Explore cheaper alternatives Can’t find a hotel within your budget? Start exploring other options, including condominiums, boutique motels, hostels, Airbnb , bed & breakfast establishments and home-based providers. Such facilities often provide great services for much less than the going rates of the cheapest hotel rooms in the same locality. Besides, each of them will have you dealing directly with the owner, which translates to more negotiating power for you.

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Title":["50 Packing Essentials to Survive a Road Trip"],"url":"https://www.hotbeautyhealth.com/lifestyle/road-trip-packing-list/","Text":["The excitement of a road trip can sometimes be slightly dimmed by the difficulty over what to pack. While on one hand you may be willing to travel light, on the other, you don’t want to be relentlessly berating yourself for the items you left behind. So whether you are planning to drive across a state or across the continent, here is a road trip packing list of 50 essential items that you need to take with you: Road Trip Packing List: 50 Essentials 1. Music/Playlist: Your mood is likely to change quicker than you think, especially when you get into unlucky situations. So before you even put key in the ignition , ensure that you have at least 30 playlists for the trip. I mean serious, what’s a road trip without music. If you need a fresh set of tunes, try Tune In Radio app at Apple iTunes or Google Play . You can choose from list of 50,000 radio stations from around the globe. This is also an opportunity to learn the names of new artists. Don’t forget your headphones! 2. First Aid Kit: Whether you accidentally cut yourself while gathering wood for a camp fire or you have just eaten a wrong snack on the road, first aid kit will come in handy than you think. 3. Camera: You will need to take some photos to remember the trip and memorize that delighted look on your face when you reached your favorite destination ( Great gift idea! See Amazon’s Most Wished For List ). 4. Snacks/Food: Your wallets will get empty sooner than you think when you are constantly eating out. Though eating at different restaurants is often one of the most exciting parts of a road trip, you can always do your wallet and health a favor by carrying your own snacks/food. 5. Mosquito Spray: Gotta keep the bugs away! 6. Sunglasses: To protect your eyes from those harmful UV rays. Definitely a must! 7. Hand Sanitizers: You can’t predict the amount of dirt your hands will be exposed to. 8. Auto Essentials: A spare tire and some motor oil, among other motor essentials can help you a great deal when you wind up with a minor accident or when you misjudge the distance from destination A to B. 9. Sleeping Gear: There are unprecedented numbers of places that you can sleep under the stars if you wish not to waste your hard earned cash staying in a hotel every night? If you do need to stay in a hotel, I would suggest booking a room in advance, through Vacay Bookings . At least you can save some money with their price comparison search engine. 10. National Identification card or Driver’s License: These will confirm that you are indeed a homosapien who pay bills and taxes. 11. Travel Alarm Clock: Hotel wake up calls can sometimes be bothersome. You need a familiar sound that will wake you up without a problem. 12. Good Friends: Your company is ultimately what will make your road trip worth it. 13. Portable Power Device: To keep your phone and tablet charged at your convenience take a portable charger . Never rely on rest stops and hotels to recharge your electronic essentials. 14. Journal: A record of those weird local jokes, breakthroughs, surroundings, and thoughts will help you process them later. 15. Keys: You cannot afford to get very far without them. 16. GPS: Your phone’s GPS will be great until you find yourself in No man’s land with no internet or network coverage, and worse a drained battery. So, I don’t recommend using your phone’s GPS. Instead, A GPS like Garmin or TomTom will come in handy when you hit heavy traffic and need to find alternate routes. 17. Sofa Cushions: No matter the number of songs that you listen to or the number of stories you tell, eventually boredom will set in. This is the time that your friends in the backseat will need to build a fort out of the cushions. 18. Map: Navigating your destinations with a real map is not only a fun challenge but makes you feel like a real explorer as well. 19. Phone: Besides updating your friends about the destination that you will be spending a given night, you can jam to your favorite music playlist while updating your Instagram feed from the road. 20. Sunscreen: A road trip without sun protection is a recipe for disaster. Be sure to lather up on sunscreen periodically throughout the trip. 21. Water: You have to stay hydrated throughout the trip. Don’t even think about soda or juice ; they will make thirst worse. 22. Extra set of Keys: You never know when you will lose the set you are used to. 23. Binoculars: There will be several moments when you will want to whip out your binoculars to get a clearer look at stuff off in the distance. 24. Appetite: You will be snacking on those chemically loaded snacks you never thought you would, under normal situations, put in your precious body. 25. Hygiene Bag: You will hardly come by showers while on the road. A hygiene bag with deodorant and towelettes will help cover those unfriendly stenches of sweat. Also bring eco-friendly shampoo and shower soap if you’re lucky enough to stumble upon a lake or outdoor shower. 26. Safety Pins: To mend some of your wardrobe malfunctions, clasp the zippers of your day packs together, tack your kid’s pant legs, especially when they are hiking through a mucky terrain among other uses. 27. Pocket Knife: You cannot simply count the number of times that you will use or need to use a pocket knife . 28. Lucky Charm: To keep you free from those bad road juju. For ladies, this will allow you to easily find keys amidst piles of lip glosses, hum packs and old movie stubs. It’s a great item to add to your road trip packing list. 29. Games and activity sets: A deck of cards or backgammon will break up the monotony of the trip. 30. Roadside Emergency Kit: This kit will come in handy in case something goes wrong. 31. Rain Gear: People get rained on even in the desert! A rain gear or waterproof jacket will be useful when you visit misty destinations as well. 32. Tote Bag: To toss around picnic and beach items. You can also use them to cordon off dirty laundry items in your suitcase to preserve the freshness of the unused items. 33. Comfortable items: Wearing comfortable clothes during your time in the car is a given but you should also bring a blanket or a sweater in case you travel through a mountainous area at night or you disagree about an appropriate level of air conditioning with your travel mates. 34. Reading materials: A book or magazine will help you pass time, especially if you like reading. 35. Folding Shovel: A definite must-have in my road trip essentials list. You may need a folding shovel to dig out your truck’s tires from unexpected snow or to fill spots where you are stuck in the mud. 36. Good Walking Shoes: Though this sound like a normal road trip gear, you will seriously need them, especially if you find yourself wandering in grounds where flip-flops or flimsy shoes just won’t do. 37. Travel Mug: To stash transport sunglasses and other delicate souvenirs in your hotel room. Remember, a coffee-stained mug is an unlikely target for thieves. 38. Garbage bags: When you plan a long drive, it is always a great idea to have a few garbage bags to empty trash after each day’s drive. 39. Toilet paper: This will be very handy whenever you think about having that Big Gulp from 7-Eleven. 40. Voting system: To guide you and your team on how you decide on when to stop or where to eat. 41. Silicone Travel Bottles: Generally, TSA-approved mini travel bottles are often considered old news to any avid road traveler. 42. Duct Tape: From bandaging your exploded items to removing lint from your clothing, duct tape will always earn its all-purpose reputation. 43. A cooler: To stuff restaurant leftovers, roadside snacks, soda and anything you want to keep cold. This is a lot cheaper than constantly buying beverages and related food stuffs at roadside stops or gas stations. 44. Underwear: Bring more of them (even 10 more pairs) than you would practically need. 45. Positive Attitude: Nasty things that will push your buttons will obviously happen on the road. You need just to have a positive attitude and remember that pretty soon you will be back home on your comfortable couch. 46. Bandana: The list of obvious uses for this versatile carry-on is long—you can use it as a lens cleaner, hair tie, hand towel, scarf, head band or a cooling devise (when you dampen it). 47. Ziploc Bags: To prevent sandy beachwear from soiling your items and to protect some of your delicate clothing from snags. 48. Multi socket Power strip: This will help you charge most of your electronics at a go. Besides, plugging all your electronic in the same place, a multi socket power strip lessens your chances of leaving any behind. 49. Disinfectant Spray: It’s convenient when you plan to stop by public places like a restaurant or hotel. 50. Plan B: No matter how prepared you are, sometimes a road trip may not work out. Reveal your alternate vacation plan early to avoid crying out loud if things don’t go as planned. Your road trip packing list plays a major role in the outcome of your road trip, especially if you are not used to long trips. Remember to always be well-prepared and hopefully this road trip essentials list will help make packing easier for you.

All opinions are 100% mine. Storage, storage, storage. There never seems to be enough of it in my house. I have a very small bedroom with an even smaller closet. For years, I’ve always complained about the lack of space which oftentimes stops me from buying new clothes. I’ve now come to the realization that my problem is letting go of pretty little things or justifying keeping pieces I no longer need. So, what I have now is a small overflowing closet full of unnecessary items and it’s time for me to finally do something about it. Spring is just around the corner and I’m dying to buy all the things on my spring wishlist, but given the state of my closet, I first need to figure out a way to reorganize it. Right now my top shelf is full of bulky shoe boxes that I’ve had since college. I don’t even wear half of them anymore. I also have tons of old clothes I should’ve a tossed or given away years ago. Thankfully, I came across a new line of SOFI products on Amazon designed to make spaces work the way you live. It offers an essential, style-smart organizational system in a variety of styles that can instantly transform your closet into your own chic boutique. I love that you don’t need to sacrifice style when organizing your closet with this line. Some of my favorites include the SOFI Hex Box (perfect for drawers, nightstands and dressers to store jewelry, socks, and other small trinkets that can be easily lost), SOFI Rax Bin (ideal for at-a-glance access to purses, hats and footwear), SOFI Brix Box, Small (easily accessible with pull-out handles and open tops), and SOFI Zipper Tote, Small (allow for quick access to clothes and accessories). They’re perfect for my closet needs and I like that they have environmentally-friendly features (made from a minimum of 65% recycled content). I also love the sophisticated mocha and lavender-grey color palette on the exterior and interior, respectively. Sofi Hex Box Spring Cleaning Closet Tips! Monica Friel , organizing expert from Chaos to Order, offers her tips and tricks for organizing your closet space into your own chic boutique for spring fashion. Reimagine your closet as your personal chic boutique: Before you begin to organize, make sure you have cleverly-designed products to make your closet inspiring, vibrant and fun! The new line of SOFI™ home organizational products can help you makeover your closet. SOFI products feature stylistic touches like gold fasteners and zipper accents, geometric print interiors, in a sophisticated color palette to bring you inspiration every time you open your closet door. Now, Be a Style Editor: Go through your closet item by item. Eliminate what feels drab while gathering ideas for pieces you can add to update your existing clothing collection. Group Similar Items Together: The best way to know exactly what you have is to put like-items together. Use your style editor-eye to organize by type of clothing or style and then by color. Celebrate the Season: Keep the clothes you’re currently wearing accessible so that you don’t have to waste time searching for the things you need. For quick access to clothes and accessories, use a SOFI™ Brix Box™ with pull-out handles and open tops or a SOFI™ Zipper Tote™ for quick, front-panel access to clothes and accessories. And, take advantage of floor and shelf space in your closet with a SOFI™ Stax Shelf™ that makes the most of existing vertical and horizontal space. Forget Last Season : Take time to get out-of-season clothes stored away. This will make your closet feel less cramped so you can easily see what you own before hitting the stores. Organization is not a Destination: Organization is an ongoing process that requires efficient systems, maintenance and the good old-fashioned discipline of putting things back in place. With Monica Friel’s tips, you’ll be on your way to having your own couture closet space! See my follow up before and after post of my new organized closet space using the SOFI products.

I’ve repinned a few of these images on Pinterest but unfortunately I haven’t found one with a simple step-by-step tutorial. According to braid guru Melissa Cook of Latest-Hairstyles.com , the method is pretty simple. “It’s really just a simple weaving of the hair back and forth in an over under pattern.” To master this cute and intricate 5-strand braid, just follow her simple steps below! How-to: Step 1. Begin by separating the hair into five strands. Step 2. Starting on the right side, take the two farthest strands and cross the right one over the left. Step 3. Drop the strand in your right hand and cross the one in your left hand under the next strand on the left. Step 4. Now drop the strand on the right and cross the original strand over the next one on the left. Step 5. Then drop that right strand and cross the original strand under the next one on the left. See the over, under, over method? Now begin the same steps but working in the opposite direction towards the right side. Have a friend or sibling hold your original strand, which is now the farthest left strand, to keep it out of the way. Step 6. Holding the furthest left piece out of the way, take the next two strands and cross the strand on the left under the strand on the right. Step 7. Now cross the strand in your left over over the next strand on the right. Step 8. Then cross the strand in your left under the farthest right strand. Step 9. Drop that strand (which is now the furthest strand on the right) and begin working in the opposite direction crossing the right strand under the left one next to it. Step 10. Then, cross the right strand over the next strand on the left. Step 11. Now, cross the right strand under the next strand on the left. Step 12. Continue the over, under, over weaving until you get to the bottom of the hair. Step 13. Secure the end with an elastic band. Step 14. That’s it!

This look is one of my favorite go-to hairstyles because it’s versatile (you can create numerous day and night looks) and practical. It can be done on straight, curly, wavy, or kinky hair, whether it’s for the office, a wedding or a backyard bbq party. Today we share a chic crown mesh braid tutorial done by one of my favorite youtubers, MakeupWearables Hairstyles (subscribe to her channel here ). Click play to watch the step-by-step video for this perfect warm weather hairstyle. Step 1 . Tease the back of your head and then part your hair in the front (side or center). If you have bangs, you’ll want to clip it out of the way as well. Step 2 . Make half-french braid pigtails (add in hair to bottom only). Step 3 . Half-french braid until middle of nape (make sure to fluff the braid). Step 4 . Split the braid in half to start fishtail braiding. Then tie the ends with an elastic and tug on the sides to make it bigger. Step 5 . Repeat half-french braid pigtail on the other side. Step 6 . Wrap the braid around the head. Tuck the ends inside the half-french braid & pin. Step 7 . Use a big curling iron on loose hair (bangs + baby hair). For more summer hairstyle trends, stop by our summer beauty and fashion page !

No matter what your hair type might be, you can find a great summer hair style that plays up your best features. There are so many different and new summer hairstyles you can try. See more beauty and fashion trends by checking out our Ultimate Summer Guide ! Fancy Updo Going to a formal party or a nice restaurant? Then you may want a fancy, sophisticated updo. Try a classy French twist. Simply pull your hair back into a ponytail, twist it, and tuck the ends underneath the twist. Use bobby pins to keep it in place. Pull a few wispy hair strands out to frame face, light hairspray, and you’re good to go. Casual Updo You can wear this look anywhere. Pull your hair up loosely on top of your head and keep it secure with bobby pins, or pull your hair back into a ponytail, twist it, and leave ends out for an undone look. Romantic Waves Romantic waves are back and popular than ever. Looks best on long and medium length hair. Set hair on medium sized hot rollers for long lasting curls. Don’t forget to spray on a heat protectant like Tresemme heat protectant spray before rolling hair. When rollers are dry, unroll and separate curls. If you want a more natural look, use medium and small curlers to get a variety of curls. Blunt Bangs The Blunt Bang hairstyle is in for summer. It’s a great way to bring more attention and beauty to your eyes. To intensify your eyes even more with this look, eye makeup is the key. Blunt Bangs is also a great way to help balance a slightly bigger forehead and soften facial features. Angled Bob Hairstyle Trendiest looks for summer is the angled bob hairstyle. Trendsetters like Rhianna, Katie Homes, and Victoria Beckham has made this style so popular. What’s great about this hairstyle is that it can be angled any way you would like which gives your hairstyle more options. The most popular is the classic bob where the front is longer than the back. Ponytail Ponytail is the easiest style and always a great look for summer. You get a cool hairstyle with minimal work. You can go from casual to classy with a little help of styling gel and bobby pins. A few strategically placed highlights can enhance your summer hairstyle. Straight and Sleek Use a straightening serum after shampooing your hair. Then blow dry hair with high heat using a large round brush. After blowdrying, use a flat iron to get a fabulous sleek look. Use a shine spray with sunscreen for maximum protection, beauty, and shine.

Founding Creative Director Nonie Creme is known throughout the industry for her innovative design and technique and custom blended colors that are always Fashion Week highlights. On Sunday, September 11th, Nonie and butter LONDON debuted the butter LONDON Ombre Nails look at Yigal Azrouel’s Cut25 presentation with custom mixes. Creme describes the ombré nail look: “We created bespoke mixes for the look at Yigal Azrouel’s Cut25 – Salmon Pink, 80’s Turquoise, and Pastel Pistachio. This is a butter London moment of greatness! Introducing the “ombré” manicure – softly layered, fabric woven-like nails that perfectly accent the woven jewelry here, the ultimate accessory. This is about visual texture; a loose, artistic nail art- I’m all about “fine art for nails” no palm trees or sunsets please!” For more spring runway beauty looks, check out our spring fashion guide here .

Look your best for your first day of college and beyond with ease by stocking up on all your back to school beauty essentials. From dark red lips to low-key smokey eye, you’ll have no problem deciding on what to add to your shopping list thanks to our helpful back-to-college beauty checklist.

I think we all have and it can be very frustrating especially if you just left the nail salon. Ugh! Well no more worries because I am going to show you a quick way to fix your smudged nail polish in an instant. You see the secret to preventing your nail polish from smudging is dry time and the surface usually feels dry at the touch after 10 minutes. But that’s not always the case. It can be difficult to tell when your nail polish looks dry. It may feel dry when you touch it but if you brush your fingers against something, it will still smudge. So what is a quick way to fix the smudge? Your own saliva! Here’s what you do. Lick one of your fingers (ex. your thumb) and smooth over the top of the smudged nail. Blend it in and VOILA…it’s fixed! Ok, you’re probably thinking to yourself …WTF? Trust me, it works! You see, the compounds in saliva reacts with the nail polish so with a little bit of pressure, you can soften and blend the surface. No need to apply another coat to hide it! Now your nails are smudged free and gorgeous again. I hope you enjoyed my beauty tip of the week!

Any novice nail polish collector knows there’s plenty different types of nail polish finishes out there to try and test out. Cream, matte, chrome, foil, sheer, suede… and now, thanks to cult brand Ginger + Liz, there’s also wax finish. Take yourself back to your summer camp days when you’d make candles (if you were a Girl Scout, you know what I’m sayin’) and occasionally dip your fingers in the wax. Sound weird? Well… it’s definitely “new, ” but the result is much prettier than it sounds! Somewhere between a cream finish (but much thicker) and a matte, the wax coat gives a sort of purposely unfinished effortless look that you can amp up with a top coat for a more “polished” glossy finish. So far, Ginger + Liz’s wax coat comes in Royal Flush, a deep cranberry/merlot, and Grey Area, a matte cement color that’s still totally in for the upcoming season. While the colors themselves are on the “safe” side, it may be wise to keep things simple when the innovative new finish sort of speaks for itself! – Alex Gambardella Save on Nail Color at ULTA from TheFind.com’s coupon site.

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Title":["Prettify Your Tips with Rose Gold Nail Polish!"],"url":"https://www.hotbeautyhealth.com/nails/prettify-your-tips-with-rose-gold-nail-polish/","Text":["As any beauty maven knows, nail polish trends have a ridiculously quick turnover rate — probably faster than any other fashion or beauty trend. So unless you’re obsessively on top of the color of the moment, it can be pretty tough to keep up without being slightly behind (and therefore too slow to stock up on the hottest colors)! So to avoid the frustration, sometimes it’s best to either just wing it by playing by your own style rules (if you have the cojones to rock any color of the rainbow, might as well work it!), or just stick to a universally-flattering tone that’s not a total snooze fest. After the holiday season’s obsession with glittery jewel shades and chromed-out metallics, I’m loving the second half of winter’s more versatile, day and night-friendly rose gold lacquer. It’s still gorgeously light-reflective, but a little less expected than your traditional blinged-out gold. Plus, the slight blush gives the hue more depth and flatters any skin tone for a girlie shade that shakes things up!

Now, here’s a preview of some of the looks and accessories from the Material Girl line. According to WWD , the collection will hit 200 Macy’s stores and Macys.com on August 3rd and at the end of July, Madonna will reveal the face of the Material Girl line which she personally handpicked. It is a celebrity and she’s on a hit teen drama series who’s known for her frayed, rocker-chic style. Can you guess who it is? The celebrity face of Material Girl will attend the launch of the line at Herald Square on August 3rd. Madonna described her line as : “A Material Girl is a girl that is interested in fashion and interested in music and interested in fun. [She has] a sense of humor [and] is an adventurous human being.” The collection includes: footwear, handbags, apparel, accessories and jewelry retailing between $12 to $40. There’s even special items like a trendy studded leather jacket and crinoline dress retailed up to $80. Lots of cute, trendy items. I see a few pieces I would love to have in my closet. They’ve also set up a new site and a personal blog from Lourdes Leon, Madonna’s daughter. To build up even more hype, they’ve launched a sweepstakes where you will get the chance to meet Madonna and Lourdes on the September 22nd event at Macy’s Herald Square.

First she started with New Look, then Madonna’s current fashion line Material Girl for Macy’s, and now she’s the new face of John Galliano’s new women’s fragrance, Parlez-Moi d’Amour. We just can’t get enough of this Gossip Girl starlet. Check out the Taylor Momsen Galliano ad campaign! The ad features the starlet lounging backstage. According to WWD , the ad portrays Momsen’s as a traveling rock star. Alone in Berlin, with no online communication, she has to write a love letter to her beau back at home. The concept surely ties in with the fragrance bottle (Notice the postage stamp on the side). The floral and fruity chypre scent launches in mid-October.

Step 1. Talia first applied Laura Mercier Oil-Free Day Lotion SPF 15 and Laura Mercier Foundation Primer- Hydrating to prep skin and create an even canvas for makeup application. Step 2. Next, she applied Laura Mercier Moisture Supreme Foundation all over the face, and concealed problematic areas using Laura Mercier Secret Concealer and Secret Camoflage. Step 3. Laura Mercier Tinted Moistured in SPF 20- Illuminating was applied to the forehead, nose, chin, and cheekbones to highlight the contours of the face and give the skin a natural glow. Step 4. To contour the cheekbones, Talia used Laura Mercier Bronzing Pressed Powder in Dune Bronze. She then applied Laura Mercier Gel Lip Colour to the apples of the cheeks. Eyes: Talia used various shades of blues to create flirty, “jewel-like” eyes. Step 1. Talia first gently pulled up the eyelid at the brow and applied Laura Mercier Eye Pencil in Midnight Bleu straight across the lid, starting just below the lid’s crease and extending slightly beyond the outside corner of the eye. Step2. Using the same eye pencil, she then filled in the area of the lid below the line and repeated the steps using Laura Mercier Kohl Eye Pencil in Black Turquoise. Talia gently pressed a layer of Laura Mercier Baked Eye Colour in Lagoon over the liner to set it. Step 3. With a dome-shaped brush, she then applied Laura Mercier Metallic Creme Eye Colour in Platinum from above the crease of the eye to the brow bone. Step 4. In addition, NEW Laura Mercier Artist Luxe Liquid Liner was applied to the lash line. Step 5. Talia finished the dramatic look by applying a coat of Laura Mercier Faux Lash Mascara and then applied Laura Mercier Full Faux Eyelashes. Lips: Talia layered several products to create an updated version of the “coral pastel lip that was favored by women in the ’60s.” Step 1. Talia used a lip brush to apply Laura Mercier Creme Lip Colour in Tangerine along the top and bottom lips. She then applied Laura Mercier Lip Pencil in Baby Lips Step 2. Laura Mercier Tinted Moisturizer SPF- Illuminating was applied to add dimension and shine, and the lips were set with Laura Mercier Invisible Loose Setting Powder.

It was all about brows at shows like Derek Lam . “I always love a strong architectural brow, ” said Makeup Artist Tom Pecheux. Metallic Sheen definitely caught my attention at shows such as Doo.Ri and 3.1 Phillip Lim. Shows like Fendi made the foil look fashionable. Colorful hair strands were spotted down several runway shows like Acne, Peter Som , and Thakoon. It’s one of the most bold yet rebellious spring 2012 hair trends. Wanna make a statement this spring? Make your lips do all the talking in electric shades such as bright red lips , punchy pinks, or go even bolder with blues and violets (Check out the looks backstage at Richard Chai ). Tangerine is Pantone’s Color of the year so it’s no surprise to see peach and orange tones being a major hit down the spring runways and one of the most popular spring 2012 makeup trends. The effortless ponytail is back once again in all shapes and heights. One style in particularly is the tucked ponytail look which is a fresh take on the classic chignon (See more cool ponytail ideas !). For spring, cheeks were hit with warmer tones for a “sunburnt look” at shows like DKNY . The beach season is only a few months away so adding some bronze is the perfect way to warm up.

If you’re a little wary when it comes to trying out bright beauty shades (don’t be shy, I’m with you!), but would like to be a bit more adventurous, I’ve got a color trend that’s worthy of straying from your comfort zone! Coral is the perfect summer color because it’s fun and festive. Yes, it’s bright by default, but due to the broadness of the color family, it’s practically universally flattering because it’s nearly impossible to find some form of color that doesn’t look great with your skin, from a more muted coral-pink to bold coral-tangerine. Plus, it looks great against a summer tan! If you’re ready to jump right in to the trend, Givenchy Rouge Satin Lipstick in Tempting Coral is a bit on the pricey side, but is the perfect bright, lush shade to make your pucker really pop! For a different take on the summer glow, trade your bronzer for a cheek stain like Tarte’s version in Tipsy for a sheer wash of coral! If you still think coral is a little too intense for your face, rock it on your nails (or toes!) with a coral polish like Sephora by OPI in Special Request. Whether you’re bold or color-shy with your beauty routine, you can still find a way to incorporate coral for a fresh summer look that’s never “blah!” – Alex Gambardella Save on Coral Makeup at from TheFind.com’s coupon site Share Buffer Tweet Pin +1 Stumble Yum Email Flip Shares 0"],"Date":["2010-07-09 06:26:24"],"_template":"8447-4bc9-b4df","_cached_page_id":"7b7829aabaf33577b901e09eede258bda3c9f4b9"}

The lush texture makes it easy to achieve an intense, dramatic lash look without any risk of smearing, smudging or clumping.

Refillable design makes replacing more convenient. Formulation: Ultra Black Pigments: these carbon black pigments offer an unprecedented level of intense black.

These are the purest black pigments that can be found in mascara. Volumizing, Lengthening, Curling formula: The formula plumps and thickens every lash, the stretch formula allows the mascara to lengthen even the smallest lashes and then the curling formula coats lashes in a protective film to maximise and set the curl. Artemia Salina: helps to regenerate lashes by stimulating keratin for fortification and lash growth.

I love how the natural ingredients feel on my skin, not to mention the lovely scent of the products. Until recently I stopped wearing mascara, as I was concerned about the chemicals so close to my eyes and I have very watery eyes so I need a stay-proof formula. So naturally I looked at Dr. Hauschka’s makeup collection and found he perfect solution. Dr.Hauschka Volumizing Mascara ($29.95 for 0.34 fl oz) is organic so I am not concerned about harmful chemicals and I know that the quality is high. The organic volumizing mascara adds subtle yet shimmering highlights to the lashes. The rose and candelilla waxes in the formula create a firmer, fuller volume to your lashes. The Volume Mascara dries quickly and my tiniest fine lashes are suddenly visible. Also there is no clumping or sticking. This is a fabulous organic mascara and I also love that it helps to fortify my lashes with extracts of eyebright, neem and black tea.

Why did it take so long to think up this simple-yet-genius idea? Physician’s Formula 2-in-1 Eyeliner and Lash-Boosting Serum serves as an everyday liquid liner for easy eye-defining (easy, that is, if you’re not a total klutz with liquid liner!), meanwhile targeting lashes right at the base and providing nutrients to boost thickness and growth! Unlike pricey professional lash serums, this one will only make a dent in your wallet as big as your eyeliner budget, and doesn’t come with any unsightly side effects or risks. Simply wear it like you would your normal liner — in either black, brown, plum, or clear (for those who just want the boosting properties, or just don’t have the steady hand for liquid liner) and watch your lashes grow over time as you line and define. Plus, aside from serving double-duty, it’s the perfect summer liner, as its high-tech formula also happens to be water-resistant to avoid budges or smudges through the sweat and splashes! – Alex Gambardella Guest post from my friends over at The Find!

As we switch up our winter wardrobe , it’s also time to switch up our nail color for the upcoming cold months. Here’s a few nail tips to follow when sporting the hottest winter nail polish colors: 1. The cooler weather means your nails are more at risk of breaking, so make sure to apply a daily cuticle moisturizer. 2. Keep the nail shape and length short and simple. 3. Don’t neglect your feet! Give your toes some attention by giving yourself a pedicure and add a high shine polish. The winter season best nail polish hues are dark reds, grays, and plums but it’s ok to break the rules with a punchy orange color or a soft sweet peach hue.

I also detox with fresh juices, let my skin breathe and wear a pretty ‘neutral’ shade of pink on my nails. A neutral shade of pink wears longer because it doesn’t show chips as dramatically as a dark nail color and you can do touch-ups yourself with a bit of room for mistakes since the color is sheer. I am absolutely loving Essie’s nail polish in “Mademoiselle”. It is a classic sheer shade of perfect pink. I found it at my local nail salon and loved it so much, I bought a couple bottles for my collection at home. It is also a favorite of top nail manicurists, beauty editors and celebs like Madonna and Cindy Crawford. It is also the perfect shade to get me in the mood for Valentine’s Day. Think PINK!

With a series of six creamy jewel-toned colors, Essie takes a break from its signature sheers and neon brights to embrace some gorgeous, statement-making glossy opaque shades. While a couple of the shades take inspiration from a rather literal holiday scheme (for example, the ruby red Size Matters and the minty sage green School of Hard Rocks), others opt to stay on-trend with chic takes on the latest must-have colors, like nude, navy, and lavender. And it’s hard to resist the coordinating jewelry-inspired names, like Cocktail Bling, Bobbing for Baubles, and Brooch the Subject. Doesn’t get much more adorable than that! Overall, I love the shades’ ultra-glossy finish, even without a topcoat, and the fact that they’re so creamy and opaque is definitely a selling point! What do you think – are you pleased with the brand’s holiday collection? Guest post from my friends over at The Find!

It has a thick and creamy consistency and smells amazing. I like that it has a fresh, clean scent and it lathers up quite nicely too!

You also might remember me pledging to take a 2 week challenge where I ditched my old deodorant for Dove Clear Tone to reduce the dark marks under my arms. Well, two weeks have passed and I’m ready to share my results. Here’s what Dove had to say about the deodorant: Dove® ClearTone™ Deodorant was designed to visibly reduce the appearance of dark marks under the arms and evens out skin tone caused with shaving in just 2 weeks! It’s made with Calendula and Sunflower Seed extracts, which moisturizes to help accelerate natural skin processes, helping the skin to repair itself. So you’re probably asking yourself if it solved the main problems I always encounter when shaving or buying new deodorant. Well, let’s find out! Like I mentioned in my original post, my main challenges with new deodorants include: white marks left on my clothes white flakes left underneath my arms weak odor & wetness protection First off, let me just say I was very impressed with the results. It’s not too often that you find a deodorant that can do everything. I just don’t understand why it’s so hard to find a good deodorant! Anyway, within the two week time frame, I did see some significant improvements. The dark patches caused by shaving started to go away. I’m still shocked by the results I’ve seen thus far! I’m happy, but also relieved because I no longer have to feel insecure or uncomfortable when I wear sleveless tops now. Do you understand how great of a feeling that is? The deodorant also provided all day odor & wetness protection. I tested the deodorant while getting my Zumba on and it stood up to my sweat. It also left my underarms so smooth (not one bump) and flake-free, and no white marks left on my clothes. Dove Clear Tone is hands down a winner and my new favorite deodorant! Did you know? When underarm skin is irritated by shaving, it can respond by creating dark marks. The solution – NEW Dove® Clear Tone™ Pink Rosa Deodorant. With calendula and sunflower seed extracts, Dove® Clear Tone works with your body’s natural chemistry to visibly reduce dark marks in just 2 weeks* while providing 48-hour odor and wetness protection *vs. basic deodorant roll-on without moisturizer, based on those who expressed preference in a survey Disclosure: Compensation was provided by Dove via Glam Media.

I mean who doesn’t love black? It’s chic, makes you look thinner, and you can wear it just about anywhere. But, I also like to liven up my wardrobe with a dash of color. Anyway, one of the downfalls of wearing black is accidentally getting deodorant on your clothes. I remember a time a few months back when I went on a dinner date with a guy and I wore this gorgeous black dress. I looked flawlessly, well at least I thought I did. While eating, I happen to glance over my dress and I noticed I had a few deodorant stains. This likely occurred when I was trying to squeeze into my dress. Thankfully it wasn’t too noticeable ( hopefully he didn’t notice), but I was still completely embarrassed. I went to the bathroom and tried endlessly to remove the stain. I eventually did but, now I had wet stains on my dress. I hate white mark moments! Since I started using Secret Outlast Clear Gel , I’ve been able to avoid another “white marks fail” moment. That’s why I love it! Not only does it protects from white marks, it provides 48 hour odor & wetness protection. It smells fantastic and it’s nice to know that I don’t have to worry about my odor during the hot months this summer. It has better odor protection than any other brand I have tried in the past. Check out this bad date video of a women who also had a similar incident. Tell me your “White Marks Fail” moment? If you’re not using Secret Outlast Clear Gel, you’ve likely experienced a White Marks Fail moment of your own. Tweet your #WhiteMarksFail at @SecretDeodorant and try Secret Outlast Clear Gel for 48 hour odor and wetness protection – and no white marks.

All thoughts and opinions are my own. After a long busy day, there’s nothing I would like more than to relax and freshen myself up. A wonderfully self-indulgent way I like to start my end-of-day routine is with a bath. Thanks to DOVE® Chocolate “ Unwind with Dove ” campaign, I was inspired to create this DIY spa kit. With my hectic schedule these days, a long warm bath sounds like a luxury; but I still find time to do it because I deserve it. I work hard all day so why not treat myself. This spa kit is super simple to put together and makes a great gift idea too! If it hasn’t dawned on you yet, May is a couple days away, and that means we usually start thinking about Mother’s Day gifts. This day is an important one for Moms to relax since they are the ultimate multi-taskers. With my homemade spa kit, you’ll unwind and relax with ease or have the perfect gift for anyone who would love a little pampering. Materials needed: -Various spa products – Oval wooden basket – Crinkle cut paper shreds – DOVE® Promises® chocolate I found this basket and I knew it would be perfect for the spa kit. Honestly, any container would work, if you get your creative juices flowing. After finding the perfect basket, I filled the bottom with loads of paper shreds to make a nice foundation for the products. Here are some of the things I like to add when I’m creating a spa kit: a few bath bombs, homemade bath soak, homemade sugar scrub with small scoop, scented candle, some patterned towels, a bath sponge and a few pieces of chocolate. diy bath soak I like this bath soak a lot because it’s gentle on the skin and not super bubbly. materials 1 cup of liquid castle soap 2 tbsp. of vegetable glycerin 4 tsp. of white sugar 15 drops of essential oil (I used lavender oil) 8 oz. container instructions Step 1. Combine everything in a small bowl and mix well. Step 2. Transfer liquid to your container with lid. Step 3. Let it sit for 24 hours before using. Step 4. When ready to use, pour under running bathwater. Note: You should keep it for 2 – 3 months in a dark, cool place. diy sugar scrub This sugar scrub gently exfoliate dead skin cells leaving skin soft and smooth. materials 1 cup of white sugar 1 cup of brown sugar 1/2 cup of coconut oil (Can use olive oil instead) 5 drops of essential oil ( I used lavender oil) 4 oz jar instructions Step 1. Combine everything in a small bowl and mix well. Step 2. Transfer to your jar. Note: You can make adjustments to any ratio depending on your skin texture or fragrance preferences. So if you have tougher skin, use coarse sugar and for sensitive skin use granulated sugar. After making the bath products, I used a label maker to label them. One of the most important elements to a good bath is having the proper snacks on hand. I like a snack that I can nibble slowly as I soak my cares away. I think of things that take a bit of chewing like small candies or maybe a few pieces of fine chocolate that would melt in my mouth one bite at a time like DOVE® Promises® chocolate. All I need is 2 or 3 pieces and I’m happy. Each piece of chocolate, has a message featured on the inside of DOVE® Promises® chocolate wrapper to help you relax and unwind. I love this idea as I think it’s nice to read some soothing words as I unwind and de-stress. I hope you were inspired by this DIY Spa Kit.

Keep your skin glowing all year long especially during the winter months by learning how to keep your skin looking fresh. Here are 8 beauty tips for glowing skin ! Cleanse and Exfoliate Skin Get glowing skin by using a mild and gentle cleanser (Cetaphil $7). Exfoliate with a facial scrub like St. Ives Apricot Scrub ($4). Banish Breakouts Fight off acne with a facial cleanser and acne spot treatment. More importantly, try and keep your skin calm by controlling your stress. I like to apply a facial mask twice a week to keep me in a “zen-like” mood. Your skin will be glowing in no time. Wear Sunscreen The best way to keep your skin looking youthful is by pouring on the sunscreen. You should wear sunscreen year round and look for one with SPF15 or higher. Since sunscreen stops working after 3 hours, an easier solution is to use a powder sunscreen . It’s great for touchups and it’s light so your makeup stays on. Drink Tea Research shows that drinking green or black tea at least three times a day can safeguard your skin. Tea contains compounds like theaflavins and ECGG which helps protect against skin cancers and the breakdown of collagen aka wrinkles. Sun-kissed Skin Having a sun-kissed glow gives a more youthful appearance. Adding a little tint can give your skin a more even tone look. “A little tint takes years off your face by evening out your skin tone, ” says Ranella Hirsch, M.D., a dermatologist in Cambridge, MA. Olay Complete Touch of Sun Daily UV Moisturizer + A Touch of Sunless Tanner ($15) should do the trick. Tone and Tighten Witch hazel or a toner can help tighten and tone your skin. It doesn’t irritate the skin and it promotes fast healing. Another cool tip is exercising your facial muscles. “I am religious about strength-training, and I always tell patients to do it more as they get older, ” says Patricia Farris, M.D., a dermatologist in Metairie, LA. It’s a great way to obtain firm and plump skin. Superfoods for Skin Eat foods rich in antioxidants and essential fatty acids. Foods with high antioxidants: blueberries, strawberries, blackberries, black and pinto beans, pecans, and artichokes. Foods high in essential fatty acids (EFA’s): halibut, almonds, nuts, flax seed, olive and canola oil. Selenium is a trace mineral that plays an important role in skin cell health too. To grab a good amount of selenium, eat whole grains, cereal, tuna, muffins, and turkey. Hydrate Skin Drink water everyday !! You know it’s good for you.

{"_type":"Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care","Title":["3 Ways to Enhance Your Summer Glow"],"url":"https://www.hotbeautyhealth.com/summer/3-ways-to-enhance-your-summer-glow/","Text":["During the summer, we all want to achieve a healthy summer glow . Most people like to lay out under the sun all day or head to a tanning bed salon. Summer is the best time to capitalize on achieving a sun-kissed glow, but if you’re not to keen on the idea of going outside because you fear burning or are allergic to most sunscreens, then an at home solution is the best alternative. Here are some ways you can enhance your summer glowing skin without the sun. How to Get a Summer Glow: Self-Tanning Lotion These self tanning lotions are incredibly effective nowadays especially after considerable research done on the products. You can find a variety of good brands at stores that will give you that nice healthy glow. Try asking around or even reading reviews to find the best self tanning lotion being sold in the market today. Suggestions: Tan Towel Classic Self-Tan Towlette , $10; St. Tropez Self-Tan Bronzing Mousse , $32 Bronzer Applying a facial bronzer is the most common and effective method to warm up your complexion. Look for a tanning bronzer that is around two shades deeper than your skin tone. You’ll start to see great results as the skin begins to look like it literally gloried under the sun for some time. Suggestions: Urban Decay Baked Bronzer (Discontinued but here’s an alternative ), $26; Stila One Step Bronze Skin Tone Illuminating Bronzing Serum , $36 Exfoliant and Moisturizer Products One of the top reasons why people have horrible skin during the summer is because of dryness. Since the sun is hitting your skin for longer periods of time, it starts to lose water, causing it to look and feel cracked and rough. So, exfoliating your skin with a body scrub is a must to remove the dead skin away. Additionally, using a moisturizer would help bring back the water originally lost by the summer heat. Suggestions: Kiehl’s Body Scrub , $28; Caudalie Merlot Friction Scrub (discontinued, but here’s an alternative ), $29 Keep in mind that places like the neck, ears, and hands should also get the same level of attention as the face. It’s very easy to forget these areas. For year-round healthy skin, keep in mind that diet plays a big factor. Make sure to eat more fruits and vegetables because like the saying goes… you are what you eat.

Truth is, skincare products are often times not enough. Here, I’ve put together 35 natural skincare tips for overall skin health. By using natural skincare solutions, your skin will show a dramatic improvement overtime. 1. Drink More Water Your body is made up of 60% water. It’s necessary to drink water daily. Water hydrates the skin which in turn makes it healthy and beautiful . 2. Take in More Antioxidants Antioxidants are great at protecting your skin cells from free radical damage. It helps keep your skin glowing and youthful. Fruits and vegetables are full of antioxidants- Blueberries, raspberries, dark leafy green vegetables, and citrus fruits. 3. Exercise Exercising can have a huge impact on your complexion. Doing 30 minutes/day of walking, running, swimming, bicycling, yoga , or any kind of active movements will be great for your skin tone and texture. 4. Breathe more Deeply This can reduce stress and you’ll feel more calm and at peace. Breathe deeply while you’re reading this post! 5. Reduce Alcohol Intake Alcohol is a diuretic which can cause dehydration. This is the last thing you want for your skin!. 6. Lay off the Caffeine For all you coffee lovers out there, caffeine is another diuretic which can lead to dry skin and lack of nutrients. Try and limit your coffee drinking. 7. Have Some Good Fats The body can’t live without good fats aka Essential Fatty Acids. It’s particularly important for people who have skin conditions such as acne, eczema, and severe dry skin. Flaxseed oil and fish are full of this stuff. Make sure to include this in your diet. READ: 5 Surprising Fatty Foods That Can Trim Your Waistline 8. Take some MSM I take this daily I can’t tell you how great my skin looks. MSM is a sulfur compound that is known to heal skin problems like scars and wrinkles. I take MSM supplements daily ( Grab it here on Amazon ) but it’s better to consume raw vegetables. It has to be raw because food processing removes it. 9. Vitamins Take plenty of vitamins for healthy skin. A couple of good vitamins are: Vitamin E which heals wounds and scars; Vitamin A stimulates cell production and restores pigmentation and Vitamin B complex helps clear up acne. READ: Do Vitamins Work or Are You Just Wasting Your Time? 10. Manage your Stress! To have healthy skin, you gotta have a healthy state of mind. Stress can cause more problems for your skin so try and manage your stress by doing things you enjoy or love. 11. Charge up on Superfoods! Oh yes, superfoods are awesome! They are full of phytonutrients and does wonders to your skin. Check out my previous post on Superfoods . 12. Massage Get a massage can be very relaxing but it’s also great for the skin. Massage helps with the skin’s circulation and reducing stress. Make your next appointment at a massage parlor. 13. Balance Hormones A few common signs of hormonal imbalance are acne, oily skin, fatigue, and weight gain. This can be a serious condition so its always best to talk to your doctor. A natural way to balance your hormones is through supplements and changing your eating habits. 14. Regular Cleansing Routine Keep your face radiant by having a regular skincare routine. Stick to a skincare regimen using organic products that’s right for your skin. Lately I’ve been into natural Korean beauty products and they have done wonders to my skin. READ: My 10 Step Korean Skincare Routine 15. Moisturize If you want your skin to stay glowing, plump, and healthy, then moisturizing is key. Many skincare products have harmful ingredients so look for natural/organic skincare products that are of high quality. Great places to find them are at whole food stores or vitamin shops. 16. Get Some Sun With summer approaching it’s okay to get some sun. In fact, it’s necessary. Your body needs the sun for the production of Vitamin D. There are a lot of people out there who are Vitamin D deficient and at one point I was and I didn’t even realize. So, enjoying 15 or 20 minutes of sun exposure couldn’t hurt. 17. Stay out of the Sun This might sound hypocritical since the previous tip suggested some sun; however monitoring sun exposure is also necessary. A lifetime of sun exposure can lead to dry skin, wrinkles, age spots, freckles, sunburns, or even worse..skin cancer. So try to avoid the sun when the sun rays are the strongest which is usually between 10am to 4 pm. Wear protective clothing and sunscreen too! READ: 8 Popular Sunburn Cures & Remedies That Work Well 18. Juicing A simple way to get more nutrients into your body is by doing a juice cleanse . Get a juicer to make all kinds of drinks with fruits and vegetables. The nutrients will protect the skin from aging and provide plenty of antioxidants. 19. Go organic Organic foods are so much better than non-organic items. Yes it cost a little more dough but I consider that better than grabbing foods that contain pesticides. 20. Don’t smoke If you don’t wrinkles then put the cigarette down. Smoking can deplete the skin of its nutrients such as Vitamin A. It can also damage elastin and collagen which gives the skin its elasticity. 21. Good Digestive System To have good skin you gotta have a good digestive system. The main causes of a bad digestive system is not drinking enough water and not consuming more fiber. If you don’t want to suffer from acne, psoriasis or constipations, get your digestive tract right on track. 22. Get your Beauty rest Try and get at least 8 hours of sleep a day. Lack of beauty sleep can cause hormonal imbalance and accelerate the aging process. 23. Organic Clay Mask Applying a clay mask once or twice a week is great for cleansing the skin. Mask draws out impurities and reduces acne. You’ll be left with soft and clean skin. 24. Keep it moving The best solution for overall skin health… Keep it moving . Invigorate your circulation by taking a quick walk outside, going to the gym, doing some stretching, and etc. Doing nothing can promote acne, loss of muscle tone, and cellulite. Yikes! 25. Reduce Sugar Intake Sugar is one of the causes of aging prematurely. It damages the collagen in the skin and reduces elasticity. Try and reduce your sugar intake. I know it can be difficult but it can be a gradual process. 26. Meditation Mediation is known to reduce stress and keep you calm. It increases your health and improves your skin. 27. Stay away from Synthetic Chemicals Synthetic chemicals are harsh for the skin and can do more damage than good. You can find all kinds of ingredients in skin care products that are chemically based which isn’t a good thing. It’s better to go all natural . 28. Eat More Whole Foods Whole foods have more vitamins, minerals, antioxidants and nutrients that the body needs. Stay away from refined sugars! 29. Include Fermented Foods They keep your stomach happy by improving digestion, absorption and nutrient intakes. Examples of fermented foods are sourdough bread, salsa, ketchup, Kefir, and sour cream. 30. Try Aloe Vera Aloe vera naturally heals the skin. Check out my post on the benefits of aloe vera ! 31. Homemade beauty recipes Create your own beauty recipes with all natural ingredients. Here’s a couple of homemade beauty recipes to start off with. 32. Exfoliate Exfoliation gets rid of dead skin cells and allows the skin to detox. It also brightens and softens the skin . Go for all-natural scrubs! 33. Try a Natural Astringent A natural astringent like rose water and witch hazel is great for removing excess oil, reducing pore size and increasing blood circulation. Astringents found at stores can be really harsh on the skin and can cause more oil production. I like to make my own astringent at home using lemon juice, cucumber juice, and honey. 34. Good Hygiene This is very important for a healthy body. You can prevent many infections with a good anti-bacterial soap. 35. Be Good to your skin Take care of your skin daily and enjoy the benefits of natural skincare.

Since people have different skin types, it’s not surprising that there are those who find themselves responding negatively to various products. Unfortunately, there is not a simple solution to finding a sunscreen other than applying it to your the skin. Yes, it’s basically trial and error but, it’s the best system to prevent breakouts and protect your skin from summer rays . For those bent on finding that perfect sunscreen for your acne prone skin, read our tips below. Oily Skin People with oily skin should opt for a sunscreen that’s combined with powder. One that can absorb the oil even while protecting the skin from the harsh rays of the sun. Suggestion: Peter Thomas Roth: Instant Mineral Powder SPF 45 , $30 Dry Skin Look for emollient moisturizers like glycerin and aloe if you have dry or very dry skin. Suggestion: La Roche-Posay Anthelios SX Daily Moisturizer , $29 Sensitive Skin Those with skin prone to reddening or even pimples should opt for a gentler sunscreen.
