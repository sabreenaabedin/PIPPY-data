But the reason why your skin isn‚Äôt slaying could simply be because you‚Äôre applying your creams in the wrong order. We know it seems crazy militant, but if you don‚Äôt apply your lotions and potions in a specific order, you‚Äôre seriously disenabling them from doing their job. The most important thing is to ensure your skin is completely clean before you apply any hydrating lotions or oils. The general rule is to apply the most lightweight formulas first so they can be easily absorbed without the barrier of heavier creams. After each layer, give your skin time to absorb the product (at least a few minutes), this will also mean when you‚Äôre layering your products they won‚Äôt pill ‚Äì those tiny little balls you get when you‚Äôve used too much product. Here‚Äôs how to layer products like a pro: 1) Cleanser: Cleansing should remove any makeup or dirt from your skin while also adding a burst of hydration, and if you wear makeup, you should definitely be double cleansing. To double cleanse, start with a cleansing oil (the most nourishing way to remove any makeup as they‚Äôre free from harsh chemicals, soaps, and parabens), then use a foam or gel cleanser (or whichever best suits your skin type ). It sounds extra, but it will make sure there‚Äôs absolutely no makeup or dirt on your skin before you continue the rest of your regime. 2) Toner: Toning is super important as it removes any grime that your cleanser wouldn‚Äôt budge, and any minerals or chlorines from your water. It will also instantly tighten your pores and help restore your skin‚Äôs pH levels for a more even skin tone. For more guidance on choosing the right toner for your skin type, check out our toner guide here . 3) Spot Treatment: If you‚Äôre prone to pimples, apply your cream now so it can absorb properly and start working its magic. 4) Serum: Serums are lightweight and contain a high concentration of active ingredient. The formula is made up of smaller molecules that are absorbed into the skin at a much deeper level. This makes serums ideal if you‚Äôre trying to target a specific skincare issue, like wrinkles or dry skin, as many are packed with hydrating ingredients as well. Like essences, which are basically a more watery version of serums, you only need a small amount ‚Äì about the size of 2 pomegranate seeds! 5) Eye cream: Eye creams can brighten under eyes, reduce any inflammation, and add an extra hit of moisture. Depending on the formula it may look like a serum or a thick moisturizer, but now is the time to apply it. This way it has fewer barriers to get through and can be absorbed more easily! Always apply your eye cream with your fourth finger in a tapping motion, as this is the weakest finger so you won‚Äôt tug or pull the delicate skin. We also love to keep our eye cream in the fridge; it‚Äôs the ultimate eye wake-up call in the mornings! 6) Moisturizer: Hydrated skin is glowing skin, so NEVER skip your moisturizer. The right moisturizer will hydrate, replenish, restore your skin‚Äôs pH levels, and nourish and repair any issues like dry, flaky skin. But it‚Äôs also essential that you choose one with the right formula and ingredient list for your skin type. Like if you have dry skin, you need a really rich formula, but if you have acne-prone or oily skin, a gel formula will be your best friend. For our top tips on how to choose the right one, read our moisturizer guide . How much product you should actually be using: 7) Face Oil: Without a doubt one of the most powerful potions on your shelf, the small molecular structure of face oils allows them to penetrate deeper into your skin and hydrate at a much deeper level. They also repair and plump your skin, and feed it with amazing natural vitamins. If you‚Äôre on the oily skin list, we recommend only using your face oil at night. For our guide on how to pick the right oil, click here . We like The Ordinary‚Äôs Granactive Retinoid 5% in Squalane ‚Äì it combines an amazing natural oil (squalane) and a form of retinol, which is the ultimate anti-aging ingredient. 8) SPF: For daytime, this is THE most important step, even during the winter months. Applying a good sunscreen every morning will protect your skin from damaging UVA and UVB rays. An SPF will sit on the surface of your skin acting as a protective barrier against the sun, so you should always apply it last; otherwise, it could stop your other products from penetrating.

Sure, now and again it‚Äôs no harm, but no matter how much money you spend on miracle products, if you‚Äôre not taking care of what you put into your body, your newest potion is never going to reach its full potential. These five superfoods, however, will make you feel beautiful from the inside out and we swear in just a week, we‚Äôve been able to notice a difference in our hair and our skin. Plus, by eating healthily you‚Äôll have more than just extra energy and great hair, your concentration and mood will improve too. These five ingredients are so good you‚Äôll want to bathe in them ‚Äì and btw, we have the recipes so that you can: Chia Seeds ‚Äì The Glow-Getter Don‚Äôt be fooled by their size, these tiny seeds are literally full of beauty-boosting minerals and antioxidants. They‚Äôre super high in Omega 3, so they‚Äôll give you the ultimate glow while reducing any inflammation or dryness. The amazing seeds also increase your blood circulation, thereby giving you more even skin. You can sprinkle the seeds on pretty much anything, from your yogurts and smoothies to your salads. We love mixing them with almond milk and honey for a delicious breakfast snack with fruit. Chia Seed and Lavender Face Mask DIY: Our favorite Chia Seed DIY will gently exfoliate your skin leaving you feeling baby soft with a J Lo glow. Mix 2 teaspoons of Chia Seeds with 4 tablespoons of water, then add 2 drops of lavender oil. Massage it onto your face and leave the mix on your skin for 10 minutes, then just wash away with warm water. Medjool Dates ‚Äì Acne Banisher, Youth Booster In Dubai, Medjool Dates are literally everywhere ‚Äì we‚Äôre obsessed! But, not just because they‚Äôre mega tasty, they‚Äôre also a rich source of fiber, which will support your metabolism and help you debloat. In the Middle East, we like to use them to break our fast during Ramadan, as they‚Äôre great energy boosters ‚Äì making them an ideal snack (just stick to a few though as they‚Äôre high in sugar). Medjool Dates are also a great source of copper, which helps your body absorb more iron allowing your skin to produce more collagen. Dates can even help reduce redness and will work as an anti-inflammatory, so if you‚Äôre acne-prone, ditch the crisps and grab a date! Medjool Date and Honey Mask DIY: De-pit 3 to 4 dates and blend with 1 to 2 teaspoons of honey (both rich in vitamin B) to formulate a thick paste. Spread this mix on your face and leave for 10 minutes before washing away with water. Your face will feel SO smooth. Avocado ‚Äì The Hair Helper Avocados aren‚Äôt just for your breakfast Insta snap, they‚Äôre a beauty miracle ingredient too! Avocados are full of fatty acids and proteins, and whether you use them on your hair as a mask or you just eat them on toast, they‚Äôll give your locks killer shine ‚Äì Adriana Lima swears by it. The vitamin B and E content will also strengthen your hair follicles and help the strands remain strong and healthy, preventing split ends from forming. Avocado and Coconut Hair Mask For the ultimate hair mask, mash one ripe avocado (if you have shorter hair you can use half and eat the other), and mix it with one egg yolk and two tablespoons of coconut oil. Massage it into your hair (from root to tip) and then wash it off 20 minutes later. Just make sure you shampoo your hair thoroughly or you could get a little oily at the roots. Lemons ‚Äì The Detox Queen Whenever you ask a model how they start their day, we swear the answer will be with a cup of hot water and lemon. Lemon is an incredible detoxifier and cleans your digestive system so that your liver can eliminate waste more efficiently. It also boosts your lymphatic drainage, which will help get rid of any puffiness around your eyes and toxins from your body. And the best thing about a detox drink is that it can seriously help clear up your skin, so say hello to that glow! Lemon, Honey, and Green Tea Face Mask This face mask will revitalize your skin and cleanse your pores, leaving your skin super radiant. Mix the juice of half a lemon with 1 teaspoon of honey and the contents of one green tea bag (brew the tea first, and then take the leaves from the tea bag). Apply it your face and wash it off 15 minutes later with warm water. Figs ‚Äì The Beauty All-rounder Figs don‚Äôt get the hype they deserve but we love them! Just like lemons, they‚Äôre an incredible detoxifier as the seeds inside the fruit will help cleanse the digestive tract of mucus and toxins. This is so important as when it‚Äôs blocked, it prevents essential nutrients getting into your skin. It‚Äôs also full of antioxidants that help fight free radicals, which cause fine lines and wrinkles to form. A great source of vitamins C and B6, figs can help even out your skin tone and regulate hormone activity, combatting breakouts. We love to snack on them throughout the day, but make sure you limit your intake to just a couple as they‚Äôre high in sugar. Fig and Oatmeal Mask For an amazing exfoliator, we like to blend 5 figs with a teaspoon of powdered oatmeal and a teaspoon of milk. Once a smooth paste is formed, massage it into your skin, leave it for 15 minutes and wash it off with warm water and a soft washcloth.

Not only are you trying to find your unique shade, the ideal coverage for your complexion, a formula that won‚Äôt break you out, but one that will last you through every moment of your hectic day without looking cakey ‚Äì mission impossible? Oh, and add to that you also don‚Äôt want to spend a fortune, because let‚Äôs be real, we have an arm‚Äôs length list of beauty products we also need to shop for! This is especially important because with every new season, my skincare and foundation routine changes to adapt to whatever the climate throws at me. During the summer months, I prefer to wear a lightweight foundation formula, and my long-term FAV has to be Maybelline‚Äôs Fit Me Foundation ‚Äì it costs $8, or less depending on the store. Maybelline has just expanded the range with a new matte formula to suit more skin tones, and it‚Äôs perfect for controlling oily skin, especially during the summer months. I absolutely LOVE the original Dewy and Smooth formula for summer (I use shade 220). It‚Äôs one of those foundations I reach for when I‚Äôm having a ‚Äògood skin day‚Äô because it gives THE most gorgeous natural finish. If you love a no makeup-makeup look, then you‚Äôll adore this. It can easily be built for concentrated coverage, and it has a glowy, dewy finish. Because it‚Äôs summer (or if you have oily skin), I recommend setting this with a dusting of translucent powder. My tip is to use a damp beautyblender to gently bounce loose powder onto your skin; it gives seamless coverage that isn‚Äôt heavy or cakey ‚Äì just tap off the extra powder before application, as makeup sponges pick up a ton of product. (And make sure your beauty blender is clean! See why here) . Finally, the only issue with the Dewy and Smooth range is they only offer 16 shades, and only two of those are tailored for deeper skin tones. The newest addition, Matte and Poreless , is a much more full-coverage foundation, which is great for immediate coverage that can be effortlessly applied. This is also a good option if you have oily skin or acne, as it‚Äôs an oil-free formula which has micro-powders that absorb oil and help to blur pores. I‚Äôm also super impressed with the new matte formula, which offers 32 shades and a really good selection of colors for all skin tones. amazing foundation drugstore foundation fit me foundation Sun, 16 Jul 2017 9 Comments Related Posts Is This New Drugstore Foundation A Dupe For Our‚Ä¶ Tue, 23 Jan 2018 Did Tarte Just Create The Most Ahhhhmazing Foundation Stick?

I often get pimples on my shoulders, and I‚Äôve found a product that makes targeting and banishing the annoying spots so easy. But don‚Äôt get body acne confused with those annoying tiny bumps on your arms, that‚Äôs called keratosis pilaris, and it needs to be treated very differently ‚Äì check out our blog post on how you can control that here . If you‚Äôre here for acne, I swear by the Murad Clarifying Body Spray ‚Äì it made a huge difference to my problem areas in a week! What it is: An acne treatment in a spray bottle specifically designed for your body, which diminishes the ongoing acne cycle. What it does: The formula uses salicylic acid to penetrate and clean deep into pores, speeding up the disappearing process and preventing new acne from forming. It contains niacinamide to minimize oil production, and blue lotus flower to purify pores. Finally, menthol cools the skin and reduces irritation to soothe your skin. Why we love it: The Murad Clarifying Body Spray is amazing for getting rid of buttne , bacne, chestne or anywhere else you‚Äôre getting annoying pimples on your body. I use this after the shower to prevent breakouts, or if I have a breakout, I‚Äôll use this twice a day. It‚Äôs really convenient and super easy to use; because it‚Äôs in a spray bottle, it means you can target areas on your back that you might not be able to reach yourself with a cream or body wash, (you can even spray it upside down to get your buttne). It also means you don‚Äôt need to worry about washing your hands after you‚Äôve applied it, so this is great if you‚Äôre on the go, traveling or just in a hurry. Make sure you avoid using it on your face, where your skin is more sensitive. My top tips: If you‚Äôre suffering with body acne in the long term, I also really recommend using the Bioderma Atoderm Shower Gel , which is less pricey and really great for your skin and body acne. Even though the Murad Clarifying Spray is quite expensive, it lasts a really long time, and because it works so well, you‚Äôll use it less and less. Also make sure if you exercise regularly to try and wear ‚Äòsweat-wicking‚Äô fabrics that move the moisture away from your skin, and shower as quickly as possible afterward.

But, whether you‚Äôre gearing up to jet somewhere warm for a winter vacation (lucky!) or just trying to keep up with all the beauty maintenance that can seem like a full-time job, a smooth and groomed bikini line is big must in our book. Since everyone has her own preference for hair removal techniques ‚Äì whether it‚Äôs shaving, waxing, laser, or hair removal creams ‚Äì we tapped dermatologist Dr. Cindy Yoon-Soo Bae of the Laser Skin Surgery Center in New York for some tips on staying bikini-ready all year round. Shaving Not ready to invest a ton of time (or money) on your hooha? We got you. If you‚Äôre all about that shave, Dr. Bae recommends using a single-blade razor ‚Äì and replacing it frequently ‚Äì then when you‚Äôre about 5-10 minutes into your shower, using good skincare products to help the blade glide (we‚Äôre still a big fan of this Lush Shaving Soap , FYI). ‚ÄúThis will ensure your hair and skin is sufficiently softened for an easier shave. And remember that when you‚Äôre shaving, you‚Äôre also exfoliating the skin in the area, so if you have a spray tan it will cause streaking,‚Äù says Dr. Bae. Waxing While it can be painful (no pain, no gain!), waxing is a good option that keeps you feeling smooth for a bit longer than a shave, and it‚Äôs not a huge splurge ‚Äì typically a bikini wax starts at around $30, depending on where you go. Of course, if you‚Äôre brave enough you can DIY it ‚Äì we like the Veet wax strips for their effectiveness and drugstore price. The reason it lasts longer is because rather than shaving, where you‚Äôre merely cutting off the hair at the skin‚Äôs surface, waxing is pulling the hair from the root where growth starts. In order to grab the hair, it‚Äôs best to wait until your grow-out is about ¬º an inch so the wax can really adhere to the hairs. And be careful about making an appointment around your time of the month, since your skin (along with your mood) is generally more sensitive then. Laser Laser hair removal is definitely an investment (it can set you back upwards of $200 per appointment and at least six sessions are recommended to see results), but if you‚Äôre really looking to get to the root of the problem ‚Äì literally ‚Äì it can be a cost-effective way to permanently preen your bikini area once and for all. The laser, in essence, penetrates skin to kill the hair follicle, leaving hair to gradually fall out from the treated area within weeks. If you‚Äôre thinking about trying laser hair removal around your bikini area, it‚Äôs important to prep for your appointment by shaving beforehand and not waxing. ‚ÄúThe way that the laser works is that it needs to find a focus point ‚Äì the hair follicles need to be in place for the laser to target and therefore be effective,‚Äù says Dr. Bae. And because the laser also targets pigment in skin, spray and sun tans should be avoided prior to your appointment. Laser works best on dark hairs, which can absorb the heat from the laser more effectively, and even better on dark hairs and fairer skin. Hair Removal Creams Though not as popular (partially due to the strong odor a lot of them have), hair removal creams are a quick, painless, and affordable way to de-fuzz fast. Similar to shaving, this method merely removes hair from the skin‚Äôs surface, but rather than using a blade, hair removal creams use chemicals to break down the hair follicle so that hair can be wiped away. Be sure to use a formula that is specific for the body part you are targeting, and do a patch test if you have sensitive skin to prevent a reaction. We recommend hair removal creams more for your legs and armpits than your sensitive bikini line. How to deal with ingrown hairs: No matter what method of hair removal you choose, ingrown hairs are bound to pop up along the way. Dr. Bae advises that you ‚Äúdon‚Äôt pick at an ingrown hair as there is a risk that it can lead to scarring. You can try warm compresses, gentle exfoliation, or even topical acne medicine like your salicylic acid spot treatment to try to clear it up fast.‚Äù If the irritation is less concentrated to a single spot and you‚Äôre concerned it could be a rash or reaction Dr. Bae suggests ‚Äúyou should see a physician or dermatologist for a proper diagnosis and treatment since it could be anything from folliculitis (infected hair follicles) to something more serious if you‚Äôve been using razors that have been sitting around.‚Äù Otherwise, an over-the-counter topical steroid can be used for a limited time and applying witch hazel (like Dickinson‚Äôs Witch Hazel ), can help with the redness due to its astringent properties.

The FDA released the following statement in March 2004 to further emphasize the benefits of walnuts: ‚ÄúSupportive but not conclusive research shows that eating 1.5 oz of walnuts per day, as part of a low saturated fat and low cholesterol diet, and not resulting in increased caloric intake may reduce the risk of coronary heart disease.‚Äù Check out these recipes for ways to eat to a more beautiful you!

But, you shouldn‚Äôt limit your intake of nutmeg to the holiday period, it actually has some major health benefits. The best thing is you probably have it in your kitchen, and if you don‚Äôt, you can get it for less than $5! Naturally harvested from evergreen trees, this festive spice is bursting with goodness that will nourish, repair, and boost pretty much everything; from clearing your skin to fixing bad breath. Here‚Äôs how: For your skin : The next time you have a breakout, don‚Äôt grab the toothpaste ( find out why) instead get some nutmeg powder and make a mask. Not only does it have anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties that will help reduce redness and swelling, but the grainy texture of the powder will also work as a gentle exfoliator. For mature skin: Nutmeg is a great anti-aging ingredient as it contains antioxidants that help fight off free radicals , which cause premature aging. These stimulating properties will also activate your dead skin cells and boost renewal and growth, reducing fine lines and wrinkles. For hair: Nutmeg oil can do absolute wonders for your hair health, it‚Äôll promote hair growth and add a killer shine. It‚Äôll also tone your hair and increase blood circulation getting rid of any flaky skin. You can add one or two drops to your conditioner and rinse as usual. For oral hygiene: Look for herbal toothpaste that contains nutmeg. Due to the many antibacterial components, it‚Äôll combat bad breath by killing bacteria in your mouth. This‚Äôll help build up your mouth‚Äôs immunity to bacteria so you can say goodbye to bad breath in the long run. For weight loss: Even when a whole nutmeg has been ground into a powder, it still retains its crazy high fiber content, which will instantly boost your bowel movement ‚Äì nasty we know, but also seriously helpful for weight loss. Plus, it‚Äôll naturally ease digestion by stimulating gastric juices that break down food. You can add a little nutmeg powder into your breakfast meal: sprinkle it on top of pancakes, oats, or cereals, or add a pinch to your smoothie. Acne Miracle Mask DIY Not only will the nutmeg work wonders, but combined with honey to heal, and milk to gently exfoliate your skin, this mask is ahhhhmazing for acne. Mix 2 tablespoons of honey, with one teaspoon of nutmeg, and one tablespoon of milk in a bowl. Stir until the mixture is well combined and then apply to your skin with a synthetic makeup brush and work outwards. Let the mask sit for 10-15 minutes before rinsing.

I ended up with craters all over my face at the worst of moments, right before my beau would come into town, the day before a photo shoot, the night before my best friend who I hadn‚Äôt seen in a year would visit! Yes, I know, acne is evil! After trying every beauty product in Sephora, Aveda, Lush and the like, I thought my only option would be something severe like Acutane. Enter Ole Henriksen. As a young boy Henrikson studied natural remedies in countries from Indonesia to London to understand their reaction with skin. Some odd years later and he is now the preferred brand of A-listers including Naomi Campbell, Charlize Theron, and Linda Evangelista. What it did for me, made my skin more even toned, tighter, and brighter. Ever since using this product, I am constantly asked what is my secret to beautiful skin. My secret? Good product! Looks like I may be lucky after all! Products I use and highly recommend from Ole Henrikson: THREE LITTLE WONDERS (great value $70) THE BEST FOR SKIN REPAIR Blemish Control Roll-On Attack ($22) My cure-all for breakouts! Award winning, Mini Peel system ($95) My life-saver!

You can use amazing foundations and the best primers, but ultimately without the right setting powder, your look just isn‚Äôt going to last. A setting powder is crucial to keeping your makeup locked in and matte, and the best powders will even blur imperfections and color correct problem areas. So, as you‚Äôre always asking us which is the best setting powder to use, we compared the top 5 industry favs so you can find the best setting powder for your skin type, tone, and budget. We analyzed Ben Nye‚Äôs iconic Banana Powder, Industry fav the Laura Mercier Translucent Setting Powder, Kat Von D‚Äôs Lock-It Brightening Powders, the Tarte Rain Forest Of The Sea Filtered Light Setting Powder, and the illustrious Givenchy Prisme Libre Loose Powder. Here‚Äôs our verdict‚Ä¶ Ben Nye is an excellent all-round setting powder, it‚Äôs affordable and gives great results for all skin tones. Laura Mercier is another powder that will work for almost anyone, plus it‚Äôs really reasonably priced. Kat Von D takes the crown for best for oily-skin, while Givenchy is our go-to for dry and normal skin types, although it is a little pricey. Tarte is a great daytime powder that will keep you matte all day and perfect your skin. See the full deets on each powder below. Ben Nye Banana Powder This powder became super famous because tons of Hollywood celebs used this to keep their under eyes baked to perfection all day. It was the first time a powder used a color like yellow, and as much as it was pigmented and beautifully brightening, the formula itself was amazing: It was professional makeup that catered to everyone, which is why is stuck around! Not only does it look great in photos, the yellow tinge balances out blue under-eye circles, while it also sets your under-eye area for a crease-free finish all day. The formula became famous for the yellow powder, but ultimately this works best for light/medium to golden skin tones, as it corrects surface redness and pink undertones. The good news is that they now have six color-correcting shades so that everyone can take advantage of the incredible formula. Available: CameraReadyCosmetics.com Price: $16.50 Laura Mercier Translucent Setting Powder We LOVE this super natural-looking powder, and Laura Mercier did such a good job creating a simple-to-use powder that works for everyone. It‚Äôs kind of iconic in the beauty industry, it‚Äôs like the powder that made translucent setting powder a thing because almost everyone uses it, and it‚Äôs available almost everywhere. The powder has two shades, a translucent shade for fair-to-tan complexions and a deep translucent shade that works for darker skin tones. We also love that you can get it in small sizes too, which is great for when you‚Äôre traveling or just want to test it out without investing ‚Äì that said, it‚Äôs actually the second-best value for money in our powder-off, after Ben Nye. Available: Sephora.com Price: $38 Kat Von D Lock-It Brightening Powder This powder is actually designed to be used under the eye for baking and brightening the eye area, but it honestly works incredibly all over, especially if you have oily skin! Kat Von D has done such a great job with the three shades, and there‚Äôs definitely one for every skin tone, but I wish they had an even bigger selection. The three shades are Petal, a pale pink that works to brighten fair complexions, Peach, for medium skin tones, and Golden, to brighten tan and deep complexions. The powder is really finely-milled, with the perfect amount of pigment and brightening particles that gives a matte look all day. Read my full review here . Available: Sephora.com Price: $25 Tarte Rain Forest Of The Sea ‚Äì Filtered Light Setting Powder This super unique formula is designed with tiny, light-reflecting particles that give an incredible airbrushed finish, as it blurs pores and smooths out fine lines. The shade is completely universal so it works for almost everyone, but it‚Äôs also made with antioxidant-rich algae that are actually meant to improve skin texture and reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. We love it when skincare and makeup meet! The powder is super fine, so you need to make sure you don‚Äôt get carried away with the application or you could end up looking cakey. But the biggest issue to note with this powder is the flashback ! Wear it for selfies with no flash, a day at work, or just generally anything that doesn‚Äôt involve flash and you will look flawless, but if you‚Äôre going to have a picture taken, this will leave you looking white and patchy. Read my full review here . Available: Sephora.com Price: $34 Givenchy Prisme Libre Loose Powder One of the absolute fav powders at HBHQ, this Givenchy powder is pretty incredible. It‚Äôs unique because each powder contains four pots of different color correcting loose powders that create one harmonious shade to brighten your skin and leave it looking smooth and luminous. There‚Äôre five different shades so there‚Äôs one to work with every skin tone, but they also offer differing effects, like a natural-finish, radiance, and glow. You can even custom use the powders, so if you have a golden skin tone, for example, you don‚Äôt need to open all the holes on one type of powder, like the beige tone, for example. The packaging is stunning and the powder is even more finely-milled than Ben Nye, it just gives your skin a gorgeous luminous, more polished look. Available: Sephora.com Price: $55 Huda‚Äôs Top Tips: Number 1: avoid the above! For using powders: Take a napkin and pour a small amount of powder on to it and then dab a damp makeup sponge into the powder. On another clean piece of tissue, dab off any excess powder. It makes using your powder extra easy and you can pour any leftover powder back into the pot. For controlling coverage: I always use a damp beauty blender to apply my powders, I feel like it gives a more flawless and natural finish. A big fluffy brush will give you a light dusting of powder, but more dense brushes will give you extra coverage. Start light with brushes so you don‚Äôt end up looking cakey. best setting powder best setting powder for oily skin the best setting powders Wed, 25 Oct 2017 26 Comments Related Posts The BEST (And Cheapest) Drugstore Setting Powder‚Ä¶ Tue, 2 Jan 2018 Melt-Proof Makeup: Your Guide To Looking Flawless In‚Ä¶ Thu, 29 Jun 2017 This Is The BEST Powder You‚Äôll Use All Summer Wed, 21 Jun 2017 Kitkat I definitely loved the Ben Nye Luxury Powder in Banana.

As you know, I love a statement eye, so when we created our new Desert Dusk Palette I wanted it to be full of bold, playful shades. Every time I open it I see new color combinations and new looks I can create. I‚Äôm obsessed with our duo-chrome shades, and of course one of my fav creations for our new eyeshadow palette was our glitter formula, Cosmo. This is literally just pure glitter with a little binder, which makes it super unique, but also a little fragile. And although you can use it completely solo (I just dab it on my lid with my finger), I love using it with a little glitter glue or setting spray and combining it with the shade Celestial, which is this stunning gold pearl formula. Check out my videos below to see how you can simply push your Cosmo glitter back into place if it comes loose, and my fav way of using the Cosmo formula. cosmo glitter desert dusk palette glitter eyeshadow Fri, 20 Oct 2017 4 Comments Related Posts The First Review Of Our Huda Beauty Desert Dusk Palette Fri, 1 Sep 2017 The Desert Dusk Look Book: 3 Looks That Take Less‚Ä¶ Sun, 24 Sep 2017 Video Review: Dramatic Scarlet Look With The Huda‚Ä¶ Sat, 2 Sep 2017 iliana kemalova Hi!

Yes, I have written about it years ago, but it‚Äôs quite shocking to me , that after all this time, it is still my absolute go to before applying makeup! Why? Well because it is hands down my favorite SUPERFICIAL scrub! What that means is that it doesn‚Äôt go deep, but does remove the surface layer of dead skin (that sometimes emulates peach fuzz), allowing for super close makeup-to-skin contact that quick frankly just looks better! I had discovered it in complete skepticism walking through the mall, passing a concession stand. The woman squirted a large size gold-ish ‚Äúgunk‚Äù on my hands, as if I had actually wanted it there in the first place. Not gonna lie, it was one of the best things she could have done (for the both of us, since I purchased what was generously a life-time supply). Since then it has been my absolute staple in my makeup bag and my clients have loved it! Who should use it: I‚Äôve used this on all kinds of clients, from oily to dry and acne prone, as well as clients with skin disorders like Rosacea. I def always recommend consulting a doctor if you have any skin concerns. How to use it: Apply 2-3 squirts of the product to dry skin. Then lightly use circular motions until scrub starts to take effect. You will first feel a slightly gel like texture that will become watery, then the peeling begins. What I don‚Äôt like: Since it does seem to have skin softening properties, it‚Äôs really easy to get your dead skin stuck onto any hairs on your skin. I do recommend using a razor to shave away any peach fuzz for anyone daring enough (I do this all the time) to help avoid this issue. If you have longer facial hair and want to skip shaving you may find yourself picking &amp; pulling pieces of dead skin out of your facial hair.

It‚Äôs a powerful spice that has been used in many Chinese and Ayurvedic recipes for its beautifying and healing properties. Turmeric is an antiaging and antibacterial powerhouse. Mostly due to its curcumin, which gives it its distinct yellow color, it helps combat some of our biggest skincare woes: acne, aging, and dullness. Make your own DIY scrub and mask using it, and you‚Äôre well on your way to brighter, more supple skin. Here are some of our favorite ways to use it: A honey, coconut oil mask In a face mask In a lip scrub In our skincare obsession: Neal‚Äôs Yard Wild Rose Elixir How do you like to use turmeric?

Presuming we‚Äôre right and our title lured in our fellow lazy sisters, we‚Äôve got the easiest arm exercises that give maximum results. Obviously, we didn‚Äôt know where to begin, so we spoke to fitness guru and personal trainer, Jeremy Gwyer ‚Äì when he‚Äôs not writing for Men‚Äôs Health magazine he helps us get in shape with easy hacks . Naturally, the less effort, the better, so we asked Jeremy to give us his simplest and most efficient exercises to get rid of those saggy bits on our upper arms. The best bit is, you don‚Äôt need any techincial gear, you can do them on your couch, and you‚Äôll see results in as little as two weeks ‚Äì if you can be bothered to do them every day! 1. Soup Can Tricep Kickbacks Grab two tin cans, 500mg each should do the trick to start (or bottles of water!). Sitting on the edge of the couch, lean forward with a can in each hand. Then stretch the arms back behind your body keeping them at 90 degrees then slowly straighten your arms back behind your body into a straight position. Keep your elbows locked in position, while pulsing the arms forward and backward in small movements (keeping the cans behind your body at all times). Focus on squeezing your triceps as hard as possible. Do 15 of these three times! 2. Couch Dips Sit on the end of the couch with your hands holding the edges either side of you. Move your feet forwards to lift your bottom off the chair. Keep your knees hip-width apart and bent at 90 degrees. Lower yourself by bending your arms to about 90 degrees, keeping your elbows tucked in. Push back up and do three sets of 15. 3. Lying Soup Can Triceps Extensions Lying on your back on the couch, have your arms straight out in front of your body, holding a soup can in either hand. Lower the soup cans down to your shoulders keeping your elbows tucked in, pointing to the roof. Do 15 of these three times! 4. Easy Push-Ups Start in the push-up position on your knees. Place your hands underneath your shoulders with your arms fully extended, palms flat and fingers facing forward. Your body should form a rigid plank from head to your knees. Lower yourself by bending your elbows out to the sides until your chest is about 2 inches above the floor then push back up until your arms are straight. Do 15 of these three times!

Drink the below concoction 2x daily-first thing in the morning before breakfast &amp; before bed. Add 1 teaspoon of ground cinnamon in 1 cup of boiling water. Stir well making sure that all the cinnamon dissolves. If it doesn‚Äôt, you might want to put the mixture in a teapot and place on the stove for a few minutes. Add a little honey to sweeten if needed. How does this miracle spice shrink your waistline? Studies suggest that using 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon may have a stabilizing effect on blood sugar levels so it may prevent a postmeal insulin spike-this increase normally occurs after you eat and ‚Äúsignals the body that it should store fat rather than burn it.‚Äù (Self Magazine).

Kisses and god bless boo! alya Yayyyy so happy to hear that!!! :))) Thank you so much darling, God bless you!!!! Muuuuahhhhhh Love you!!! My skin-I do whatever Huda tells me üôÇ Right now I am using the Obagi line of products. Ada Love you too hun!!! You are soo sweet and always replying everyone. Hahahaa! She is the beauty guru while you are fitness so totalllly makes sense ;-). Such talented Kattans!! alya Awww thank you so much my love Ada!!! üôÇ We love you!!! Muuahhhhhh Have an awesome day!! &lt;3 Fazila Hey Alya thanks for the tip would definitely try this but have a question how much time does it take to reduce few kgs as i have already lost around 20 kgs and need to lose last 6-7 kgs. I am also eating healthy and do squats, ab excercises, leg raises and 30-45 mins walk 6 days a week. Do you think i need to do anything else apart from the excersice routine i follow alya Hi darling!! üôÇ Congratulations on your amazing weight loss!!! Best of luck love!!! Don‚Äôt give up!!! I suggest losing weight at a safe rate of .5kg to 1 kg per week. Losing weight faster than this, unless under medical supervision, can be harmful (hair loss, saggy skin, malnutrition, etc.). So if you lose 1 kg a week, it should take you 6 to 7 weeks to get at your desired weight. ‚Ä¢ That is great that you walk 6 days a week, keep doing that, but try to mix it up by walking faster, walking up hills, and adding ankle weights because if you do the same exercise over and over again you will eventually hit a plateau where you will fail to see any more changes. To avoid this from happening, you need to always challenge your body so make sure you are changing your workouts every few weeks. You can change the type of exercise you do, the length of time you exercise, the amount of weight lifted or the number or reps. ‚Ä¢ To burn more fat do aerobic exercise first thing in the morning. ‚Ä¢ Do strength training 2 to 3 times a week. You need to weight train your entire body not just your legs. Check out these posts I did http://alyasfitclub.com/2011/12/06/total-body-workout/ http://alyasfitclub.com/2011/10/28/friday-qa/ Here are some diet recommendations that can help speed up your fast loss ‚Ä¢ Cayenne pepper and Tabasco sauce help your body burn more fat. Use these spices on your favorite dishes. ‚Ä¢ Eating ¬Ω a grapefruit with each meal daily helps melt the fat off! ‚Ä¢ Studies have shown that berries can help you burn up to 30% more fat during exercise! Try this fat blasting concoction next time before your workout: blend 1 cup berries and ¬º cup balsamic vinegar. ‚Ä¢ Eat more fruits and vegetables ( http://alyasfitclub.com/2012/05/08/alyas-hot-body-tip-of-the-day-64/#more-6151 ) What I like to do is have soup and salad with my lunch and dinner Talia I put at least a tablespoon in my coffee a day. Does that help too? Fazila Thank you so much Alya for such great tips.. I would definitely try these. I also follow your instagram account and really you motivate me with all the pics you post. alya Yes Talia darling that helps-cinnamon is so good for you, I like to sprinkle it on my oatmeal, tea, yogurt to add sweetness without adding calories. But of course you still have to exercise and watch what you eat.

I am sure you guys have seen the pics. Want to learn her secret to conquering her lifetime struggle with her weight? Khloe spilled her beautifying tips to the February issue of Cosmopolitan Australia: Her take on exercising ‚ÄúI‚Äôve definitely become obsessed with working out! she said. It‚Äôs funny, because my weight has always fluctuated ‚Äì but recently so many people have been saying ‚Äòyou look so good, you‚Äôve lost all this weight.‚Äô It‚Äôs actually been about a year and a half that I‚Äôve been making a lifestyle change. There‚Äôs no quick fix, I would say. I love to box. Boxing is really fun, and it‚Äôs such a stress reliever. I‚Äôm just so busy having fun, I forget that I‚Äôm working out; 45 minutes go by and I‚Äôm dripping wet. We do a lot of workouts together, my sisters and I, and we go on a lot of hikes and walks outside. I never like doing the same workout two days in a row, I just get bored.‚Äù Here take on dieting ‚ÄúIf I ate better, I would lose weight faster, but I don‚Äôt want to. I love food and there‚Äôs lots of family time with food and your friends. I work out really hard so I can have my champagne and that part of life. I‚Äôd rather take longer to lose weight, but have fun doing it.‚Äù Job well done Khloe, you look amazing!! I love that she doesn‚Äôt focus too much on the diet process and more on having fun with it! I honestly believe when you focus too hard on something, you can get the opposite results! It‚Äôs great to just have fun and let things flow naturally! Khloe said it took a year and half to make those changes, this just shows you it‚Äôs a lifestyle and mindset that she has now adapted, and it‚Äôs no wonder she has had such huge success with it! I think she has earned the title of hottest Kardashian. What do you guys think? Here are 5 more easy and fun ways to lose weight! 1. Take a dance class with your friends! This will help you work many body parts, and have fun (not to mention it‚Äôs great to tone your butt and love handles) 2. Go Rollerblading! This is such a fun way to work out and it doesn‚Äôt have to be too intense! 3. Take your BFF/spouse for a bike ride. Bike riding is awesome for your body and gives you great legs, it can also help you bond with some close friends! 4. Swimming! Swimming is so much fun and it is a great way to workout without even realizing it! It‚Äôs also great for your joints 5. Walking in the Park! While Khloe likes to hike, walking with friends can be such a great way to bond, talk and also get some exercise in!

Muuahhhhhh GOUMANA HALLO ALYA .., I REALLY WANNA BE LIKE THOSE BODYS BUT LET ME ASK , HOW CAN I ? I‚ÄôM GAVE BIRTH 3 MONTHES AGO AND I‚ÄôM A BREAST FEEDING MOTHER, WHAT ARE UR RECOMMENDATIONS TO LOSS WEIGHT? alya Hi darling üôÇ If you are new to exercise, start out with gentle activities like walking, stretching, post-natal yoga classes, or swimming. Remember that for 3 to 5 months following pregnancy, your joints and ligaments are still looser than normal, meaning that you‚Äôre more prone to certain injuries. Since you‚Äôre breast feeding, your body needs about 500 extra calories a day to continue producing milk. Although exercising does not inhibit milk production, a lack of sufficient calories and nutrients can. Even though your goal is to shed that baby weight, be sure you‚Äôre eating enough calories to sustain your body, your increased activity and your baby. When doing cardio, aim to maintain an intensity that allows you to carry on a conversation but still raises your heart rate. Never exercise so intensely that you feel lightheaded, dizzy or weak. If you feel sharp pains, stop immediately. After pregnancy, many women‚Äôs abdominal muscles are still separated. If the width between your stomach muscles is 3 fingers or more, avoid doing intense abdominal exercises like sit ups and double leg lifts. You can measure the width by lying flat on your back with your knees bent and feeling a few inches below your belly button to see if there is a separation in the abdominal wall. Wait until the gap has closed to two fingers or less before starting an ab routine. Lifting weights will give you a more toned look, boost your metabolism, and help burn fat. Lift weights at least two days per week, doing one to three sets of eight to 12 reps for each exercise. Check out this post I did on total body workout with exercise bands http://alyasfitclub.com/2011/12/06/total-body-workout/ Just take it slow, don‚Äôt try to lose too much too fast, if you eat properly and exercise the weight will come off.

Well, that was us when we discovered jojoba oil . In its pure form, it‚Äôs like the fairy godmother of oils: it‚Äôs good for your skin and hair, can help to reduce wrinkles, improve acne, and can basically be used as an all-around beautifying serum. Although it‚Äôs technically a wax, it‚Äôs amazingly moisturizing, non-toxic, doesn‚Äôt block pores and is non-allergenic. It‚Äôs also full of minerals and vitamin E, and it‚Äôs an antioxidant which protects from free radicals ‚Äì it can literally do no wrong. Here are 5 awesome uses for jojoba oil: Acne and oily skin: First off, it penetrates the hair follicles where sebum builds up and acts as a deep cleanser to dissolve the sebum that causes blackheads. Because the waxy structure of jojoba oil is so similar to human sebum, it actually tricks acne-prone skin into believing it has produced enough, so that your skin produces less ‚Äì bye bye oily skin! Jojoba oil is also a potent anti-fungal agent and is full of antibacterial properties that kill acne-causing bacteria. Because it‚Äôs like a liquid wax, it also acts as a barrier against dirt while it‚Äôs anti-inflammatory properties further fight acne. Use 4-5 drops of jojoba oil before make-up or up to six at night ‚Äì six or more can make your skin look oily. Anti-aging: Jojoba oil is rich in antioxidants and contains vitamin B complex, which combined, delays the appearance of premature aging and soothes fine lines and wrinkles. Make-up removal: Like coconut oil, jojoba oil is an amazing natural make-up remover that easily flushes away dirt and make-up, as well as bacteria on your skin. Hair loss and healing: Let‚Äôs face it, we‚Äôd all love a bit more hair, and hair is more easily able to grow when moisture is restored, and the scalp is in a healthy state. Blocked hair follicles can be caused by excess sebum production or excess product build-up, a possible reason for hair loss. Jojoba oil works to unclog pores and treat any fungal bacteria. The oil also helps to promote new growth by stimulating scalp circulation, thereby encouraging new hair cells to develop. Gently warm one tablespoon of jojoba oil and rub it into your scalp 30 minutes before shampooing to improve hair health, get rid of dandruff, and detox your scalp. Use 1 or 2 drops on your hair after washing for extra shine and to control frizz. The ultimate moisturizer: It‚Äôs also an excellent healer for dry cuticles, hands, and feet. Soak your hands, feet or cuticles in warm water for 5 to 10 minutes. After, rub a drop of oil into cuticles, or use 5 to 6 drops for hands and feet to nourish dry skin. Applying one drop of jojoba oil to chapped lips will add instant relief, and the waxy substance will also further protect your skin from the elements. The vitamin E rich oil is also meant to calm sunburn, diminish the appearance of scars, and help heal wounds. *Image via www.stylecraze.com jojoba oil jojoba oil benefits Mon, 20 Feb 2017 2 Comments Related Posts 3 Super Easy DIY Hair Rescue Masks Mon, 13 Nov 2017 Why You Need To Add A Face Oil To Your Skincare Regime Sun, 12 Nov 2017 Why Not Understanding Your Skin Type Is Keeping You‚Ä¶ Wed, 29 Nov 2017 Jeanelle Lightfoot The article posted was very informative and useful.

The Serbian goddess of a model (Zeljka Budimir) came straight from Milan and was insanely talented. We had the red camera on set too, which made everything even more exciting. Here are some photos from our shoot.

We love your Fashion Gossip 10 blog and your undoubtedly Dubai most fashionable diva. May you have a year full of fabulousness!! We love you! in hair Silky-Soft-Hair! Oh My!! by hudabeauty Tue, 9 Mar 2010 2 Comments Summer sun will soon be shining on our doorstep, but with the sunshine comes the humidity and then (cue 1920‚Äôs horror film background music) FRIZZ! We‚Äôve all heard of the Brazilian Keratin Treatment and if you haven‚Äôt done it already, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve at least been a bit curious as to what the hype is all about. I personally never thought I could benefit from this treatment as my hair is pin-straight and I was frightened to lose volume. But as a licensed cosmetologist (providing the service at a very reasonable price ), I had to at least try it out for myself. My verdict: Keratin is great for EVERYONE! Keratin is the main protective substance in our hair. Adding more keratin to our hair improves each strand inside and out. Keratin will not only make your hair shinier, healthier and stronger, but it also protects from environmental damage caused by the sun that cause hair color to fade. The great thing about the Brazilian Keratin Treatment is it‚Äôs just a reconditioning treatment ‚Äìshocking‚Äîa salon procedure that gives you beautiful, silky hair, without the damage! BEWARE: Most Keratin Treatments contain the carcinogen, formaldehyde. So, say no to brain tumors and consult your stylist to ensure they are using formaldehyde-free products. These formaldehyde-free products are significantly more costly to the stylist/salon. So, expect the formaldehyde-free Keratin Treatment to be a bit pricier than other salons that use products containing the cancer-causing chem. If any time to splurge on the higher end product, this is it. Expect silky locks for 3-5 months, depending on your products and how often you wash. Blow out time cut in half! Frizz-nonestistent. Without effort, tight curls will be naturally wavy. Waves will be naturally straight. Best place to get this treatment in Boston Area: contact Candice (+1774.930.8731) Not only will you get the formaldehyde-free treatment at $150, which is less than the standard $180, but you will also be on your way with all the tools to maintain your soft tresses at a discount price. Recommended products by Candice: Pureology Antifade ZeroSulfate Shampoo and Conditioner (Retails at $27 each 10.1 oz, she sells for $20 each with treatment). photo courtesy of myhairstylingtools -Candice, edited by H.Kattan in Uncategorized Get Bigger Lips with Lip Yoga by hudabeauty Mon, 8 Mar 2010 Leave a comment [youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIrPr3KwK7E&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;] ‚Äì H.Kattan in beauty Makeup Mannequins by hudabeauty Mon, 8 Mar 2010 Leave a comment Makeup doesn‚Äôt get more flawless than on the catwalk ‚Ä¶ some of the finest trends in beauty emerge, do you dare?

After spending close to 5 hours in Thai sun, and using ZERO PROTECTION, my skin thanked me, cordially. It was the first time both my husband and I had burned in our lives. Needless to say, we peeled like bananas. My skin‚Äîbloootchy!! I had numerous Moroccan bath, scrubs, etc. and nothing truly made my skin look flawless again. Luckily for me, Perfekt came to my rescue. This incredibly silky formula makes your skin look even and bronzed. I try stay out of the sun now, but I still use this amazing product. Any night I have an event or wedding to go to, I simply apply this to my arms, legs and decolletege. It also adds the slightest amount of shimmer, which is to-die-for! Now you can have your Perfekt skin! Literally!

I love to be bronzed, I can‚Äôt help it! Although I may fancy the sun-kissed-goddess look, my skin hates it! So much, that it decided to wrinkle like a prune when I hit my mid-twenties:( Thankfully, I was introduced to Peter Thomas Roth‚Äôs (PTR) UnWrinkle‚Äìfinally, a product that literally does what it says. The super-smoothing formula is made up six peptides that relax, smooth, and prevent wrinkles. If that doesn‚Äôt sound good enough for you, one of the peptides actually boost the production of collagen. Seems too good to be true? Well, the only draw back is that you have to continuously use this product to maintain results, but trust me, you will want to! I never travel without it!

If like me you enjoy the cake but don‚Äôt want to look cakey, then trust me, living in Dubai has taught me the fine art of melt-proof makeup. The secret is all in the setting, and no, I don‚Äôt mean just a setting spray, there‚Äôs a technique to it: Prep your base: Don‚Äôt overlook your skin care in the summer, exfoliation is so important. When you‚Äôre using a lot of powders, having a clean, smooth canvas is essential as powder particles can cling to any flaky patches and magnify dry skin. Moisturize: Many people think if there‚Äôs heat they‚Äôll sweat and become oily, this is true, but that doesn‚Äôt mean you should avoid moisturizer. Actually, when your skin gets dry, your sebaceous glands produce even more oil to compensate, so stick with an oil-free moisturizer that will balance your skin. I have dry to combination skin, and I use oils, even in the summer and the humidity of Dubai, but I just ensure that I set everything properly. Prime: Primers will definitely help to keep your face in place ‚Äì I like the Benefit Porefessional Primer and TooFaced‚Äôs Hangover Primer. And though I definitely think primers help to keep your makeup in place, setting your makeup properly is the key to keeping your look on lockdown. Set, set, and set again: This is the key to staying flawless no matter what the weather throws at you. First things first invest in a good powder: it‚Äôll save you time, stress, and money in touch ups. Laura Mercier‚Äôs Secret Brightening Powder or Translucent Loose Setting Powders are iconic for a reason, they just work, but Kat Von D‚Äôs Brightening Powders are my new obsession ( read my review )! I think baking in the summer is fundamental for a flawless last-all-day look, and my trick is to bake with different powders in different areas: it‚Äôs almost like I‚Äôm contouring and color correcting with translucent powders. I use a micro-fine peachy toned powder under my eyes (where makeup and concealers tend to crease) and on my T-zone ‚Äì the finer the powder, the less likely it is that it‚Äôll sit in creases and define wrinkles. Finally, I use a golden/yellow toned translucent powder all over, and a darker powder on my forehead and cheeks. ‚Ä¶Then use a setting spray: To top off all your setting, a setting spray will add the finishing touch to hold your makeup in place. My FAVs are Urban Decay‚Äôs All Nighter Long-Lasting Makeup Setting Spray and the Kat Von D Lock It Setting Spray. This setting method just ensures my makeup just doesn‚Äôt budge all day ‚Äì I‚Äôm talking 12 hours, completely flawless makeup. I even set my brows, so basically, anywhere that there‚Äôs gel or pigment, I dab with powder to set. You can also try the Jamsu makeup setting method , which will keep even the oiliest of skins at bay during seriously hot weather. long-lasting makeup makeup setting setting spray summer makeup Thu, 29 Jun 2017 7 Comments Related Posts This Is The BEST Powder You‚Äôll Use All Summer Wed, 21 Jun 2017 The BEST (And Cheapest) Drugstore Setting Powder‚Ä¶ Tue, 2 Jan 2018 Powder-Off: We Compared The Most Iconic Setting Powders Wed, 25 Oct 2017 Johanna Thank you Huda for all your tips and tricks I will put them on practice.

Check out these three super easy looks I created to showcase the versatility and playfulness of our Desert Dusk palette. Violet Vixen This look perfectly reflects the hazy purple sky of the desert at dusk, and I‚Äôm in love with these violet shades for fall. The rich Amethyst matte, combined with the shimmering pearls and duo-chrome topper creates a light shifting effect that makes this look so unique. Recreate the look: Use Amethyst all over the lid as a base and blend up into the crease. Intensify the crease using Oud and smoke it out in the inner and outer corners. Lightly blend Royal into the lid and then dab Twilight all over with your finger to maximize shine. Cosmo Queen I‚Äôm obsessed with the shade Eden, it was one of the first colors that I created, and it makes the perfect base for so many looks, as well as looking gorgeous just by itself. This amber toned look is sultry and powerful and has such a sophisticated tone to it, while the glitter shade Cosmo gives it a vibrant finish. Recreate the look: Use Eden as a canvas all over your lid all the way to meet the brow. Use Amber in the crease, winging it out towards the outer edge of the eye. Pat Celestial all over the eye with your finger for maximum shine, and use a brush to blend the outer edges. Add drama with Cosmo, using a stiff eyeliner brush, dip it gently into the pure, ready-to-wear glitter formula and dab across your lash line. Scarlet Siren This is like the ultimate boss look! The vibrant siennas and scarlets are intensified by the sand-toned base and rich mahogany liner and combine to create a really powerful, seductive statement eye that is perfect for night‚Äôs out and events. Recreate the look: Prep the whole lid up to the brow with Desert Sand, then mix Blazing and Amber for the crease and smoke out into a wing shape. Intensify the lid with a layer of shimmering Saffron and pack along the lower lash line. Dab a thin eyeliner brush into Oud and apply it as an eyeliner along your upper lash line, finishing with a subtle wing. I also created a super dreamy peach and purple look that‚Äôs perfect for daytime, check it out here . I hope you love these looks and we can‚Äôt wait to see what you all create!

I‚Äôve discovered some seriously life-changing products over the last few years, so I wanted to give you the run down on my absolute FAVs! I get to try so many awesome beauty goodies (I‚Äôve tried some pretty terrible ones too), and I consider myself so lucky that I can help you find amazing beauty products too. It‚Äôs SO hard to choose just ten, but honestly, I really can‚Äôt imagine my skin without these, all of them have made such an incredible difference! So here are my ten, can‚Äôt live without, life-changing products: SkinCeuticals ‚Äì C E Ferulic Serum Recommended to me by a ton of beauty experts, the C E Ferulic serum is my latest obsession, and I literally can‚Äôt imagine my skin without it! It‚Äôs packed with antioxidants, and since I‚Äôve been using it my skin tone has become so even, and it‚Äôs improved my pigmentation and acne scars too. I don‚Äôt even feel like I need to wear a high coverage foundation anymore. The Chemistry Brand ‚Äì Hand Chemistry Intense Youth Complex This is hands down (no pun intended) the best hand cream I‚Äôve ever used. As a bit of a germophobe, I wash my hands like crazy, so I need something super hydrating. This contains some really incredible ingredients that actually make your hands look younger: The darkness of my knuckles has faded (I know this is a super frustrating issue many women struggle with), and my hands just look fresh and new. Tony Moly ‚Äì Intense Care Snail Gold 24k Hydrogel Mask If ever my skin needs hydration, this is the mask I turn to. It gives your skin a beautiful glow, and you don‚Äôt need to wear it for ages to get visible results. I use this literally every time I fly. Check out my full review. REN ‚Äì Rose O¬π¬≤ Moisture Defence Oil Containing one of the highest concentrations of rose in any skincare product in the world, this is extremely nourishing and penetrates really deep into your skin. As someone with super dry skin, this keeps it so soft and supple! It‚Äôs literally the first thing I reach for in the morning, and it creates the perfect canvas for makeup. Mario Badescu ‚Äì Facial Spray With Aloe, Herb, and Rosewater I have this in every corner of my house, and I can‚Äôt go a day without it! It smells divine, and it‚Äôs actually perfect to apply after makeup as it sets it SO nicely! Although I‚Äôm prone to acne, I‚Äôve found that the combination of rose, aloe, and herbs really keep my skin under control while still keeping it hydrated. It‚Äôs definitely a must product for acne-prone skin. Lancer ‚Äì The Method Polish For an intense scrub, this is undoubtedly the best! It‚Äôs the grittiest face scrub I have, and it really gets rid of ALL dead skin. I always use it before a photo shoot to get perfectly smooth skin, which creates the best canvas for applying makeup. If you have dry to sensitive skin, you should only use it once a week, but for people with oily skin, this is the best thing you can try. Institut Esthederm E.V.E. Serum I swear by this ‚Äì it really is life-changing! The company created an enzyme, which literally grows new skin, so it heals everything, and will really diminish the appearance of scars . It‚Äôll make your skin look flawless, but I recommend using it at night as it‚Äôs not the best for makeup application. Baby Quasar This isn‚Äôt a new product, but this red-light therapy tool really is unparalleled as far as the results it gives your skin! It makes your skin glow, it boosts collagen like crazy, helps with wrinkles, pigmentation, scarring, and keeps your skin looking youthful. You can even use it to treat rosacea and psoriasis ‚Äì it‚Äôs just the ultimate thing for skin! It‚Äôs expensive, but an investment worth making if you‚Äôre serious about skincare. See how I use mine to get rid of acne scars . Guerlain ‚Äì Orchid Imperial Face Serum This is something I use before a big moment, like an event, photo shoot, interview, or a wedding, and it‚Äôs like a magic serum that makes you look healthy, glowy, dewy, and just stunning! The science and ingredients are really remarkable, and it‚Äôs the best thing to use before makeup application. It‚Äôs super expensive though, so it was something I didn‚Äôt buy immediately, but I finally found it in Dubai Duty-Free and took the plunge. Caudalie Divine Oil Ever since I tried this a few years ago, I‚Äôve used it nearly every day, and I take a mini with me when I travel (I can even use it in my hair)!

I‚Äôve been using this 3-step process facial for 15 years, and it‚Äôs literally THE BEST way to remove all kinds of dead skin. The genius step-by-step process was actually created after one of their celebrity clients begged for an on-the-go version of their famous facial service. The result is an insanely good exfoliating polish, peel, and clay mask that leaves your skin feeling like velvet. What it is: A professional facial with a 3-step microdermabrasion and AHA peel for the ultimate at-home complexion transformation. It banishes dull and uneven skin tone and works wonders on all skin types. What it does: The first step is an exfoliating Almond Polish Facial Scrub, which uses bamboo extracts and oat kernel flour to buff away dead skin cells. Step two is the Instant Transformation Lemon Facial Peel: it uses alpha hydroxy acids, (which occur naturally in fruits and break down the outer layers of skin to reveal new, healthy cells) and glycolic and lactic acids to smooth skin and reduce the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles, and discoloration. Lastly, the soothing Chamomile Comfort Mask calms your skin with evening primrose seed extracts. What we liked: I LOVE everything about this facial, and so does my skin! The almond scrub is invigorating, and you can really feel it making a difference, plus it smells so good I could eat it! I rub it everywhere for a good 2 minutes and then wash it off with a bamboo cloth ‚Äì the kit also comes with really great sponges for this purpose. The lemon peel is one of THE most amazing things I have ever used: it gives you crazy radiance and boosts your skin‚Äôs hydration. Although, it can sting when you use it, especially in the areas where you‚Äôve scrubbed vigorously with the Almond Polish ‚Äì but hey, the stinging lets you know the peel‚Äôs working, right? Oh, and definitely don‚Äôt leave it on for longer than the 2 minutes it says, trust me on that! When you apply the chamomile mask on top, your skin is immediately soothed, and you can sit back and relax for 15 minutes. Then rinse it away, and you‚Äôre completely selfie-ready. What we didn‚Äôt like: Literally NOTHING! Even the price is incredibly fair. You get six facials in a box, but I actually only use half, and usually split one with Alya or Mona, so technically you get 12. It works out at a fraction of the price of a salon facial, and you can do it from home too. I‚Äôve always had super sensitive skin, but this just works ahhhmazingly. It doesn‚Äôt break you out; it just leaves your skin in flawless condition with everything buffed to perfection. I recommend this to everyone!

We love the summer, but it‚Äôs not our best friend ‚Äì the heat does things to our skin that messes with our cake face, so come lunch time, we‚Äôre a hot shiny mess. Well, fear the oil slick no longer, here are nine ways to keep your skin under control this summer: Don‚Äôt Over Cleanse The more oil we see, the more we feel like we need to wash our face. Unfortunately, washing your face doesn‚Äôt mean you will wash away oil ‚Äì if only it were that easy! The thing is your face has natural oils, and when they get stripped away by harsh chemicals in face washes, your skin goes into overdrive and produces more. Look for face washes without parabens, sulfates, oils, and perfumes and try to find a gel formula, that only foams a little ‚Äì this will be more gentle on your skin. And it‚Äôs not just about using the right face wash either, don‚Äôt overwash your skin: twice a day is more than enough, but the most important time to wash your face is after makeup ‚Äì a makeup wipe just won‚Äôt cut it. Moisturize! I know, I know, it goes against all your instincts, but our resident Skincare Queen and award-winning dermatologist, Dr. Doris Day swears moisturizing is essential, even if you have oil-prone skin. Dr. Day explained dry skin sends your sebaceous glands into overdrive, and they end up producing even more oil to compensate for the lack of moisture. So actually, keeping your skin hydrated in the summer will help to combat excess oil production. Try an oil-free moisturizer, which will hydrate without adding oil, and always leave about ten minutes for it to soak into your skin before you apply primer or foundation. Put Down the Ice Cream It‚Äôs summer, you‚Äôre hot, and you want an ice cream, but the truth is dairy can cause a major unbalance in your hormones‚Ä¶ and we all know what hormones can do! Dairy milk is full of hormones, and when you consume it, it causes all your other hormones to rise, including your testosterone and progesterone levels, which are the main causes of excess oil and sebum production. Switch to almond milk in your coffee and try an iced tea to keep you cool instead‚Ä¶ OKAY, okay, maybe one ice cream is allowed! Try Milk of Magnesia If anything can keep your oil at bay, it‚Äôs Milk of Magnesia. It‚Äôs not actually milk; it‚Äôs a laxative. It works by absorbing surface oil on your skin, making it an incredible primer. MUA Hrush Achemyan uses this on her celeb clientele to create a barrier between the skin and makeup to stop foundation seeping into pores under hot camera lights. To use, apply moisturizer and then with a cotton pad, blot the Milk of Magnesia onto your skin or oil-prone areas like your T-zone and gently rub it in (use sparingly). Leave it for a few minutes to ‚Äòset‚Äô and then apply your foundation as usual. Although this is king for oil control, don‚Äôt use it too often: It‚Äôs not directly harmful to your skin, but its PH levels are much lower than your skin‚Äôs PH. If you use it too frequently, it could cause breakouts or dryness ‚Äì save it for a special occasion or day in the sun. Use a Mattifying Primer Use a mattifying primer to avoid the dreaded mid-day foundation cake. The oil-free, Hourglass Veil Mineral Primer, $54 , is universally appreciated for its magical anti-oil formula, which contains powerful absorbents, a mineral-based sunscreen, and a silicone base. It makes your skin incredibly smooth, poreless and silky and it‚Äôll keep your makeup set in place all day, all while warding away any hint of oil. Look out for primers with silica in them, as this plays a major role in diminishing shine. Too Faced‚Äôs Primed &amp; Poreless skin smoothing face primer is also an amazing primer that will do more than just control your T-zone. Curb Your Weekend Antics We‚Äôre sorry to be the ones to tell you, but if a boozy weekend with your gal pals is on the cards, your oil glands won‚Äôt thank you for it. Drinking too much alcohol causes your body‚Äôs heat index to rise, increasing your temperature and the amount you sweat, this can lead to clogged pores, excess oil, and eventually breakouts too. So go have fun, but not too much fun! Blot Oil Away With Blotting Paper If you‚Äôre not yet aware of this trick, blotting paper will become your best friend through the day. Plus, in the midst of summer, we‚Äôre all prone to a little extra oil on our T-zone, so mini blotting paper sheets are the easiest thing to carry around in your purse to keep your skin shine-free through the day. There are a ton of options: Clean &amp; Clear do a pack of 50 mini Oil Absorbing Sheets for just $5, while Tarte‚Äôs green tea-infused Not So Slick Oil Absorbing Blotting papers , $10 for 50 sheets, offer soothing relief for your skin as well as mopping up oil. You can also find blotting papers that have a thin layer of powder on them, which mattify your skin too. If none of those are to hand, a tissue will do! Bake Like You‚Äôve Never Baked Before‚Ä¶ For special occasions, there‚Äôs no doubt that Jamsu will put your oil back in its place. It‚Äôs a Korean beauty hack that involves an all-over face-baking technique. After using a ton of powder, you submerge your face in water. The result is a completely matte finish that lasts all day. Watch me try this crazy water-setting technique here ‚Äì it really works! Try a Clay Mask A clay mask at least once a week is an amazing way to draw out excess oil, calm and soothe your skin. I‚Äôve been a long time fan of the GLAMGLOW Supermud Clearing Treatment , it leaves my skin super smooth, and the mud formula works to balance your skin‚Äôs PH while activated charcoal draws out dirt and impurities that block pores. When it comes to keeping your oily skin at bay, the main thing to remember is not to rush to drastic measures. Take small steps to cut back on naughty foods, balance your diet, and find products that will help your skin. Try to adopt a few of these tricks and you‚Äôll be sure to notice a difference.

That‚Äôs what I thought, so when I heard about Bulletproof Coffee, I had to try it. In case you didn‚Äôt know, I‚Äôm actually a bit of a nerd, I love reading (I try to read a book a week). Earlier this year I picked up a New York Times Bestseller called The Bulletproof Diet, a book about wellness, enhancing brain power, and becoming healthier both physically and mentally: It was fascinating ‚Äì it‚Äôs like a whole other world of dieting ‚Äì but that‚Äôs another story! Although I still follow a lot of the practices from the Bulletproof diet, the one thing I found that made an incredible impact on my mind and body (and my waist!) was Bulletproof coffee. Bulletproof coffee is made using organic coffee, coconut oil, and grass-fed butter ‚Äì I know, it sounds weird AF, bear with me! It basically makes the coffee much more potent and minimizes the risk of your brain and body crashing after a few hours. It also boosts your metabolic rate to help you lose weight, but most importantly it gives you amazing clarity and focus. The coconut oil balances your hunger hormones making you feel full, while the saturated fat in grass-fed butter slows the absorption of caffeine, which gives you a longer-lasting energy boost, instead of a spike of intense energy that usually (for me) ends in jitters and a crash of energy levels. It also improves mental clarity as the coconut oil converts to Ketones, an energy that your brain uses more efficiently than any other form, this combined with the slow release of coffee makes such a crazy difference, that you can just feel your brain working more powerfully. I know, it sounds too good to be true, but I swear by it! I drink it probably three or four days a week on the days I really need to focus, otherwise, I drink green tea , which is also amazing for your skin, body, and focus. How to make Bulletproof coffee: It‚Äôs super easy to make! Take two tablespoons of grass-fed butter and add one teaspoon of organic Coconut Oil (or the official Brain Octane Oil, which is basically a very high-quality coconut oil), and freshly brewed organic coffee and combine the ingredients in a blender for 20 seconds. Honestly, it tastes really good, and the blending process gives it a nice froth on top as well, like a latte. I really recommend that anyone try this; it‚Äôs super easy to make, inexpensive, and something I don‚Äôt see myself quitting anytime soon! Not into drinking coffee? It‚Äôs great for your skin too! Try out our Bulletproof DIY body scrub: Combine one cup of ground organic coffee, one cup of brown sugar, and half a cup of melted organic coconut oil. You can store it in a tub and use two to three times a week. This makes such an invigorating, skin-softening scrub as the coconut oil is amazingly hydrating, coffee is full of antioxidants, and the brown sugar makes an amazing natural scrub.

I loved the taste admittedly, but the high fat levels gave me and my friend a feverish feeling halfway through. We both had to sit it out because we were in complete hot flushes and flusters. At 27, that‚Äôs not something we felt familiar with. I probably might try doing the home made version and amend the amount of oils that go in now I know how, because I actually really liked the almost salted coffee taste. Thanks lady for sharing! HB Team Hi my love, definitely try to persist with it, and use less oil to start with. Your body will get used to it and then you can add more.

Now just because you have a problem doesn‚Äôt mean you are stuck with it! In fact, I honestly have always felt that the reason I had so many beauty issues growing up was so that I can share the tips on getting rid of those annoying imperfections with the world (being the hairiest of my family, having stretch marks, sun spots, hair loss, acne, everything!). In case it‚Äôs not obvious, I honestly do feel that‚Äôs my purpose in life as silly as it may sound, but I love helping people feel more beautiful and I have waaaay before I started this blog. So when I found those adorable dimples, I wasn‚Äôt surprised! I have found several great tips on getting rid of them, my favorite being using dry brushing , but a great tip for getting rid of cellulite starts from the inside! If you find you have any cellulite of if you really just want to cleanse a bit, try drinking this awesome cellulite drink‚Äìand I don‚Äôt mean it tastes awesome, it‚Äôs not bad it‚Äôs lemonade with a kick, but it works really great! Don‚Äôt be surprised if your skin starts to glow and if it clears up as well! Now for the real question: Was I able to get rid of my dimples, still working on it, but almost completely (with a little discipline)! CELLULITE FIGHTING DRINK: 1 cup cold water 2-3 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice 1-2 teaspoons cayenne pepper Mix all ingredients together very well in a glass, add organic maple syrup if desired. Drink no more than twice a day for a week at a time. If you‚Äôre pregnant or nursing, speak to your doctor before trying any cleansing techniques. image credits watchmojo beauty body cellulite health Tue, 8 Feb 2011 51 Comments Related Posts I Doubled My Water Intake For 7 Days And You Won‚Äôt‚Ä¶ Tue, 15 Aug 2017 No One Knows About This Drink, But It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ Thu, 19 Oct 2017 I Started Drinking Collagen And I‚Äôm Obsessed With‚Ä¶ Sat, 16 Dec 2017 rosario I like that drink ,love the heat from the cayenne pepper.

This means knowing your skin type and its properties is crucial. It sounds easy, but it‚Äôs actually the most common skincare mistake people make. Your skin is hereditary, so although you can‚Äôt change it, you can rebalance it with the right regime. If you‚Äôre confused by your skin type and use the wrong products, it can compromise your skin‚Äôs natural balance and result in breakouts, irritation, inflammation, and even premature aging. So, to keep you from making this HUGE mistake, we‚Äôve broken down each skin type so you‚Äôll be able to self-diagnose and FINALLY get it right! Oily skin What it looks like: If you have oily skin, it‚Äôll be shiny and greasy with large, visible pores. The level of shine will typically increase around midday and the oil will affect your previously flawless foundation. You‚Äôll also be prone to inflammatory acne; pustules and pimples, as well as non-inflammatory acne, like blackheads and whiteheads. Oily skin can also be prompted by any form of hormone change, like your period or pregnancy. Why it‚Äôs oily: Our body produces a natural oil called sebum to help maintain soft and supple skin. If too much sebum is produced, it sits on your skin‚Äôs surface resulting in blocked pores and a greasy appearance. The overproduction of sebum also means that your pores are larger as it causes the follicles to expand. On the plus side, if you have oily skin, you‚Äôre expected to age better üòâ Acne-prone skin What it looks like: If you have acne, your skin will be extremely oily, with a significant amount of blackheads and whiteheads as well as pustules, pimples, and papules in concentrated patches. These are caused by the blockage of hair follicles due to the overproduction of sebum and dead skin cells. Combination skin What it looks like: Combination skin is super common and consists of two, massively contrasting skin types: oily and dry. The skin on your T-zone (forehead and nose) will typically be oily, resulting in larger pores, while your cheeks and other areas will be dry, tight and flakey with smaller pores. Top tip: We know it sounds extra AF, but it‚Äôll help if you use different products to target different areas of your skin. Concentrate your clay mask on your T-zone only and avoid using thicker creams on your T-zone. Normal skin If you have ‚Äònormal‚Äô skin, you‚Äôll have no visible pores, blemishes, flaky areas or oily patches. The texture of your skin will be smooth and is more likely to look radiant and youthful due to the well-balanced level of moisture, sebum, and keratin. Basically, you‚Äôre BLESSED. Dry Skin What it looks like: Dry skin is often dull, especially around the eyes, accentuating fine lines and wrinkles. Your pores will be small and barely visible but your skin will often feel tight, rough and may even chap ‚Äì you‚Äôre also more likely to have eczema or dermatitis. Why it‚Äôs dry: Dry skin is caused by a lack of moisture in the corneous layer, which also makes your pores less visible due to the lack of sebum. The lack of moisture also means that your skin loses its natural elasticity, which is why it feels tight. Aging skin What it looks like: Aging skin will often be dry, and will look translucent and pale, as the top layer of skin, the epidermis, is thinning. The skin will also appear saggy, especially around the eyes and neck due to a loss of moisture and elasticity. Aging skin is also prone to dark pigmented spots resulting from sun damage and potentially bad health habits. Test your skin: Wash your face thoroughly with warm water, cleanse and then pat dry with a towel. Leave your skin to sit fresh and clean for 30 minutes, get the mirror and take a good look ‚Äì are your pores visible or not, do you have spots or whiteheads ‚Äì access your skin, and see how it compares with the above categories! Repeat this test every six months, as your skin is always changing, responding to internal factors like your hormones, age or diet, plus external factors like the weather. Now you know your skin type (and remember, is can fluctuate), there‚Äôs no reason why you can‚Äôt cater all of your products to your skin‚Äôs specific needs. So, check out our guides to make sure you‚Äôre using the right moisturizer , cleanser , and toner for your skin type. finding your skin type skin type Skincare Wed, 29 Nov 2017 11 Comments Related Posts 5 Reasons Why You Need Jojoba Oil in Your Life!

Thank you Huda love you x Amira Hi Huda! I struggle with dry undereyes. I apply a thin layer of vaseline under my eyes over my moisturizer before I apply my make up, but when I apply powder (I use Laura Mercier), I tried baking and just swiping some powder to set ‚Äì both end with my undereyes looking dry and my fine lines looking SO obvious. HB Team Hi my love, I would avoid using Vaseline during the daytime under makeup; it will cause your powder and makeup to settle into fine lines. Instead try using sweet almond oil or a very hydrating eye cream (try Origins) at night time, and then an eye cream during the day, but wait 15 mins before applying makeup to allow it to soak into your skin. You could also check with your doctor üòâ xxx Debbie Cisneros ..,but then what! If I understand I have aging skin‚Ä¶what should I do? Help! HB Team Hi my love, please check out the guides we have recommended at the end of the post, they will help you to find the right products for your skin type.

Here is one of my fav masks I use when my skin is a little dry and I swear it will make your skin feel soooo much better: INGREDIENTS 4 spoonfuls of yogurt (plain, try get the organic one) 1 spoonful of honey (also try use organic) Mix the ingredients together in a bowl, if you have time place it in the fridge for 30 minutes. Then apply to your face using your fingers. Let sit for 10-15 minutes and rinse with luke warm water. Follow with your favorite moisturizer, Voila!

If you haven‚Äôt realized it yet and it‚Äôs pretty obvious, this gorgeous goddess was destined for fame. In her short time she has opened several companies, launched numerous products and is endorsing everything from makeup to salads. Let‚Äôs face it, whether you love her or love to hate her, she is hot. Just how hot? She has been regarded as one of the hottest women in Hollywood. After meeting her in LA, I realized the dazzlising dash-doll is just as sweet as she is sweetfaced. From impeccable style, to a killer bod, Kimmy K is here to stay. RESPECT!! She will be releasing two calenders next year, one as a blond and one as a brunette. Here are some sneak peaks from her 2011 calender as a brunette.

According to Rosacea.org, well over 14 million Americans suffer from Rosecea and have no idea that they have it. If left untreated, Rosecea can worsen with age. Here are warning signs that you may have Rosecea: ‚Ä¢ Redness on cheeks, nose, chin, or forehead ‚Ä¢ Small visible blood vessels on face ‚Ä¢ Bumpy or rough patches sometimes with pimples ‚Ä¢ Watery or irritated eyes The cause of Rosacea is currently unknown, and while there are no proven cures, it is possible to control the symptons. Prescription antibiotics in the form of pills or topical ointments, may help the signs of Rosacea and usually are effective. However, if medicine does fail, try using sulfer creams for Rosacea. These are usually extremely successful and typically avoid any complications that could occur while taking antibiotics. It is recommended that you consult your dermatologist about what method is right for you. The following information is taken directly from skincarephysicians.com RosaceaNet Article Controlling Flare-Ups Can Boost Self-Esteem Another study that involved 583 patients with mild to moderate rosacea found that effective treatment significantly improved the patients‚Äô quality of life. The type of treatment did not matter. As long as it was effective, patients‚Äô quality of life improved. While rosacea is not curable, flare-ups can often be controlled by following the three-prong approach recommended by dermatologists: ¬∑ Skin care. Following a rosacea friendly skin care plan is essential. This includes being very gentle with rosacea-prone skin, using mild skin care products, and protecting the skin from the sun. ¬∑ Treatment. The treatment prescribed depends on the type and severity of the rosacea. Combination therapy is often most effective. Treatment may include a barrier-repair emollient, topical medications, and/or laser therapy. ¬∑ Trigger avoidance. What triggers rosacea in one person may not cause another person to experience a flare-up. Learning personal triggers and finding ways to avoid them can be very effective.

Rosacea Triggers Dermatologists‚Äô Tips for Controlling Rosacea in Fall Fall brings relief for many people with rosacea. Cooler temperatures and reduced humidity in areas across the United States mean less chance of becoming overheated. Even in the fall, it is important to be wary of rosacea triggers and to avoid your own personal triggers. These dermatologists‚Äô tips can help your skin feel better this autumn. ¬∑ Continue to practice sun protection. While the days are getting shorter, sun protection is still essential. A survey conducted by the National Rosacea Society found that sun exposure was the most common trigger among those surveyed. Be sure to limit your exposure to the sun, wear sunglasses that protect your eyes from both the UVA and UVB rays of the sun, apply a broad-spectrum (offers UVA and UVB protection) sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher every day, and wear protective clothing, such as a wide-brimmed hat. ¬∑ Heed cool-down strategies. You can still become overheated when the temperature drops. Activities such as raking leaves, baking a pie, and exercising can cause you to overheat. Cool-down strategies that can help keep a flare-up at bay in the fall are listed on this page. ¬∑ Moisturize if your skin starts to feel dry. When the humidity drops, skin can feel especially dry. A gentle moisturizer can help your skin feel better. To avoid irritating your skin, look for a moisturizer that does not contain alcohol, eucalyptus, fragrance, peppermint, or witch hazel. According to a survey conducted by the National Rosacea Society, these ingredients are more likely to aggravate rosacea. If you use a topical rosacea medication, let this dry before applying the moisturizer. If you cannot find a moisturizer that does not irritate your skin, be sure to ask your dermatologist for recommendations. ¬∑ Avoid getting too close to a burning fire or stove. The first fire of the season can be alluring. Remember not to get too close as getting overheated triggers rosacea for many. ¬∑ Keep the thermostat low. A bit of heat on a chilly autumn night feels great. To avoid becoming overheated, be sure to keep the thermostat low ‚Äî just enough to take the chill out of the air. ¬∑ Avoid steam, saunas, hot showers, and hot baths. Staying cool helps keep rosacea from flaring. Since steam, saunas, and hot water all increase blood flow, these are best avoided. ¬∑ Wear loose, layered clothing. This allows you to stay comfortable because you can remove layers as needed to prevent overheating. ¬∑ Limit hot beverages and alcohol. Heated beverages, such as hot cider, coffee, and tea trigger rosacea for many people. Drinking alcohol also can trigger rosacea. If any of these trigger your rosacea, be sure to limit your consumption or avoid the beverages that cause your rosacea to flare.

Elnett Hairspray by hudabeauty Wed, 17 Mar 2010 Leave a comment Terrified of hairspray? Well, you may not be the only one. I noticed that anytime I pull a can of hairspray out of my makeup kit, people give the I-will pop-you-if-you-think-you‚Äôre-getting-near-me-with-that-can look. While, I understand their pain, I simply cannot avoid using hairspray at times. Thank God there was a genius at L‚ÄôOreal who invented this amazing product! Elnett Satin Hairspray is by far the most revolutionary hairspray that gives you extra hold, but brushes out like it was never there. This product has been featured in European versions of Elle, Vogue, and other beauty and fashion magazines and has been the premier choice of fashion weeks all over Europe. Even long before it was released in the states, it was paraded in almost beauty bible‚Äìyes, it was torture waiting for it to hit stateside! Available at almost every pharmacy and grocery store in Dubai and now available at Target in the states, everyone can get their high fashion without the stiffness of most hairsprays!

The brush resembles the ‚Äútiered‚Äù couture dresses from the House of Dior . This mascara seriously adds volume. The dual fibers work together to create volume that is unparell to any other mascara. The formula includes Black Pearl pigments that give the mascara an extra 3D effect that boost volume up to 50%. The patented SR38 helps promote healthier fuller lashes and also reconstruct damaged lashes. A mascara that gives you full gorgeous lashes that promotes lash health? Wow, sounds too good to be true!

My Nighttime skincare regime (you can check it out here ) takes at least 15 minutes of ensuring my makeup is all gone and my skin is prepped with all the vitamins and moisture it needs to hydrate and feed itself for the next 8 hours‚Ä¶ well, more like 6! But I also have a ton of beauty products on my nightstand that I use every night. Check out my essential seven: Mario Badescu Facial Spray With Aloe, Herbs And Rose Water, $7 This refreshing mist is perfect just before bed, it‚Äôs super hydrating and is packed with natural ingredients to boost radiance and keep oily skin at bay for ‚ÄòI woke up like this‚Äô skin. Shop it here . Margaret Dabbs Foot Hygiene Cream, $27 Your feet have a tough job, the least you can do is give them some TLC. I swear by this rich cream, which is so creamy and also antifungal, anti-bacterial, and anti-inflammatory, so it neutralizes any foot odor. Shop it here . This Works Deep Sleep Pillow Spray, $29 I love this sleeping potion! It uses lavender, patchouli, and chamomile essential oils to help you unwind and relax. It legit makes me fall asleep in minutes, and I love the mini version for taking on flights with me. Shop it here . Caudalie Divine Oil, $49 I live and breathe this oil, it‚Äôs my favorite oil I‚Äôve ever used, and it‚Äôs just so skin softening, plus it smells ahhhhmazing. Shop it here . La Mer The Lip Balm, $60 This lip balm is very expensive, but one pot generally lasts me a year. I have never used another lip balm like it; it stays on all night and intensely hydrates with a magical complex of deep sea extracts. I would also recommend Lanolips as a cheaper alternative (check out my Lanolips review here ). Shop it here . The Chemistry Brand Hand Chemistry, $22 The very last thing I do before I sleep is apply this super nutritious hand elixir. The balm-like formula improves skin‚Äôs firmness, elasticity, texture, hydration, and evenness, and it‚Äôs also lightened my dark knuckles ‚Äì you‚Äôll notice the difference in just weeks! Shop it here . The Super Elixir Sleep Welle Fortified Calming Tea Caddy, $67 I‚Äôve always loved drinking chamomile tea in the evening, and this blend of skullcap herb, valerian root, and hops is the perfect hot drink to relax you before bed, it tastes good too! Shop it here . And, just because my hands get dry easily, sometimes I wear these amazing gloves from Bed Bath &amp; Beyond ‚Äì I apply my hand cream and then put these on and they make my hands insanely soft when I wake up.

What it is : A brush-on, peel-off treatment mask to firm and tone skin. What it does : Helps to lift, tone, and tighten skin. What we liked : We loved that this comes with a mini brush that easily spreads this gooey, marshmallow-like mask over our skin. Just make sure you avoid the eye area, brows, and hair line since it might be tricky to peel off from those areas. This mask felt otherworldy ‚Äì it could have been that it sets to a brilliant, Tin Man-chrome, or maybe the light coconut-ey scent got to us. Whatever the case, after 30 minutes, the mask easily (and not painfully!) peels off to what we felt after a few uses was a brighter, tighter result. What we didn‚Äôt like : Admittedly, it took a few go‚Äôs for us to really appreciate it (and because we might have mistakenly tried to wash it off the first time instead of peeling it off ‚Äì it is water-soluble so it did dissolve but after a few minutes of scrubbing over the sink). Our skin did feel more behaved and glowing after peeling off ‚Äì we‚Äôre not entirely sure if it was the silver residue from the chrome. That said, ‚Äúsexy contours‚Äù might be overstating it. Basically, don‚Äôt expect miracles but it is a good mask for a weekly reset‚Ä¶and your next Instagram pic.

As you can probably guess, I couldn‚Äôt wait to test out Jen‚Äôs first foray into hair and body with her Ouai Rose Hair and Body Oil. What it is: A deliciously scented, versatile oil that can be used on, yep you guessed it, your hair and body! The unique blend of oils are super nourishing: shea oil and absinthium oil hydrate, while rose hip oil will help to reduce scars and redness. Notes of lychee, cedarwood, and bergamot, add to the ahhhmazing fragrance. What it does: Straight, wavy, curly, coiled, whatever your hair is, this oil will werk it! For your hair, the oil fights frizz, nourishes, and gives a silky, high-gloss finish. It hydrates dry, dull skin, adding softness while giving a gorgeous glow. What we liked: It‚Äôs literally the most delicious smelling oil ever, or as Jen puts it, it will make you ‚Äúsmell like you own a yacht.‚Äù I LOVE this for my hair; it gave me really similar results to the Ouai hair oil I usually use, which is really incredible. I combined two sprays with my conditioner then rinsed my hair, and it left my hair feeling so incredibly soft and smooth, I didn‚Äôt even need to add any serum afterward. I think this will be especially great for people with coarse hair, as it will manage and tame your hair without being greasy. For my skin, the texture is super light, it‚Äôs extra softening, and I found that it hydrated even after I had applied it, so it didn‚Äôt just sit on top of my skin, but it really soaked deep into the epidermis. What we didn‚Äôt like: Nothing! The only thing for me is that I prefer to use a heavier oil on my body, like Caudalie Divine Oil (although I wouldn‚Äôt put it on my hair), but that‚Äôs a personal preference as I have very dry skin. That said, this is heavenly, and I love that I can use this for everything if I need to. Overall, I really like this for the body, but I absolutely love it for my hair! I can honestly say Jen has the best hair products I‚Äôve ever used in my life, and I would 100% recommend this!

You‚Äôd be pretty excited, right? It‚Äôs no exaggeration to say that after Huda introduced the HB HQ to it, we swiftly switched up our beauty routines to include miracle-worthy micellar water. No, it‚Äôs not a fancy bottle of H20 from our basement, it‚Äôs the lazy girl‚Äôs dream to cleansing! But don‚Äôt take our word for it, it‚Äôs a staple arsenal in every makeup artists‚Äô kit, and renowned to be a favorite among models and celebrities. Even the lifelong makeup remover wipe devotees among you will be converted! So, what actually is micellar water? Surprise, surprise, it‚Äôs another genius beauty product created by the French. Micellar water is made of tiny balls of oil molecules called micelles, which are suspended in soft water. The clever little micelles are made of surfactants, which act as magnet to attract dirt, makeup, and sebum, lifting impurities from the skin without stripping away natural oils like harsh chemicals and alcohol can. All you need to do is soak a cotton pad in micellar water and wipe away your makeup (even tough eye-makeup) and any other grime or oil that has built up ‚Äì no need to rinse because the formula draws out impurities without unbalancing your skin, and doesn‚Äôt leave behind oil. As a result, it‚Äôs incredibly hydrating for your skin, so if your skin tends to be oily, you may even find you can skip moisturizing before bed. It‚Äôs super gentle formula makes it ideal for sensitive skin, as you can avoid oil-stripping face washes and there‚Äôs no need to rub or scrub your skin. If you‚Äôre a bb cream and mascara kinda girl, this will soon become your go-to when you don‚Äôt have the energy to wash your face. If you‚Äôre part of the oily-skinned crew or a cake face fan, you‚Äôll need a few cotton pads to remove the layers, or wash your face and let a quick wipe of micellar water do the rest. No doubt you‚Äôll notice a huge change in your complexion the longer you use it, and dewy skin from your first use. HB HQ is never without Bioderma‚Äôs Sensibio H20 Micelle Solution ‚Äì the original French formula to spark the trend among the beauty world ‚Äì and their super cute mini versions make the perfect cleansing option for traveling! There‚Äôs a ton of options for every budget, some even contain ingredients like rose water to soothe, hibiscus to brighten, or vitamins. Our fave drugstore micellar waters include the incredibly affordable Garnier Micellar Cleansing Water and Simple‚Äôs award-winning Cleansing Micellar Water , which has vitamins B3 and C, and costs less than $6! best cleansing method cleansing micellar water Sensitive skin Sat, 5 Aug 2017 12 Comments Related Posts How Your Cleanser Could Be Ruining Your Skin, And‚Ä¶ Sun, 27 Aug 2017 The Drugstore Product Every Lazy Girl Should Have Sun, 23 Jul 2017 Your Skin Is Thirsty For This $9 French Beauty Essential Fri, 19 May 2017 Naina Hey, would you recommend micellar water for acne prone skin?

No matter how many scrubs I try, I keep finding myself going back to the Soap &amp; Glory Smoothie Star Breakfast Scrub , $15; it literally sloughs away every last bit of dead skin. Unlike some scrubs that can make your skin oily without really scrubbing, this one will actually exfoliate your skin and leave it crazy clean. It‚Äôs not super softening, but it‚Äôs one of my all-time faves because it just gets the job done; be sure to follow with a moisturizer. I also love that it uses amazing natural ingredients like oats, honey, and bananas ‚Äì I know, it sounds delicious, like some yummy maple syrup pudding. Oats are surprisingly good for your skin; they contain amino acids that can heal damaged skin and even target blemishes. Bananas and honey are also incredible natural ingredients that are loaded with good-for-your-skin vitamins and have anti-bacterial properties. With the added benefits of shea butter, almond oil, sea salt, and brown sugar, it‚Äôs basically a huge tub of food for your skin! I find with a scrub you need to use a good amount, or the exfoliation isn‚Äôt the same, and because this tub is huge, you can use a lot every time without having to worry about saving it (unlike when you have an expensive scrub, and you skimp, because you spent so much money on it)! DIY Your Own Breakfast Scrub! I love this scrub so much I‚Äôve even recreated it myself. It‚Äôs a little bit messy, but it‚Äôs totally worth it. For your face: Mash up half a ripe banana with a fork and combine it with two tablespoons of organic oats and about a teaspoon of honey. Combine the mix and then smother your face with it. I like to gently rub it onto my skin for exfoliation (over the sink, as the oats can fall off), and then I leave it on my face for around fifteen minutes. For your body: Mash up one ripe banana, and combine with half a cup of brown sugar, half a cup of oatmeal, and two tablespoons of coconut oil. Jump in the shower, plaster your body with the scrub (I always go in sections, my arms, my body, my legs) and rub in circular motions ‚Äì this usually takes me a good few minutes. Rinse thoroughly with water and pat your skin dry. DIY body scrub drugstore body scrub Soap &amp; Glory Tue, 19 Sep 2017 11 Comments Related Posts DIY Face Scrub for Glowing Skin!

I‚Äôve been drinking collagen for about 12 months so far, and I‚Äôve noticed a huge impact on my skin and my body; it‚Äôs pretty incredible. Collagen (or gelatin) is a naturally occurring protein in your body, but as you age your body produces less, which leads to wrinkles, sagging skin, and joint pain ‚Äì not ideal! What is collagen: Collagen is one of the building blocks of skin, so not only does it keep you looking young but it can heal your skin as well ‚Äì seriously, it‚Äôs true! It helps to heal acne scars and scarring, as collagen mends and rebuilds the damage done to connective tissue, while it‚Äôll also improve your bone strength and ligaments in the same way. The most noticeable difference I‚Äôve seen from drinking collagen is the effect it has on wrinkles; because collagen strengthens blood vessels, it makes your skin softer, more elastic and prevents and fixes fine lines, (even pimples). Because collagen improves skin tissue strength and helps the body to replace dead skin cells, it promotes glossier hair, stronger fingernails, and firmer skin. And finally, and I have noticed this myself, it reduces the appearance of cellulite because it rebuilds the fibers that make cellulite more visible ‚Äì insane! Where collagen comes from: So, if you‚Äôre wondering where collagen comes from, it‚Äôs basically derived from the bones and tissue of animals like cows, fish, chicken, and pigs. But not all collagen is created equal; you need to look into the source of collagen (which animal), as this can determine the effect it will have on your body and its potency ‚Äì beef and fish are the best. The most effective type of collagen is marine collagen because it‚Äôs absorbed up to 1.5 times more efficiently into the body than any other type of collagen. How to take collagen: When I first heard about collagen, I started taking it in a pill form, and I noticed a small difference: my skin looked lifted, and my skin felt smoother. But when I started taking it as a powder, about 12 months ago, that‚Äôs when I noticed a significant difference in the texture of my skin. Even my scars have faded, and I swear my double chin has got tighter! I‚Äôll admit, in its powder form, collagen doesn‚Äôt taste great ‚Äì it‚Äôs meant to be flavorless, but I feel like it has a kind of meaty taste to it. You can mix it with tea, smoothies, coffee or even add it to meals you‚Äôre prepping. I like to mix it with soup or hot chicken broth, which is a healthy way of having it and you don‚Äôt notice it at all. Depending on the formula you‚Äôre taking, different amounts are recommended. I use the Great Lakes Gelatin Collagen Hydrolysate Beef , and it recommends two tablespoons twice a day, which you can dissolve in almost anything, but I usually only have it once a day. I‚Äôve also heard amazing things about ProPlenish Marine Collagen , which comes in sachets that also include some of the best-for-your-body vitamins and minerals. You can try collagen from aged 25 onwards when your body‚Äôs natural collagen supply begins to decrease. For me, it‚Äôs become an essential part of my daily beauty routine ‚Äì I‚Äôm obsessed!

So many young girls use this name up and a lot of it when it will only damage their skin in time so what‚Äôs the point of this supplement? Why not have a great diet and use natural products? My point made! These magic drinks alone don‚Äôt do a thing without the basics i.e. Good sleep, drinking water etc HB Team Hi gorgeous, we totally agree! Drinking plenty of water, a healthy and balanced diet, and exercise are all very important, but collagen is an additional supplement that really does do wonders for your skin!

Well, that‚Äôs where you can go SO wrong ‚Äì a badly chosen formula and careless application can actually cause breakouts and skin sagging. Seriously, there‚Äôs a method of getting the most from your moisturizer, and it‚Äôs all about getting the time, formula, and technique just right. Don‚Äôt worry though, we‚Äôve got you covered; if you follow these steps you‚Äôll be getting so much more from your moisturizer, and you‚Äôll see the difference in your skin in no time at all. Pick the right moisturizer for your skin type All moisturizers are made up of three types of ingredients: occlusives, which protect your skin and retain moisture; emollients which repair damaged skin cells, and humectants, like glycerin, which increase the water content in the skin. Every product will have a different combination of these three formulas so that they can target different layers of your skin. So, the first step to picking the right moisturizer is knowing your skin type , and then finding a formula to complement it ‚Äì check out our guide to choosing a moisturizer here . Don‚Äôt pull on your skin Be gentle with your face cream, if you rub too hard you‚Äôll create friction between your skin and hands, causing the water content to evaporate before it‚Äôs even started replenishing. Pulling the skin in a downwards motion can also lead to premature wrinkles and even saggy skin over time. Instead, apply your moisturizer gently in a circular, upward motion, and for your eye area, pat gently with your ring finger. When you‚Äôre done, you should have a slight glow, give this final layer time to absorb before applying any other products. Apply routinely It seems logical to only hydrate when your skin is dry, but if it already reaches this stage, there‚Äôs likely to be a layer of dead skin cells on the surface, making it harder for the product to reach your skin. When your skin is dry, it produces more sebum to lubricate itself, which means you‚Äôll likely end up with sebum build up as well. If you‚Äôre guilty of under moisturizing, make sure you exfoliate before moisturizing to remove any dead skin cell build-up. Aim to moisturize twice a day, once in the morning after washing your face with warm water, and in the evening 30 minutes before you sleep; so that it doesn‚Äôt rub off or get absorbed into your pillow . Moisturize oily skin Don‚Äôt get sucked into the trap of thinking that if your skin is oily or acne-prone, it doesn‚Äôt need moisturizer. If you don‚Äôt hydrate your skin, you‚Äôll trigger your body to produce even more sebum (the natural oil that‚Äôs the main culprit for its greasy layer). The secret is to look for lightweight, gel formulas that are non-comedogenic with key ingredients like retinol, glycolic acid, and salicylic acid. Don‚Äôt apply too much If you over-moisturize your skin you‚Äôll quickly become dependant on it for moisture, and sebum levels can decrease ‚Äì without the natural oil to keep your skin soft and supple, it‚Äôll only look dull and tired. Applying more product doesn‚Äôt mean your skin will absorb more; if you use too much product you‚Äôll end up with a thick layer of product that could clog your pores and lead to breakouts. Switch it up We all have a favorite moisturizer, but the fact is you need to switch it up regularly to see good results all year round. The effectiveness of your moisturizer can plateau if your skin gets used to the ingredients, and as the seasons change and hormones fluctuate. It‚Äôs essential that you rotate products with different primary active ingredients, so you can experience the benefits of each. So, if you‚Äôre currently using a cream packed with AHA ‚Äôs or a hydrating serum, switch to something that‚Äôs retinol based. For nighttime, especially if your skin is dry or aging, consider a richer formula, as this is when your skin loses more moisture. moisturizer moisturizer mistakes Skincare Thu, 28 Dec 2017 16 Comments Related Posts Where You‚Äôre Going Wrong With Your Moisturizer And‚Ä¶ Tue, 10 Oct 2017 How Your Cleanser Could Be Ruining Your Skin, And‚Ä¶ Sun, 27 Aug 2017 The Skincare Step You Should Never Skip If You Want‚Ä¶ Mon, 30 Oct 2017 Cindy Collins How‚Äôs often should we be switching out moisturizers?

And I‚Äôve been doing that but it‚Äôs like when I don‚Äôt put on moisturizer my skin is so dull and flakey. Now I know why it‚Äôs because I‚Äôve been patting on TOO much product. And I‚Äôve been using the same moisturizer for practically my whole life. And Ive felt like moisturizer doesn‚Äôt do anything for my skin it‚Äôs just a temporary effect till it‚Äôs all absorbed and then my skin is back to its dry flakey self. Now I know I need to change it up to see lasting results. This post is literally life changing for me. Thanks a million Nida Thank you so much Huda it helps me a lot. I‚Äôve dry/sensitive skin and sometimes I confused in choosing face oils can you please please tell me which face oil I should use. I‚Äôm from Pakistan Hamda Saqib Yes the right type of moisturiser is the key. I had breakouts 3 years ago just because of using excessive and a thick layer of moisturiser. But then i shifted to natural oils , three drops on each cheek , and that worked for me. I suggest Huda Beauty to launch their own skincare line for all skin types. . Jaiwanti kumar Valuable tips!

The beige, taupe-brown and black are the perfect shade for created that smokey eye. Go all over with the taupe-brown for an all day sexy look, or use the black with brown on the crease for a dramatic smokey eye that will make you feel like a diva. The formulas are also super silky and stay on blend incredibly well. For all day wear, use with a eyeshadow primer like MAC Paints in Base . Use all together and enjoy the sexiest smokey eye you will find in a kit! Available at Sephora ‚Äì H.Kattan in product review Controlling that Shine! by hudabeauty Wed, 7 Apr 2010 4 Comments Huda I need your help! What do you recommend for oily skin?! Sometimes my skin is super dry then after a long day of makeup, some areas get oily. And hate breakouts! What should I use? ‚ô• Hey baby! Yes, breakouts are the worst! Whenever I suffer from any breakouts I always avoid using any oil-based products like foundation and some concealers. If your skin feels dry early on, you may want to adjust your facial regiment. Drier weather can call for the use of moisturizers that are a little more intense. One that I love and it seems to work on all my clients no matter what the climate and skin type is Kiehls Ultra Moisturizer. It‚Äôs formula is not too thick, yet it provides intense moisture http://www.kiehls.com/_us/ _en/face/moisturizers/ultr a-facial-moisturizer.htm . I would then switch to a mineral foundation, like MAC Mineralize foundation http://www.maccosmetics.co m/product/spp.tmpl?CATEGOR Y_ID=CAT158&amp;PRODUCT_ID=168 5 , seriously love this product! I would avoid using any liquid foundations if you are prone to breakouts. As for controlling the oil during the day, my favorite blotting sheets, and this is totally necessary if your skin starts looking shiny during the day (like mine), are the Shiseido blotting sheets. The Rosemary extract and Zinc Oxide in these blotting sheets keep your skin from looking oily again and also prevent breakouts http://sephora.com/browse/ product.jhtml?id=P173647&amp;s houldPaginate=true&amp;categor yId=5337#moreInfo ! Seriously a wonder worker! I know it seems like a lot, but I use to struggle with breakouts pretty bad. Until I understood what worked best with my skin, I was pretty much spotted, which was NOT fun! But now I feel like I have control because I use the right products and it‚Äôs liberating! Try this doll and let me know how this works!

You can go easy on the foundation, get rid of the false lashes, but a good brow is an essential ‚Äì it‚Äôs the best way to frame your face. So, if you want to keep your look to a minimum, think a nude lip, a good coating of mascara, a dusting of bronzer and highlighter, and a bold brow!

The problem is all the heating in our homes and offices makes the air really dry, which plays havoc with our delicately balanced skin, hair, and lips. So, to keep your lips protected ‚Äì chapped lips can be seriously painful ‚Äì we‚Äôve got three tips to make sure your pout stays as gorgeous as ever, even when it‚Äôs cold af outside! Fix your surroundings Do what you can to make the air around you as hydrating as possible. Invest in, or dig out your humidifier ‚Äì it will add moisture to the air, which will benefit your skin, lips, and hair as well. The heated vapor produced by humidifiers also kills 90% if the bacteria and spores in the air, so you‚Äôre less likely to catch an annoying cold. We found a humidifier on Amazon for $18 , which also diffuses essential oils ‚Äì bonus! Prevent chapping Stop your lips from chapping in the first place and always keep a lip balm to hand. Look for lip balms with lanolin in, a highly moisturizing natural ingredient that comes from sheep‚Äôs fleeces (it can hold 200% it‚Äôs weight in water!). And always ensure that you apply lip balm before bed, so your lips don‚Äôt go without added moisture all night. Lanolips has to be our all-time favorite lip balm for combatting chapped lips, it‚Äôs super protecting, and one layer lasts all day (check out the full review here ). Another lip balm we‚Äôve been obsessed with for years is Carmex; not only does it contain lanolin, but also beeswax, shea butter, and Aloe Vera, which work together to heal chapped lips and prevent future drying. It also costs less than $2! DIY lip mask We love using natural ingredients to heal our skin, and honey is one of our fav ingredients because of its moisturizing, hydrating, and repairing properties. It‚Äôs also antibacterial, which means it‚Äôll help to prevent any infection that can occur when your lips get dry. You can apply pure honey as a mask to your lips for 15 minutes, before gently wiping it (or licking it) away. You can also make a lip oil by combining a teaspoon of honey with a teaspoon of sweet almond oil; stir the mix well and store it in a small plastic container or lip tin so you can use it throughout the day. dry lips honey mask Lip Care lip mask Wed, 13 Dec 2017 2 Comments Related Posts The Ultimate Hack for Super Soft Lips Sun, 28 May 2017 This Is What You Need To Do For Sexy Smooth Skin In Winter Wed, 8 Nov 2017 Sheep‚Äôs Wool for Softer Lips?!

Exactly. So when our hair needs serious TLC post-color, we turned to her Ouai Hair Treatment Masques for some damage control. Here‚Äôs what we thought: What it is : This pack comes with eight treatment doses (meant to be used twice a week), to restore and heal hair in a matter of minutes: What it does : Uses ingredients like artichoke leaf extract and jojoba to nourish and repair strands. Just apply to hair, comb through with your fingers, wait 5 to 10 minutes, and then rinse out. What we liked : Our ends were seriously parched from over-styling and color. This mask is bringing it back to life. After one use, we noticed much softer, bouncier ends without feeling the least bit weighed down. We also like to apply to our ends before a long gym session so we‚Äôre ready to go once we hit the shower. The light floral scent that makes the treatment feel extra luxurious. What we didn‚Äôt like : The amount felt right for shorter hair, but we can imagine it takes more than one if you have super long and thick hair.

There‚Äôs not a girl in France who isn‚Äôt using this incredibly simple product in their beauty routine. We‚Äôve got the proof too‚Ä¶ Three bottles are sold every second in France. And why do we want it so badly? It‚Äôs brilliance in a bottle, inexpensive, and let‚Äôs be honest, when it comes to beauty, French gals really know their stuff ‚Äì they actually spend twice as much as their English neighbors do on skincare. The awesome phenomenon? Av√®ne Thermal Water Spray. It‚Äôs basically magical water that will solve a ton of your beauty woes! Spritz it on before makeup, after cleansing or showering, after an intense yoga or gym workout, while you travel, and even on sunburn or wounds. OR you know, because summer is coming and spraying a cold mist on your face is refreshing as hell ‚Äì and BTW it won‚Äôt mess with your makeup either, you can even use it to help set your cake face and give it a luminous look. It‚Äôs the perfect way to keep your skin fresh and hydrated, while it soothes redness and itchiness and even protects your skin from harmful free radicals that enhance the damage from UV rays. Plus, there‚Äôs not a single nasty chemical in it, it has a neutral PH balance of 7.5, so it‚Äôs amazing for sensitive skin. AND it leaves your skin feeling ridiculously soft ‚Äì it seems crazy because it‚Äôs just water, but honestly, there‚Äôs something in it! Which brings us on to the one and only ingredient, Av√®ne Thermal Spring Water. Av√®ne has been famous for its incredible healing properties for over 270 years, and just recently they discovered a unique microflora in the water (that calms itching and irritations), which along with all its mineral properties make it a unique source of water unlike any other in the world. Add to that it‚Äôs rich in silicates that soften skin, it has the perfect ratio of calcium and magnesium to improve skin texture, and trace elements that even restore the epidermal barrier ‚Äì it‚Äôs a pretty supernatural source of water. Take its incredible hydrating and soothing effects to another level and soak two cotton pads in Av√®ne and place them over your eyes, which BTW, feels like heaven after a night out! Or, soak a facial tissue with Av√®ne and let it rest on your face for ten minutes ‚Äì sounds like the easiest facial we‚Äôve ever heard of! Want a can to take with you everywhere? Get it at Av√®ne here . We‚Äôll just be waiting patiently for them to bottle it in liters so we can take showers in it. *Image courtesy of Av√®ne avene avene thermal spring water facial spray Fri, 19 May 2017 5 Comments Related Posts The Best Thing For Your Skin Is Completely Free Tue, 25 Jul 2017 This Is No Ordinary Water: Why Micellar Water Will‚Ä¶ Sat, 5 Aug 2017 This Amazing DIY Ingredient Is The Beyonce Of The‚Ä¶ Sat, 4 Nov 2017 avene √ºr√ºnleri I‚Äôve heard good things about this avene product‚Ä¶ Going on my wish list now‚Ä¶.. üôÇ Cheemsy25 I just order it today üôÇ I cant wait to use it !

It‚Äôs one of those frustrating things that we thought we‚Äôd be able to leave behind with the overly plucked eyebrows and pencil cases of our school days. Sadly, acne doesn‚Äôt disappear with age, and it‚Äôll pop up no matter how much we seem to spend on skincare and pimple solutions. The thing is, it‚Äôs really hard to understand what‚Äôs causing your acne and decipher what‚Äôs best for your skin without being a skincare expert. Fortunately, we know queen of skincare and legend in her field, our wonderful surgical dermatologist, Dr. Doris Day. Recently, we asked you to send your beauty problems to our incredible Panel of Experts , and now we have the answers to the questions you wanted to know: from acne scars and combination skin to supplements and anti-aging. Here‚Äôs Dr. Doris Day‚Äôs expert opinion on the things every pimple-popper should know: How can you keep acne-prone skin balanced? Many people have skin that is oily but also dehydrated, and this is often made worse by many acne medications, which are drying to the skin. The key is to use hydrators and to stay hydrated. Look for ingredients like hyaluronic acid to help add and hold water in the skin without clogging pores. An easy way to know if a moisturizer is going to hydrate without adding to acne is by looking for these words on the label: non-comedogenic or non-acnegenic. Oil-free is not the same thing and it doesn‚Äôt mean it will work for your skin. It‚Äôs also super important to stay hydrated by drinking enough water and eating foods with high water content like fruits and vegetables. This will help your skin and acne from the inside-out! Another important factor is to not over-scrub or over-wash your skin, as this will also dry it out and make acne worse. What are the best ways to remove acne scars? This is a complicated issue because there are different types of acne scars. A true scar is a change in the texture of the skin. This means that if you close your eyes and rub your hands over your skin, you will feel a difference between normal skin and the scar. After acne, there is often discoloration where the skin may be red or hyperpigmented (darker) compared with healthy skin. The discoloration will clear with time and with the right skin care products. Actual scars are harder to treat and take time. Ingredients like retinol are helpful, along with antioxidants like peptides to help the collagen layers of the skin heal and regrow. LED red light can be helpful too, but I would be very careful with dermarollers. The ones available for home use are not deep enough to really help scars and if you don‚Äôt clean them properly they may cause infection or make acne worse. Also, if you have one that is not well-made or not stored properly, some needles could be dull or become dull, and these will also lead to scarring in the skin. Ideally, dermarolling or micro-needling should be done by your dermatologist, they may also add micro-needling with radiofrequency energy, which I have found to be very effective in treating many types of acne scars and in a broad range of skin types. Do not use a derma-roller on suntanned skin, as that may also lead to severe discoloration. What are the best moisturizers for acne-prone skin? The best thing is to look for ones tested for acne prone skin. These will have on the label: non-comedogenic (the product will not block your pore) or non-acnegenic (the product has been tested for acne-prone skin, and doesn‚Äôt contain fragrances, oils or harsh ingredients that could cause breakouts). Oil free does not mean much, and there are now even oils used to help hydrate skin in acne patients. Look for the same things on the labels to know they are okay for acne-prone skin. Coconut oil, in particular, is very popular right now, and it does have antioxidants and some anti-acne properties, but it is occlusive (creates a greasy layer on skin that prevents water loss through your skin), so I would not recommend it as a moisturizer for most people who have or are prone to acne. How can you treat both acne and aging? For many of my patients, acne starts after their teenage years, so we focus on anti-aging as well as acne. Fortunately many of the treatments I use for acne also help with anti-aging. Ingredients I like are retinol, niacinamide, and hyaluronic acid. Retinol is a vitamin A derivative and helps your skin to produce more collagen and fill fine lines. Though completely different, both Niacinamide (more details below) and hyaluronic acid can work to rewind the aging process and help to improve acne. For the pigmentation that is often left behind, I like tranexamic acid as an ingredient in products that brighten skin, but I also use it in a pill form as well. This should only be taken when under the supervision of your dermatologist. What are the best supplements for improving acne? I LOVE niacinamide. It works to minimize sebum production, brighten and improve skin texture, stimulate collagen, and it‚Äôs anti-inflammatory. Be careful because this is not the same as niacin, so don‚Äôt get them confused. Niacinamide is also great for anti-aging. One formulation I like is called Nicomide (I often recommend two pills per day), it has: Niacinamide 750 mg, Zinc 27 mg, Folate 500 mcg, Copper 2 mg, Selenium 50 mcg, Chromium 100 mcg ‚Äì this is a supplement I prescribe to my patients, and it can‚Äôt be bought over the counter. You can, of course, use Niacinamide by itself and get amazing results. Zinc is another great supplement you can take that‚Äôs great for healing and regulating your immune system, and I do like it as a supplement for acne, especially along with niacinamide and other B vitamins.

KP causes tiny little bumps on your skin that can be confused with spots, and they can appear on your face as well as your arms and body. If it looks like this it could be KP, but you should check with your doctor who should be able to identify it. If it is KP, don‚Äôt worry it‚Äôs not harmful, but you can read our guide here to see how you can improve the appearance of it. xxx Noha Hey, I have a T zone skin where my nose is oily and my cheeks are dry and has many acne scars.

Do as Doris recommends and look for moisturizers that are non-comedogenic, as these won‚Äôt block your pores but will keep your skin hydrated. You could also try my DIY for blackheads on your nose, and remember to exfoliate once or twice a week. I also think clay masks are brilliant for extracting dirt from your pores, so try to do a clay mask once a week two. Good luck, hope this helps üòÄ xxx Chidy Beautiful. Thank you both.

It‚Äôs literally the ONLY film on our agenda; it gives us aaaall the festive feels and makes us all warm and fuzzy on the inside. So, break out the face masks, grab some gingerbread, and crack open the eggnog for the ultimate holiday night in. Even those of you who claim you don‚Äôt like Christmas, we swear if you watch this film you‚Äôll be singing Mariah, nonstop, for the next month. Here‚Äôs why‚Ä¶ 1. The ICONIC opening scene is so uplifting because it reminds us of what is truly important in life ‚Äì our nearest and dearest. 2. It‚Äôs real, it cuts out the BS and the fairytales, and it tells the true stories of life, love, and heartbreak. 3. The soundtrack makes us dance pretty much exactly like this: 4. It has all our MAJOR girl crushes ‚Äì errrr hello Claudia Schiffer. 5. The extra AF gift wrapping cracks us up every time, but it does actually highlight an important rule: gorgeous gift-wrapping is almost as important as the present ‚Äì it shows you‚Äôve made the effort! 6. It teaches us that although love can be total agony, sometimes it‚Äôll work out exactly how you want it to. 7. It inspires us to make a grand romantic gesture to win over our crush. 8. It makes you realize that family is everything, actually. 9. It‚Äôs an emotional rollercoaster of tears, triumph and true love. Who else is immediately about to watch this?

Here‚Äôs how: First off, start with a smooth canvas by exfoliating your lips ‚Äì you can also smear a thick layer of toothpaste on your lips and leave it on for 10 seconds before wiping away, this will exfoliate and add volume to your lips . Next dab a little foundation on your lips with a makeup sponge ‚Äì this will give you a blank canvas to work with. Then contour your lips with a lip liner, I use the Huda Beauty Lip Contour, but I also love Kat Von D‚Äôs Everlasting Lip Liners . Contour done, use a Liquid Matte, or long-lasting liquid lipstick on top, et voila ‚Äì you‚Äôre ready to start and finish the day with a killer pout. My pro tip is to dab a highlighter powder or a little shimmer at the center of your lips to add dimension and make your lips appear fuller. P.S. Lipstick isn‚Äôt everything, but it‚Äôs a good way to start the day üòâ A post shared by Huda Kattan (@hudabeauty) on May 4, 2016 at 8:09am PDT lip contouring Liquid Matte long lasting lipstick National Lipstick Day Sat, 15 Jul 2017 2 Comments Related Posts A Beginner‚Äôs Guide to Lip Contouring A Plumper Pout Mon, 8 May 2017 Is This The Best Matte Lipstick, EVER?!

Tips for a Brighter Smile! by hudabeauty Wed, 21 Apr 2010 Leave a comment Anyone have this issue? Their teeth have lost their luster and are looking a tad on the yellow side? After moving overseas, I started to appreciate American dental practices. Okay, appreciate is the wrong word, I became obsessed with having a brighter smile. Let‚Äôs face it, it‚Äôs inevitable that our teeth will naturally stain as we age due to food, drinks and lifestyle choices. Nevertheless, it is possible to acquire and maintain a bright smile‚Äìthese are some common practices that have worked for me. Teeth Whitening I have tried several methods including Zoom whitening at the dentist, whitening kits, whitening toothpastes and mouthwash. I have found the most effective for me was actually the kits. I like the Crest Whitening Strips . Not only are they affordable and effective, but if used properly, they were the most gentle. Zoom caused so much pain for me at times my teeth became sensitive to air! Not fun! Furthermore, you can control how bright you want to go with the kit. I noticed a difference after three days with Crest Whitening Strips and I could barely tell the difference in the before-and-after photos with the Zoom whitening. Only downfall of the strips: They don‚Äôt cover you entire mouth (only your dentist will notice) and they can be a bit time consuming. If you‚Äôre a bit old fashioned and prefer the baking-soda-with-your-toothpaste-routine, then here are some foods that also add light to your smile: Celery Apples Pears Carrots Remember to rinse your mouth with water after eating dark foods and beverages! This will tremendously help reduce stains and easy to do!

In case you haven‚Äôt, it‚Äôs time to get familiar! f you are a makeup or fashion lover of any sort, chances are, you already know her work. She is ubiquitously featured in Vogue Italia, UK, Japan, and Paris as one of the premier makeup artist for their most elite editorials and cover shoots. Want more? She has created some of the most provocative makeups for recent runway shows and ad campaigns for Giambattista Valli, Moschino, and MAC. Oh, did I mention she is the power-house behind the creative designs for YSL makeup? Not too shabby for the Brittish Makeup Artist, who was originally a hair dresser.

And as much as we love our Louboutin‚Äôs, they may not love our feet. Here is an old trick to get the perfect at-home pedi: When soaking your feet, make sure the water is warm, add half a cup of olive oil and half cup dishwasher powder (Ariel works fine as a substitute), soak for at least 15 minutes then scrub with a body scrub like Cuccio Milk and Honey Sea Salt (available at Select Sasha‚Äôs salon or online at cuccio.com). Scrub in circular motions starting from your heels and moving toward your toes. Rinse with warm water. Follow with a pumice stone and foot lotion (Aveda Foot Relief, or Cuccio Milk and Honey Butter Blend) and voila! Buttery-soft-beautiful feet! For best results, try doing this once a week. ‚Äì H.Kattan in Makeup Question from a Fan: Bronze Beauty by hudabeauty Tue, 20 Apr 2010 1 Comment FROM USER: Hi gorgeous! I LOVE YOUR BEAUTY BLOG!!!!!!! Its awesome,, can you give me advice on bronzers and liquid foundation? I was previously using NARS laguna beach bronzer and just a random liquid foundation‚Ä¶any advice would be greatlyyyyyyyyy appreciated üôÇ Thanks dollface! REPLY FROM BEAUTY 411: Hi sweetie!!! So glad you like the blog!!!! üôÇ Great question darling! The foundation of choice for me is MAC Studio Fix Fluid . I seriously love it! I started using it when I had a facial that went wrong right before my wedding and I needed a cover-all foundation. This one does the trick and it‚Äôs actually quite light! No one every thinks I‚Äôm wearing makeup when I wear it, even after those rushed mornings when I apply it with my hands! I also like using the MAC Mineralize SPF Foundation as well for on-the-go (pretty much all the friends I recommended this to that try it, tell me they are so happy with it). Bronzers are a subject that is very much important to me! After having spent a big part of my life sunbathing and realizing that I wrinkle like a raisin, I needed to find an alternative. I have literally tried every bronzer that has ever hit counters (and some that didn‚Äôt). My own personal preference for bronzers has been one that is light and natural. I don‚Äôt fancy shimmer or orange-based bronzers, but that‚Äôs personal preference. If you are looking for a natural bronzer with killer staying power, I HIGHLY recommend Cargo Water Resistant Bronzer . The color is amazingly natural and it looks great on everyone. I keep one for myself and one in my kit when I‚Äôm on set. If you do have a thing for NARS, try Heat. It‚Äôs a pressed powder that works great as a bronzer (it‚Äôs basically Laguna without the shimmer). If shimmer is what you are after, Guerlain makes great shimmery bronzers. My biggest recommendation of all, however, is to wear plenty of SPF! I thinkn it‚Äôs nearly impossible to wear too much, in Dubai anyways! No matter where you are, make sure never to leave home without it! Photo courtesy of YSL -H.Kattan in Makeup , product review Amazing Product Alert!! by hudabeauty Tue, 20 Apr 2010 1 Comment I was walking through one of my favorite department stores this summer and having thought I was very happy with my current mascara, I kindly ignored the pushy sales lady when she suggested I try Smashbox Lash DNA. She finally gave me a sample and boy did my world change! I went back the very next day for three tubes for my sisters! This stuff is amazing! It gives you extreme length, but also just the right amount of thickness. It is super black which makes for a kick ass combination! The secret weapon is the brush; it‚Äôs shaped just perfectly to give you the right volume you‚Äôre looking for. For best results, I recommend using this with a Lash Primer (Makeup Forever Lash Fibers is a good choice), and lengthening mascara (Dior Iconic and Cargo Blue-Ray Mascaras are my favorite), followed by Lash DNA. If you‚Äôre in a hurry, skip the lengthening mascara and go! ‚Äì H.Kattan in beauty Mona Lisa Brows?

But along with the change of wardrobe comes crazy cold weather, the contrasting blast of hot air from central heating, and steaming hot showers to bring us back up to a cozy temperature. And, as great as the rush of warmth might feel, it can cause havoc on our skin. So, to make sure you‚Äôre looking as flawless during the winter months as you do during the summer, here are our top tips and our fav DIYs to keep your skin in prime condition. Humidify It‚Äôs winter, it‚Äôs cold, and all we want is to be at home binging on Stranger Things under the duvet with the heating on full blast ‚Äì preferably with some hot cocoa to hand. And, although this seems like the perfect solution to the winter weather, the dry air from heating majorly dehydrates skin, so you‚Äôre left with chapped lips and a super dry face. The answer to this dilemma is simple, a humidifier. A humidifier, especially if in your bedroom, will put the moisture back into the air and back into your skin, boosting radiance and slowing down signs of premature aging that occur more easily when your skin is dry. Keep up with SPF We know, it seems silly to slap on sun cream when you haven‚Äôt seen the sun in what feels like forever, but just because you can‚Äôt feel it, doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not there. Experts have even found that just by wearing sunscreen daily, can slow down signs of aging by 24%. Even wearing foundation with SPF won‚Äôt cut it; applying sun cream to your face and hands every morning is essential. And if you‚Äôre anxious about the chemicals in sunscreens with high SPF, dermatologists have said you can opt for children‚Äôs sunscreen as it‚Äôs just as effective and extra gentle on your skin. Don‚Äôt be afraid to supplement Taking supplements to give your skin a little extra lift, especially during the winter months, is a tip most of the A-list swear by. For winter, look out for vitamin E, C, and B2, which are full of antioxidants that will boost the production of skin cells and aid in the formation of collagen to keep your skin looking youthful and fresh. Another supplement that will work miracles for skin hydration and fine lines are hyaluronic acid capsules (see why hyaluronic acid is awesome here ). Exfoliate We all know that exfoliating is the key to soft skin, but getting around to doing it is another matter. We‚Äôre here to tell you, that you seriously NEED to, especially in the winter months. Between the cold, damp air outside and the dry indoor heating, your skin cells are majorly dehydrated, which can lead to a buildup of dead skin that can eventually clog your pores. Exfoliate your body once a week and your face once or twice a week, but make sure you don‚Äôt over exfoliate ‚Äì we suggest gentle scrubs, and keeping stronger AHA peels to a minimum. (Try our amazing DIY Breakfast scrub here ). Use lip balm, all over There‚Äôs nothing more irritating than cracked dry lips ‚Äì no one wants to be under the mistletoe with anything but the perfect pout. This means that a good lip balm is key to keeping your lips kissably soft (we love this Lanolips balm with super hydrating lanolin in), but you don‚Äôt need to limit your Vaseline or lip balm to your lips. Jennifer Aniston uses Vaseline under her eyes at night to keep away her crow‚Äôs feet, and you can also use it to tackle any dry skin on your face, like when you have a cold and your nose gets all cracked and sore. You can even use your lip balm on the ends of your hair or to tame fly always if you need a little extra moisture. Two Simple, Super Nourishing DIY‚Äôs To Combat Dry Winter Skin If you love DIY as much as we do, here are two super quick masks using one miracle ingredient to combat your dry winter skin; plus, you probably already have them in your kitchen. Honey: When your skin is starting to get a little dull, honey should be your go-to. Not only is it bursting with antioxidants that will replenish your skin, but it‚Äôs also antibacterial, so it‚Äôll get rid of any unwanted toxins from extreme heating. Simply apply a thin layer of raw honey directly onto your face and lips in circular motions, leave on your skin for 15 minutes and rinse off with warm water for radiant, gorgeous skin. Avocado: When celebs like Adriana Lima and Jessica Biel swear by this $2 ingredient, you know it has to be good. Avocado is rich in minerals, nutrients, and vitamins that promote healthy skin.

You know when you have a cut or a graze, a new piercing or a mouth ulcer, you‚Äôre always told to clean or gargle with salt water? Well, the practice isn‚Äôt just an old wives‚Äô tale, there‚Äôs magic in the water‚Ä¶ more specifically the sea water. If you‚Äôre a beach baby through and through, chances are your skin is pretty gorgeous, because bathing in the sea is amazing for your skin. Obviously, don‚Äôt forget the sun cream! Take this fact, for example, sea water and blood plasma have almost identical chemical compositions of mineral and trace elements. They‚Äôre the only two environments that are similar enough that if white blood cells were removed from your body and placed in sterile, diluted sea water, they could function as usual ‚Äì pretty incredible! Just some of the ahhhmazing benefits that sea salt can have on your skin include closing up open pores, soaking up excess oil, killing acne-causing bacteria, diminishing scars, healing wounds, and reducing inflammation. Here‚Äôs the magic‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs packed with skin-healing minerals: Rich in magnesium, calcium, and potassium, sea salt absorbs toxins in the body and on the skin to encourage the healing process. That‚Äôs why it can be a miracle cure for acne and infections. The sulfur in the water is a natural antiseptic drying agent, used in a ton of blemish treatments, while magnesium is anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial to add to the acne curing list. Yes, it can dry your skin‚Ä¶ in a good way: Salt naturally reduces moisture, and that means it can be amazing in regulating the overproduction of oil, which could otherwise lead to clogged pores. Salt water will not only balance sebum production but thanks to its exfoliating properties it can also help to clean your pores and effectively suck out extra moisture. But yes, you can have too much of a good thing, and we‚Äôve all noticed a slightly lackluster appearance to our skin after a day on the beach, so keep your swim shorter rather than longer. Sea salt is a natural exfoliant: The salt also has an exfoliating effect that helps to slough away dead-skin cells and promote healthy skin production. The minerals in the sea water open pores to clean extra deep, and also encourage blood-flow so that your skin is better able to absorb moisturizer and serums. Make an exfoliating scrub for your hands and body with 1 cup of coarse sea salt, half a cup of coconut oil, and five drops of your fav essential oil, like grapefruit, chamomile, or lemon. Mix the ingredients, and stir until they‚Äôre well combined (it helps if you use soft coconut oil), then store in a jar and use once or twice a week. You don‚Äôt need to go to the beach! You can use sea salt and purified water to mix up your own sea spa at home. Just combine two tablespoons of sea salt (it must be sea salt!) and 500ml of water (you can just boil tap water or use mineral water) in a bottle and shake, keep it stored in the bottle and use as needed. You can use this daily as a toner with a cotton pad to wipe over your face, and it will do wonders for oil and acne. If your skin tends to be dry, use this less often and depending on how it effects your skin you can increase or decrease use. When you go to the beach, swim in the water but be sure to rinse properly with a foaming cleanser when you‚Äôre home. You can also chill out and beautify at the same time by taking a bath with Dead Sea salt, which is so rich in magnesium it helps to improve the skin barrier function, reduce inflammation of the skin, and hydrate. acne treatment DIY exfoliating scrub ingredient spotlight sea water Tue, 25 Jul 2017 3 Comments Related Posts These 5 Things Will Make Your Skin Look‚Ä¶ Sat, 28 Oct 2017 5 Reasons Why You Need Jojoba Oil in Your Life!

I‚Äôm soooo thrilled to introduce you to the new Huda Beauty Rose Gold Palette ! This palette is something really close to my heart. I literally dreamt about these colors and I can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs finally here! I spent so much time making sure the colors were PERFECT‚Ä¶something not only I would use as a beauty connoisseur but ones that I really hope you would absolutely fall in love with too. It comes with 18 colors, including mattes, pearlized shades, and the most exciting part, 6 pure pigmentations. These are gorgeous, textured shadows with INSANE pigmentation. They will give your eyes this beautiful, 3D pop that I‚Äôm obsessed with! I find that the best way to apply these new shadows is by using your finger‚Ä¶and guys, the payoff is unreal . I really wanted to make this palette truly something that has everything you need ‚Äî from the blackest of black (that can be used as a liner too!), to earthy browns, and my current obsession, rose gold. I created this video to introduce you to the palette more closely and show you a few different looks you can achieve with it. I hope you enjoy, and again, thank you so much for all the love and support! It means the world to me!!!! The #HudaBeautyRoseGoldPalette will be available soon at shophudabeauty.com .

I admit it! I am totally guilty of not getting my share of rest! In fact, I‚Äôm lucky if I get a good 6 hours on some nights. So just what are the affects of not catching enough shut eye?

Everyone from Harvey Nichols, to Sephora, and Bloomingdales (to name a few) have decided to carry the power brand. Not only are they super natural and gentle on your skin, but they smell amazing and have incredible moisturizing power. These are some HIGHLY recommended products.

Having used the Entertainer before, I know these books have the ability to save you incredible amounts of money. However, I never thought about purchasing the body book. If you are a spa-lover or salon-whore, then you MUST buy this book. Not only is it almost double the size as it was in previous years, meaning almost EVERY spa/salon in the UAE (predominantly Dubai) is in this book, but the prices is very reasonable this year.

It is estimated that over 100,000 people are dead and many are injured without means for survival. A broken bone in Haiti, can unfortunately mean death by infection. Without the proper medical attention more Haitians will surely die and more children will be left without parents to care for them.

Eyebrows are one of your defining facial features, and perfectly balanced brows can make a massive difference to your look. Trying to make our brows look like sisters is difficult enough most of the time, but using an eyebrow ruler ‚Äì yep, it‚Äôs a real thing ‚Äì is the answer to turning them into identical twins, I swear! It‚Äôs super simple, and it makes the whole process of doing your brows so easy, plus you can get one on Amazon for less than $3! How to use a brow ruler: So, to start with you need to identify the center of your face and align the ruler so that it sits just above your brows. To make it easier, you can tape it in place so that it doesn‚Äôt move (I don‚Äôt know why they don‚Äôt come with an elasticated strap around your head)! You‚Äôll probably now realize that your brows don‚Äôt even start in the same place ‚Äì this is totally normal, almost nobody‚Äôs brows meet the middle in the same place, and one will usually be closer in than the other. The first thing you want to do is fill one of them in so that they start in the same place ‚Äì once you do that it will create so much harmony, you won‚Äôt believe. A little tip: if you have a slightly wider nose, you can bring your brows in slightly closer together, and it will make your nose appear slimmer (check out more nose slimming tips here ). Once you‚Äôve got your brows matching on the inner corner, use the ruler to make sure they‚Äôre also finishing in the same place. So, if your left brow ends at number 8 on the ruler and the other finishes at number 9, then draw a little extra on the left brow to make sure it also finishes at 9. You can also pinpoint where your brows arch and correct them with a brow pencil so that they both arch in the same place, but even just making sure they‚Äôre the same length will conquer so much! The brow stencil also works amazingly to help you pluck and shape your brows, check out my grooming routine using my Tweezerman X Huda Beauty Collection and a brow ruler: brow symmetry eyebrow ruler Golden ratio Wed, 22 Nov 2017 3 Comments Related Posts 5 Mistakes You‚Äôre Making When You Pluck Your Brows Thu, 7 Dec 2017 Will The New Makeup Forever Brow Collection Give You‚Ä¶ Mon, 12 Jun 2017 How to Get Bushy, Thick Brows!

Of course, we were all madly jealous that she had the gorgeous Aladdin picking her up on his magic carpet ‚Äì no need for Tinder when you‚Äôre a princess in Agrabah! So aside from the obvious dating-goals, here‚Äôs why Jasmine is still, and always will be our girl crush‚Ä¶ 1. She knew what she wanted, and she wasn‚Äôt going to settle for anything else! 2. Her hair was always flawless AF. Like volume level 100, and not a flyaway in sight. We‚Äôre inclined to believe her years as a princess gave her plenty of time to perfect her haircare regime, not the fact that she was a cartoon. So, if you want hair like Jasmine, here‚Äôre three things to try with your hair: 1) Blow-dry your hair upside down and tie it immediately up on top of your head, twisting it into a bun. Leave for 30 minutes while you do your makeup (or overnight) ‚Äì when you release your hair, volume shall be yours! Spritz with hairspray at the roots for extra hold. 2) Use the right products! If you want volume, you have to give your hair a little help; we swear by this Dallas Thickening Spray from R+Co , it‚Äôll do things to your hair that you thought only a cartoon could achieve! 3) DIY: Jasmine wasn‚Äôt even allowed out of the palace, and we don‚Äôt think she had access to our fav Ouai haircare products, but somehow her hair was ALWAYS super shiny. This hack with avocados will give you locks like Jasmine for a couple of dollars. 3. She had a pet tiger as her BFF! Rajah was the ultimate sidekick; he was loyal, fierce, understanding, and even better, he got rid of any unwelcome suitors ‚Äì we could all do with someone like that. 4. Jasmine‚Äôs lashes were on a whole other level of fluttery! If there‚Äôs one thing we continually strive for, it‚Äôs long lashes! This insanely good drugstore mascara is our new go-to for Jasmine-like lashes. Otherwise, there‚Äôs nothing like a pair of false lashes for ultimate princess allure. Check out our tips on how to apply false lashes here . 5. She‚Äôs not afraid to take risks and be adventurous! Jasmine was all about going out of her comfort zone and trying new and daring things ‚Äì you go, girl! girl crush hair goals princess jasmine Tue, 17 Oct 2017 4 Comments Related Posts The Product You NEED for Gorgeous Beach Waves Mon, 3 Oct 2016 My New Secret Weapon: Dallas Thickening Spray Sun, 22 Jan 2017 Why You Need To Throw Away Your Cotton Pillowcase‚Ä¶ Sat, 2 Dec 2017 Layla Yessss.

The only real dilemma is that buying all these products can cost a BOMB! But as it turns out, there are so many free, easy, and natural ways to boost your skin that your Mom has probably been telling you to do for years. So, if it seems like you spend your entire salary at Sephora ‚Äì don‚Äôt worry guys, we know the feeling ‚Äì try these alternatives first! Get some sleep As we said, you really need to listen to your Mom‚Äôs advice and catch some zzz‚Äôs! Remember it‚Äôs called beauty sleep for a reason. It sounds so simple and so straightforward, but the truth is too many of us have such hectic lives it means that we don‚Äôt get the seven hours not just our soul, but our skin needs too. Sleep gives your skin time to internally rehydrate so that it can recover enough moisture before it exits your body ‚Äì gross we know! When you‚Äôre tired your eyes look puffy, and this is due to the poor water balance, as your body just hasn‚Äôt had the time to retain the moisture it needs. Plus, the more sleep you get, the lower the level of cortisol you have in your body, which is the stress hormone that causes the skin to flare and age prematurely. Time to hit the pillow we think ‚Äì you never know, Prince Charming may wake you up! Tip : If you‚Äôre willing to invest, try a silk pillowslip, as it‚Äôs softer on your skin, reduces premature aging, and keeps your hair frizz free and smooth. Also, don‚Äôt forget to wash your pillowslips once a week to keep your skin clean and clear. Take a dip There‚Äôs no secret that the key to killer skin is staying hydrated and drinking a TON of water . But if you already drink the eight glasses the Doctor ordered, and wash your face religiously, then there‚Äôs still one more thing to try. The answer is seawater. Seawater can work wonders for your skin, as it naturally absorbs toxins in your body while declogging your pores, exfoliating, and promoting healing with its rich mineral content. So either do a little DIY with two tablespoons of salt in 500ml of water and use it as a toner for your face or get down to the beach. Check out all the deets on why seawater is awesome for your skin here . Get some sunshine We‚Äôre constantly being told the damaging effects of sunlight especially if you live in Dubai! But, there are new studies that say we need 10 minutes of unprotected sun exposure a day ‚Äì CRAZY, we know ‚Äì to absorb vitamin D in its best form. Vitamin D can actually play a role in preventing premature aging and damage to the skin‚Äôs structure. The vital thing is to keep an eye on your watch. Once the ten minutes are up, slap on the sun cream because too much will do the irreversible harm to your skin that everybody warned you about. Improve your air quality We all know that the polluted world we live in can have a really negative impact on the health of our skin, especially if you‚Äôre living in a busy city. This means it‚Äôs crucial to try and reduce the amount of time you spend in contaminated airspace and spend some quality time with Mother Nature. Anywhere that plants surround you, the oxygen is going to be so much purer, allowing your skin time to breathe and replenish; whether you go for a hike or a picnic, the fresh air really is good for you ‚Äì and your mind! Destress and smile We know this sounds kind of silly, but smiling can actually improve the quality of your skin! Smiling helps stimulate the capillaries in the face, which improves circulation and brings oxygen to your skin. The more you smile, the more you‚Äôll naturally boost your serotonin levels ‚Äì the feel-good hormone, reducing stress and wrinkles. So whatever makes you smile or giggle, make time for that, because everyone GENUINELY looks more beautiful when they smile.

I‚Äôm so happy to introduce you guys to the latest editions to our Huda Beauty family, our teeny-tiny Obsessions Eyeshadow palettes ‚Äì they are super compact, but their size is deceiving! Each of our four Obsessions eyeshadow palettes contain nine full-sized shadows and a mirror, in one palette perfect for beauty lovers on-the-go. Each palette has nine essential, versatile colors that will create divine looks for daytime, evening, and everything in between. Whether you want to get the ultimate smokey eye, create a bold statement look, or something more sultry and subtle, we‚Äôve got you covered. They‚Äôre perfect for keeping in your makeup bag or purse so you can touch-up whenever you need to. Meet the Obsessions Eyeshadow Palettes: Huda Beauty Warm Brown Obsessions: Okay, I know I shouldn‚Äôt have a favorite child, but this palette is making it difficult! I really love warm brown shades so much, and this palette makes every combination of gorgeous, beautiful hazel looks possible. It‚Äôs packed with eight mattes and one shimmer in heated tones of browns, reds, oranges, and copper. Huda Beauty Electric Obsessions: I love playing with bold colors, and this palette is packed with nine popping shades so you can create dramatic looks with just one palette. With six bold mattes and three shimmers in bright blues, electric yellows, and neon pinks, it‚Äôs the perfect palette for creating show-stopping looks. But it‚Äôs not just for the daring makeup lover; you can go understated and use single shades for liner or blend pops of color on your lids. Huda Beauty Mauve Obsessions: Literally, we had to call these palettes obsessions, because I‚Äôm SO obsessed with these combinations. The Mauve palette has six pigmented mattes, and three striking shimmers in a rich collection of dusty rose shades and plummy hues, which create the perfect soft, natural look. Go bold or be subtle, you can achieve any look with this palette. Huda Beauty Smokey Obsessions: Of course, we had to create an essential palette for getting one of the most coveted looks in the beauty world, the smokey eye! We gave you an intense black, warm shades of dark brown, taupe, champagne, gold and silver so you would have every possible color needed to create all the variations of the smokey eye you could ever want. Of course, with four smooth mattes and five stunning shimmers, you can do a bomb neutral look with this palette too! We really wanted you to have fun with color, so you put everything you need to create amazing eye looks in one compact palette for just $27 ‚Äì it also means if you can‚Äôt decide on just one palette, you can get more! The collection will launch exclusively at CultBeauty.co.uk on November 1, and at Sephora.com, Harrods, Selfridges, and ShopHudaBeauty.com from November 2. Global prices are: $27USD / ¬£25.00 / ‚Ç¨29.95 / AED135.00 / $48.00AUD / INR 2,250.00.

Again great job with these palettes theyre perfect for travelling, the colours are awesome!! HB Team Hi my love, so glad you like the colors.

Sun, 18 Sep 2016 HB LOVE: Guess What Sephora‚Äôs Bestselling Palette Is? Sun, 28 May 2017 Quick Tutorials using the Rose Gold Palette! Mon, 13 Mar 2017 Rhomda Why. Does site say (excludes United State) for shipping? syeda fatima Mam hudaaaa kattan please let me know when will the palette be available again?‚Ä¶this is so depressing please give us one more chance to have it‚Ä¶please Nerida Johansson I‚Äôm from Australia too. Have tried to keep up with when this Palatte would b re released, but it was al over the place and I missed out‚Ä¶again. Not happy. Marilyn Beck What‚Äôs going on with the palette, Huda?? I tried for hours yesterday to get it. I was on the website waiting for it to release early. I got it in my cart then the site crashed. Only by looking up comments on Instagram on Google did I find out anything at all that you‚Äôd apparently messaged on snapchat (I don‚Äôt have any of those things like twitter, instagram or snapchat) but even then the communication was less than forthcoming! Today I tried again, constantly saying ‚Äúsite under maintenance‚Äù. Finally got on ‚Äì my palette no longer in my cart and a message saying they‚Äôre all sold out!!!! I know this happens a lot these days with products in high demand but I really don‚Äôt understand why, when it was obvious there was going to be a stampede. So why websites aren‚Äôt prepared and why there isn‚Äôt enough stock (if it is indeed sold out) I find hard to fathom. I‚Äôll be disappointed if I can‚Äôt get one as it looks gorgeous, but I‚Äôm a woman of ‚Äúmature‚Äù years so it won‚Äôt be the end of the world. Some of these young ones are devastated, though, and I feel sorry for them. I was involved when the whole Make Up Geek Manny palette thing happened, and that was also frustrating, but Marlena was in constant communication with people and ultimately made sure everyone who wanted a palette got one, which was very impressive and put her company in a very good light. I hope you may make some similar efforts ‚Äì I‚Äôm sure that would be much appreciated! Anam The thing that annoyed and disappointed me the most was the fact that Huda and her team did not consistently update us with the release. They only vaguely mentioned a few times when the site will be up and running again.. First she said a few hours, then it was the next day, then it was a few more hours, until it was 11 pm when she finally updated us and told us it was just going to go on sale when the website is up and running again. I WAS SHOCKED. I mean really? Huda should have realized by the many followers she has, by the long queues waiting for her lipstick release in Sephora and by the hype of the palette in social media that there were A LOT OF PEOPLE who are waiting for this release. She should have anticipated it. Well, so much for a fair chance for everyone. Really wasn‚Äôt worth staying up all night, much rather queue at Sephora. Aj I‚Äôm really upset and disappointed too because first we were not given a launch date for ages. Then you said mid September. This is not mid September. If the site crashed I am sorry however you didn‚Äôt deal with us that well. You didn‚Äôt give up clear updates. People stayed up all night and then you said you would give an update later on in the day. You didn‚Äôt. Now people are saying they got their palette however it was not announced to us that it was on the website. You said you took it all down :'( now it‚Äôs out of stock. Completely unfair. I‚Äôm very upset. Vanessa When will I be able to get this pallete . I live in the eastern coast? Nae This palette was hyped for MONTHS. By far the worst makeup release. The site crashes, back up again, then crashes again. Some people have been up for hours trying to snag it and others have been able to purchase it. For the palette to be $65 and shipping $20, you guys beed to get it together. The price is ridiculous and I was still willing to purchase. Valeria I was really sad that I was not able to buy the palette I was literally refreshing the website every 15 minutes all day at work. Even after your tweet saying that it would be fix in 15 minutes. Oh well I mean we are humans no ones perfect. Hopefully it‚Äôs available tomorrow. sad Aleana Phelps The site has been down all day! Yaya Its 8:30 in California time , is the website still not running? Cant wait place my order. athra kashat THE SITE IS DOWN AND YOU CANT ORDER ANYTHING Olga I cant come to the shop!!!! Online shop doesnt WORK!!!! Whyyyyy???? Jessica I have to be honest and say I‚Äôm very disappointed Huda. I think it‚Äôs very unfair that you post and advertise this all the time on social media but not all your subbies can buy it. Like people from Australia. I was looking forward to buying it and some lashes today and then I found out I won‚Äôt be able to get this palette Natalie Luke88 We cant get it in australia. Awwww its so beautiful. Luxx You‚Äôre website is down. Marilyn Beck As far as I could tell we could get it in Australia, although as the site crashed and mine is no longer in my cart I can‚Äôt confirm for sure. But I did create an account with my Aussie address earlier in the day and had added a lipstick to my cart with no problems, so I assumed it would be okay. If it‚Äôs indeed sold out, though, it‚Äôs a bit of a moot point‚Ä¶.. hopefully Cult Beauty may be a better bet, but I‚Äôm not holding my breath after yesterday‚Äôs fiasco! Jess You guys mentioned this palette will have a promo sale but with all the confusion of restocking no one has mentioned that. Just wondering if that is a possibility. Don‚Äôt know if i can afford $85 US for just one palette. Please let us know.

A couple of weeks ago our skincare expert Dr. Doris Day debunked a ton of myths behind pores , which quite frankly made us feel a lot better about ourselves. This week she told us a thing or two about blackheads, and now we‚Äôre feeling pretty zen about our blackhead situation. Here‚Äôs what she told us‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúMany people think the black dots on their nose are clogged pores or blackheads, but actually they‚Äôre not. Blackheads are formed from a physical obstruction of the opening of the pore. The black dots are actually mostly fine hairs, or sebaceous filaments, which are a combination of sebum and skin cells.‚Äù Which basically means that those tiny little black dots we‚Äôve been after for years aren‚Äôt even blackheads at all! The bad news is, ‚Äúunfortunately you can‚Äôt permanently eliminate these filaments and no amount of squeezing helps.‚Äù Ooops! But there is hope for us, ‚Äúyou can control them with a bit with glycolic and salicylic acid, and gentle exfoliation.‚Äù So, if you‚Äôve been ferociously trying to dig out your ‚Äòblackheads‚Äô with these acne tools , you might want to give your skin a break! Now that you know that most of your blackheads are in fact, probably not blackheads, you have a lot less to deal with. To help combat blackheads and those pesky little sebaceous filaments, try glycolic toning pads, like these Nip + Fab Glycolic Fix Exfoliating pads ($13 for 60 cleansing pads), which you can use every night on your skin ‚Äì just be sure to apply SPF during the day. You can also try this Salicyclic Acid 2% Solution from The Ordinary ($5.60), which will exfoliate the inside walls of your pores and improve skin clarity. Finally, to keep blackheads at bay, try to do our awesome DIY exfoliator once a week (we swear by it), and you‚Äôll soon notice an improvement in your blackheads. blackhead extraction blackheads Thu, 21 Dec 2017 6 Comments Related Posts How These Acne Tools Could Be Making Your Skin Worse Sun, 10 Dec 2017 Why You‚Äôre Getting Booty Spots And How To Get Rid Of Them Sat, 23 Dec 2017 IGNORE Everything You Ever Heard About Pores ‚Äì This‚Ä¶ Thu, 23 Nov 2017 Javairia Have you tried the Bobbypin method.

But honestly, an expensive trip to the dentist isn‚Äôt the only way to achieve perfectly white teeth. For years, I relied on a few simple DIYs and my favorite, inexpensive teeth whitening strips for a glowing smile, and they honestly work amazingly! Give some of these a try, and you‚Äôll be on your way to a brighter smile in no time: DIY: Strawberries and Baking Soda I swear by this! Mash up a strawberry and mix it with a teaspoon of baking soda. Once well combined, dip a soft toothbrush in it and gently brush your teeth with it. The combination of malic acid and vitamin C removes stains and brightens the teeth for a noticeable difference. Crest Whitening Strips I‚Äôve always been cautious with whitening strips as I‚Äôve tried some before and they‚Äôve made my teeth really sensitive, but Crest Whitening Strips have always been my go to for a pain-free option. My favorite, the Classic Vivid Teeth Whitening Kit, costs as little as $34, but they have a ton of other options you can try too. See how I use them in my video. DIY: Brushing with Activated Charcoal Powder This is such an easy thing that you can do every day to keep your teeth stain-free and sparkly. You just need to load up your toothbrush with toothpaste and dip it in activated charcoal powder . While you brush your teeth, the charcoal powder absorbs plaque and bacteria and lightly polishes teeth to remove stains. DIY: Oil Pulling This is basically swishing a tablespoon of coconut oil around your mouth for 15 to 20 minutes. It might sound a bit gross, but afterwards, your mouth will feel so clean and your teeth will look so shiny, it will be worth it. It‚Äôs an ancient technique which works to draw out bacteria from your teeth and gums (the fatty cell in bacteria is attracted to the fatty component of coconut oil), and it also completely neutralizes your breath, so it‚Äôs a good thing to do once a month. I hope these help some of you, and darlings, always remember to be mindful of potential risks when using any products in non-conventional ways. diy teeth whitening white teeth Wed, 24 May 2017 7 Comments Related Posts This Drugstore Product Will Give You A Hollywood‚Ä¶ Sun, 6 Aug 2017 The Coaly Grail: Could Activated Charcoal Be Our New‚Ä¶ Mon, 9 Jan 2017 One Thing You Never Thought Of Doing With Oil Tue, 27 Jun 2017 Farah Rizwan Hi huda can the strawberries and baking soda hack be used everyday please reply i really want to try this hack Huda Beauty Hi my love, I wouldn‚Äôt advise doing this every day.

Stirring the fire, Urban Decay‚Äôs latest addition, the Naked Heat palette joins it‚Äôs four gorgeous predecessors in a more fiery, colorful version than ever before. The neutral, nude shades of past palettes have been replaced with 12 sizzling amber shadows, following this year‚Äôs trend of toasty warm hues. What it is: The fifth in the Naked palette series, Heat has 12 stunning shades in both matte and shimmer finishes with burnt oranges, rich siennas, deep plums and bronze tones. The palette features a full-size mirror and a double-ended brush that with precision and blending brushes. What it does: 12 shades work seamlessly together to create a palette that will allow you to create a multitude of looks for both day and nighttime. Long-lasting pigments that blend like butter mean your look will be easy to build and hard to let go of. What we liked: Where do I begin? I LOVE that Urban Decay has finally done a warm-toned, brown palette, with a collection of cohesive shades that will look beautiful on all skin tones. The modern spin on the packaging is very 2017, and I think they really hit the nail on the head with it. The palette has everything: from light to dark shades that are perfect for smoky eyes and cut-creases, gorgeous shimmers and mattes, and pigments that are to die for. I didn‚Äôt notice much fallout, and even after I swatched the palette, the pans still looked brand new. My FAV matte shades would have to be Low Blow, HeDevil, Cayenne and En Fuego, and I loved the shimmer shades Lumbre and Scorch. And, although this is a warmed toned palette, the shades Ashes, Cayenne, and Low Blow are a little more neutral, so there is a transition if you‚Äôre not used to using warm colors. What we didn‚Äôt like: There was nothing I disliked! I really like that Urban Decay always includes a double-ended brush, which makes this a great starter palette, and good value. If I were to be picky, I would say that the blending brush could have longer bristles, which would make it softer, quicker and easier to blend out eyeshadows, but the dense flat brush worked perfectly for applying the shimmery shades. I would highly recommend this palette: the colors are stunning, and the versatility within the shades gives you so much to play with, which means you can create loads of really unique looks.

The idea comes from ancient Ayurvedic medicine and involves taking a spoon of oil and rinsing it around your mouth like a mouthwash, for twenty minutes. Believe it or not, this detoxifying method actually has a ton of health benefits that surpass oral health, and it can even improve acne, whiten your teeth, help with headaches, and detox your entire body. What You Do: On an empty stomach ‚Äì first thing in the morning is the best time ‚Äì swish between a teaspoon and a tablespoon of oil around your mouth for twenty minutes (at least ten minutes if you‚Äôre in a hurry). Our preference is coconut oil (because obvs we have a ton lying around), but you can also use sesame oil or sunflower oil. Initially, it might feel a little gross, but persist, and like us, you might even end up enjoying the experience! It should always be done on an empty stomach, so wait at least four hours after eating, and an hour after drinking. Whatever you do don‚Äôt swallow the oil, after swirling, spit it out in your bin. You can do almost anything, except speak, while you do this but keep an eye on time, as if you do it much longer than 20 minutes, it‚Äôs possible that the toxins could be reabsorbed into your body. Follow by rinsing your mouth with warm water, or salt water (if you can be bothered!), and brush your teeth. How Oil Pulling Works: It‚Äôs quite gross to think about, but your mouth is filled with bacteria, fungi, toxins, and plaque. Oil pulling literally cleanses your mouth by drawing out all the toxins from your gums and teeth, before they‚Äôre able to spread to the rest of your body. Why Oil Pulling is Awesome: Who‚Äôd have thought that you can forego a ton of expensive beauty products simply by following this daily ritual? Oil pulling is an amazing way to improve your health and detox your body, skin, and gums. Though there‚Äôs yet to be significant research into oil pulling, promising results have been found and many doctors recommend it ‚Äì apparently, Gwyneth Paltrow and Shailene Woodley are fans. Here‚Äôre just some of the amazing benefits: Clears skin: Catching out nasty toxins before they reach the rest of your body has a huge impact on your skin. The same way washing your skin gets rid of surface bacteria, oil pulling gets rid of bacteria that causes skin problems before they have a chance to take hold. Reports have shown that oil pulling for a month has helped improve acne and eczema. Teeth whitening and fresh breath : Oil pulling can remove surface stains from your teeth, and because the fats in oil can dissolve plaque, it prevents plaque build-up and reduces the risk of tooth cavities for an extra white smile. The removal of bacteria from your mouth also results in fresher breath throughout the day. Detoxes your body: The mouth is our gateway to the majority of substances in our body, by removing bacteria from the mouth before it has a chance to reach the rest of your body majorly impacts on your health. Increases energy: Our immune system works 24/7 to eliminate toxic waste from the body. By getting rid of these nasty toxins at the source before your body has to, saves precious energy to be spent on other activities. Reduces headaches and hangovers: We‚Äôll be honest, anything that promises to cure a hangover is worth trying; the process of oil pulling will remove alcohol toxins still lurking in your body from the night before, in turn helping you and your body feel much better. Headaches and migraines can be a reaction to your body being under toxic stress; extract the toxins, reduce the stress! Why Coconut Oil is Our FAV: We‚Äôve found that coconut oil, (try to use raw organic coconut oil) is the best oil to use. Not only is it easy to find and inexpensive, but it‚Äôs also by far the best tasting of the bunch. Coconut oil also contains lauric acid that has antimicrobial and anti-fungal properties, while Vitamin E is rich in antioxidants and it‚Äôs antibacterial. If you‚Äôre going to have oil in your mouth for twenty minutes, it should at least taste okay! Oil pulling can easily become part of your morning routine: swish while you shower and tone, or while you get dressed and scroll your Insta feed. If you‚Äôre at home all day, take advantage of the period after lunch before dinner and swish on an empty stomach while you watch TV. acne oil pulling oil pulling benefits teeth whitening Tue, 27 Jun 2017 14 Comments Related Posts The Broke Girl‚Äôs Guide to Teeth Whitening‚Ä¶ Wed, 24 May 2017 5 Reasons You Have Bad Breath And How To Get Fresh Thu, 11 Jan 2018 There‚Äôs A Skincare Super Ingredient Hiding In‚Ä¶ Sun, 23 Apr 2017 Nimra Hi huda I am from Pakistan and non of your original makeup is available here all if them are the 2nd copies.

We have, and we love it! Fashion icons, Kim K, Ciara, and Rihanna have all been spotted wearing adventurous highlights in their manes and have caught our attention! Are these trendsetting divas on to something, or is this just a fad? Either way, we love it and we‚Äôre following this trend!! Great tip: Highlights are great for people who want to take focus away from traits like a slightly larger nose, etc. They are a great tool for taking attention and softening the overall appearance of the face! ‚Äì H.Kattan in beauty Thank you fans!! by hudabeauty Fri, 7 May 2010 11 Comments I just wanted to say thank you so much to everyone who has been supporting the blog!

So, when my sister showed me this crazy looking mascara I was totally down to see if this would be the next best beauty tool, although I‚Äôll be honest, I wasn‚Äôt sure it would be! My first impression of Avon‚Äôs Mega Effects Mascara was that this strange wand was a huge gimmick, but of course, I‚Äôll try anything in the name of beauty! What it is: A new ‚ÄòWonderbrush‚Äô designed to bend and adjust to multiple angles to amplify every single eyelash from root to tip. The formula promises to be sweat-proof and non-flaking, clump-proof, and provide 24-hour volume! What it does: The unique mascara wand is designed to deliver 40% more mascara ‚Äòthan the average brush‚Äô to give you extra volume, while the wetter formula means clumps are far less likely to form. Avon says that by using the brush at different angles you can get different effects: 0¬∞ (vertical) gives quick application and volume, 40¬∞ can be used for upper and lower lashes, and 90¬∞ gives you full application from root to tip. A post shared by Huda Kattan (@hudabeauty) on Oct 1, 2017 at 7:10am PDT What we liked: The first thing I noticed was that it really gripped into my lashes and deposited a lot of product, which gave me a lot of volume ‚Äì so far, so good! I don‚Äôt have the longest lashes, and they‚Äôre quite sparse, so I was impressed that it did lengthen them and add volume. It also lasted really well throughout the day, and I didn‚Äôt notice any flakes or get panda eyes ‚Äì a huge plus, as I‚Äôm prone to smudging unless I bake really well. What we didn‚Äôt like: Opening the mascara was like a battle, I know it sounds ridiculous, but it was really hard to get the mascara out (on their website they have instructions for opening it!). Once I finally got it open, I liked how it made my lashes look, but it‚Äôs not as easy to use as the standard mascara wand, and I felt like I didn‚Äôt have as much control. I also found it difficult to use with my false lashes, so I wouldn‚Äôt try this if you have falsies on. The verdict: If you have lots of volume and thick lashes but need length, this might not be the ideal mascara for you because it won‚Äôt add lots of length, just more volume. If you have long lashes and just need volume, you‚Äôll love this. Overall, it‚Äôs an interesting concept, although a little more challenging to use, but if you‚Äôre a mascara connoisseur and want to try it because it‚Äôs cool, then give it a go. For the average girl, I think there are other drugstore mascaras that will do the job better. I suppose the fact that no other brand has tried to copy the design (it‚Äôs been around for five years) could be a hint at its effectiveness.

The dupe? L.A. Girl‚Äôs Beauty Brick Eyeshadow Nudes and we‚Äôre obsessed for so many reasons. If beauty on a budget is your thing, you need to add this kit to your collection, ASAP! The palette is almost identical to the Naked3 palette (although we wish it had more than three matte shades), practically color for color, with neutral shades to glittery, soft rose gold shimmers and deep brown mattes; so you can achieve both smoky and minimalist looks. The case also includes a mirror (perfect because we‚Äôre always on-the-go) and a dual-ended blending brush, which is ideal for contouring the shape of your eye, mastering lines along your lids and smoking out the crease. Of course, no look would be complete without multiple coats of our fav drugstore mascara to thicken our lashes and our ultimate party lashes . This offer is so good it‚Äôs the ideal gift for every member of your squad, and you‚Äôll score extra bestie points when you give them the gift of glam that‚Äôs sure to light up their lids. You got this, go out and slay the festive season in style! For $7 we can‚Äôt quite expect it to live up to the standards of our fav Urban Decay Naked3 Palette, but considering it got a 4.3-star out of a 5-star review rating on Amazon, it‚Äôs a pretty impressive dupe. drugstore dupe eyeshadow dupe urban decay naked palette Wed, 20 Dec 2017 10 Comments Related Posts Is The Urban Decay Naked Heat Palette As Hot As It Looks?

A video posted by Huda Kattan (@hudabeauty) on May 4, 2016 at 8:09am PDT 2) Step out of your comfort zone and try a new shade. The fun in makeup is experimenting, so use the day as an excuse to try a new color you‚Äôve never tried before. 3) Buy a lipstick for your best friend (or mother or sibling). You may already know the power of a lippie, so pay it forward! Buy your favorite lipstick for a friend or family member. 4) Share your favorite lipstick memory. Trendsetter reminds me of when I first met my husband. That‚Äôs the color I was wearing back then, and it was the shade I had in mind when I re-created it for our Lip Contour! 5) What‚Äôs your favorite lipstick trick or tip? Share it on Twitter or IG and tag me @hudabeauty ! 6) Create a new color! Discover a whole new color by mixing two of your favorite lipstick shades to create a brand new color. 7) Try a new technique. Ever try contouring your lips using a lighter and darker shade? Dabbled in ombre lips? #NationalLipstickDay is the perfect excuse to try. Remember to tag #NationalLipstickDay and @hudabeauty in your posts so I can see how you‚Äôre celebrating. Can‚Äôt wait to see your looks! in celebrity , DIY - NATURAL The Grapefruit Diet, The Fastest Way to Weight Loss? by hudabeauty Sun, 21 Oct 2012 21 Comments VITAMIN HB | CELEBRITY DIET By Huda Heidi Kattan I think we‚Äôve all dieted at one point in our lives, if not before summer, then before prom or our wedding‚Äìthere‚Äôs always been that one little battle to lose a few extra pounds!

I have a great secret for you! I started using this when I first started university and it is my fool-proof chest lift! I swear by it! Pec Fly Exercise: taken from fitnessvancouver.ca: ‚ÄúThe Pec Fly is an exercise for the chest. This exercise is meant to isolate the pecs more with less help from the triceps as in a chest press or push up. Make sure to keep your arms almost straight with just a slight bend at the elbow. Bending the elbows more will only make the exercise easier and less effective.‚Äù Starting position : While on your back, lie with your arms out to your sides and your elbows bent slightly.

But they‚Äôre only cost-effective if you know how to take care of them properly ‚Äì I‚Äôve seen some majorly destroyed lashes from a botched cleaning job before. So, it‚Äôs no surprise they can get completely wrecked when cleaned too vigorously, which for me, would be pretty soul destroying after one wear! If like me you‚Äôre a regular lash wearer, the habit can not only be slightly addictive (seriously) but pretty expensive too. Whether you prefer to spend a little more on quality lashes that can be cleaned or re-worn up to 20 times, or skimp and get a pair that you can dispose of after a couple of uses, the longevity of their flutter is all down to the proper lash cleaning method. The main thing to remember is your lashes are super delicate; whenever you‚Äôre handling them, always hold them firmly at the base of the lashes so that the lashes aren‚Äôt pulled from the band. Here‚Äôs my tried and tested, failsafe way of cleaning false lashes to prolong their lifespan: A post shared by Huda Kattan (@hudabeauty) on Jul 5, 2017 at 11:07pm PDT 1. Gently peel away old glue holding the lashes firmly by the base. 2. Place the lash between two cotton pads soaked in oil-free makeup remover. 3. Lightly press the cotton pad and wait 30 seconds, so the lashes are saturated. 4. Carefully wipe away any remaining mascara with an oil-soaked cotton bud. 5. Using a clean cotton bud, wipe away any excess mascara residue. 6. Place the lashes back in your lash box, securing the lash band firmly, to keep the lash curled. Storing them back in the original package is the best way to keep your falsies clean and safe. If you attach them firmly to the band and press them down this will help curl them.

My lashes are already really curly, but even then, they look better when I curl those suckers up! I‚Äôve heard time and time again that using lash curlers is the worst thing you can do for your lashes. I completely disagree! While I will say, you must be extreeeemely gentle when using a lash curler, it really makes a world of a difference! A friend of mine actually suggested to use the lash curler after you apply mascara. She said wait 5-10 minutes, then apply mascara. WOW!!!! This really helps keep your lashes perky and will hold all day, no matter how heavy your lashes may be! It adds that vavavoom to your look!! image credits glitznow beauty cosmetics curl curler effect Eyelash eyelashes false Flagellation how huda hudabeauty kattan Languages mascara Maybelline Programming to use Wed, 20 Oct 2010 5 Comments Related Posts Extra Long Lashes With Cotton And Mascara?!

Thanks Taylor for the suggestion! Taylor Sephora‚Äôs heated curler is the best eyelash curler, imo. It‚Äôs a ‚Äúone-sided‚Äù curler, so you don‚Äôt ‚Äúcrimp‚Äù your lashes‚Äìso no possible damaging it. Plus, it‚Äôs heated. And it‚Äôs the size of a pen and uses one AAA battery, so it‚Äôs portable. I love that thing. I can‚Äôt go back to anything else. rema Really? Yah i heard the heated ones are the best! Do you remember how much it is? Taylor I think I paid $12 for it.

Of course I am the biggest fan of false lashes, but since she doesn‚Äôt like to wear them every day, I gave her a really simple tip that is fool proof! When you apply mascara, try to apply multiple coats! The best way to get feather lashes is to use a lash comb and brush your lashes in between coats. So if you apply three coats, brush the lashes after ever coat and voila, super feather yet subtly dramatic lashes!!

When I was 18 years old, I‚Äôd always bought lashes and didn‚Äôt know how to use them, even if a make-up artist applied to me make-up for a wedding, 1 hour later I take them off because I don‚Äôt like the look. but what I noticed about you lashes that they are unique and your eyes mashalla gorgeous and the lashes compliment them. since I discovered your blog I always want my eyes to look like you.

Ever since I was fourteen, I‚Äôve been obsessed with trying new mascaras and, well let‚Äôs be completely honest, most of them are not as awesome as they claim to be! And we all know that the ads are full of fake lashes that are undoubtedly some of the most extreme costume-drag-queen-lashes ever invented! So of course the only way to know if a mascara works is to try it and if you‚Äôre like me then you try it a million times and under maaaaaaaany circumstances before you decide whether or not it hits your trash or stash. Ok, here‚Äôs the deal with the YSL Shocking Mascara : personally, I know YSL has had some pretty kick ass mascaras in the past, and some that I have loved very much! The YSL Shocking applies mascara exactly like the name says, shockingly dramatic! It‚Äôs one of those mascaras that when you apply it, it quickly builds and creates super bold lashes. This mascara is perfect and ideal for gals with super long lashes that want a little drama and super thickness! I don‚Äôt however, recommend this for girls with shorter lashes, unless you wear false lashes (which I love the way it builds on false lashes), since it could create lashes that are too thick for the length. I really love this mascara, especially when I pair it with a primer or lengthening mascara, but of course I just stick to false lashes! üôÇ In the photo I am wearing Shade #1 with only the mascara (no primer or additional mascaras). I also used this on top of my false lashes and it gave them much more drama! I tried this in shades 1 and 2 and I love 1! It‚Äôs not too dark, so it does look slightly more natural, but still gorgeous! beauty Makeup mascara product Tue, 6 Dec 2011 7 Comments Related Posts This Drugstore Mascara Just Became My Go-To Mon, 4 Sep 2017 Extra Long Lashes With Cotton And Mascara?!

Thank u Thank u Huda!!!! lots of love oox Amna LOVE this mascara, ppl think i‚Äôm wearing fake lashes.

But there‚Äôs one thing most of us have had the frustration of discovering, and that‚Äôs that not all lashes are going to suit you. While lashes might make you feel better, they don‚Äôt necessarily make your eyes look better if the fit and style are wrong. In fact, that‚Äôs what got us into making false lashes, as there just seemed like such a lack of variety on the market and we wanted everyone to be able to find the perfect pair to frame their eyes properly. So, because it‚Äôs super confusing to find the best style, here‚Äôs our guide to finding the right pair of falsies to flatter your eye shape, whether that‚Äôs round, hooded, deep-set, almond or monolid. Round Eyes If you have large round eyes, you‚Äôre able to see white around your iris. Wispy lashes with more drama towards the outside wing will create a seductive cat-eye shape and look for curled options to keep the eye from looking flat. We recommend: Huda Beauty Scarlett lashes . Almond Eyes For almond-shaped eyes like RiRi, you won‚Äôt be able to see any white above or below your iris (unlike round eyes). You can get away with almost any lash you like, and you can show off the sexy shape of your eyes with voluminous lashes that are evenly distributed all the way along the band. We recommend: Huda Beauty Sasha lashes . Hooded Eyes The term hooded describes how the fold of the eyelid hides some of your lid when your eyes are open, so that not all of the lid is visible. To open up your eyes as much as possible, avoid super dramatic lashes, which tend to make your eyes look smaller. Instead, choose a pair which is slightly longer in the center; this will create an illusion of depth. We recommend: Huda Beauty Claudia lashes . Deep-Set Eyes If your eyes sit slightly further back under your brow bone, you‚Äôre lucky because you can add all the drama with your lashes. A long, curled pair of lashes will open up your eyes and enhance their size. We recommend: Huda Beauty Lana lashes . Mono-Lidded Eyes Monolid means no crease on your eyelid can be seen ‚Äì most common among Asian ethnicities. You can opt for a fluttery lash with crisscross layers that open up the eye. Our top tip is to always curl them once they‚Äôre applied, to give more height to your eyes. We recommend: Huda Beauty Carmen lashes . Finally, once you‚Äôve found the right lashes to suit your eye, you need to make sure that you trim them to fit your eye properly. The length of the false lash band is always long to accommodate everyone, but most of us need to trim off some excess for a comfortable fit.

Mon, 20 Nov 2017 How To Wear Your False Lashes Up To 20 Times Thu, 6 Jul 2017 Lilly rose I have down turned eyes and I struggle with eye makeup because of this . Could you please recomend lashes or any tips for down turned eyes ! Please and thankyou xoxo .x.hum.x. A great way to lift down turned eyes is by using winged eyeliner. Try and keep the inner eye of the eyeliner thin and when doing the flick do it upwards towards the end of your eyebrow as it will make your eye look more lifted and is super cute. Whereas if you were to do the flick straight instead of upwards it wouldn‚Äôt have the same affect and would look less appealing as it wouldn‚Äôt compliment your eye shape. Also try cat eye eyeshadow and also cat-eye lashes to compliment your eyes and give them a more lifted look.

Yes, it would be seriously lit if we ran a marathon, traveled to a new continent or lost 50 pounds, but let‚Äôs be real, most of the time they‚Äôre SO unachievable. We‚Äôve compiled a list of five realistic beauty resolutions that‚Äôll leave you looking and feeling like a bawse! So, when December 2018 comes around and people are asking how you‚Äôre looking so hella fresh, you‚Äôll be able to thank your Huda Beauty New Year‚Äôs resolutions put together by yours truly. Have a DIY day It‚Äôs no secret that here at HB HQ we live for all natural DIYs that are super quick and easy. So, schedule a weekly DIY day so you can make sure both your hair and skin are getting the attention and vitamins they need. We love DIYing on a Sunday to detox after a hectic weekend, and to start the week fresh. Drink more water We know it can seem like a chore, but honestly, if you want flawless skin and lustrous locks, you need to find a way to drink at least 2 liters of water a day. We‚Äôre not saying that water will magically give you skin like Naomi Campbell, but if you don‚Äôt drink enough water already and you start to drink more, you‚Äôll see a huge difference in your body, skin, and hair. It will also have a huge impact on your general health, plus it‚Äôs super helpful for weight loss. If you don‚Äôt believe us, see what happened when we doubled our H20 intake for a week . Start the year with the right skincare We all know the three steps to gorgeous skin ‚Äì cleanse, tone, and moisturize. But every regime becomes ineffective if it‚Äôs not catered towards your skin‚Äôs specific needs. So make sure you know your skin type and then follow these tips to get the right cleanser, toner, and moisturizer to help your skin come through all year long. Be good to your hair No one‚Äôs ever had hair like a Victoria Secret Model without a serious amount of TLC. So start the year with a fresh cut, and then book yourself into the salon for regular trims. Make sure all your household hair tools and products are going to help you maintain sleek hair, so stay clear of products containing harsh chemicals and grab a brush that won‚Äôt tug your locks, like a Tangle Teezer. We swear by using a silk pillowcase , as it helps to tame flyaways and boost general hair health. Check out our hair guides: 5 Things You Should Never Do If You Want Hair Like Rapunzel and 5 Things You Should Never Do To Your Fro . Wash your makeup brushes weekly Not washing your makeup brushes regularly is a big no-no! Instead of giving you a perfect finish, they can leave you with major breakouts. If not washed regularly, your brushes will collect bacteria, which you‚Äôll then reapply to your clean skin, potentially leading to blocked pores and pimples. Aim to wash your tools once a week ( here‚Äôs how ); you can always multitask and do it while you‚Äôre DIYing a face mask. If you‚Äôre a makeup sponge girl, you should wash it after every use, and leave it to air dry ( check out our tips here ). These are so easy to stick to!

The name refers to bringing out the natural ‚Äòdrape‚Äô (or natural U-shape) of your cheeks. The effect is more chiseled and structured-looking cheekbones using a pop color that is extremely well-blended. Products like Marc Jacobs Air Blush Soft Glow Duo uses two complementary cheek colors to achieve the draping effect.

There are tons of things that can cause hair loss ( check them out here ) and a list of things you shouldn‚Äôt do to your hair ( see how to get hair like Rapunzel here ), but there could still be an enemy at work that you hadn‚Äôt even considered. I know it sounds like we‚Äôre being dramatic ‚Äì we are ‚Äì but for a very good reason‚Ä¶ the water could be working against you, and we take this very seriously! You‚Äôve probably heard the term hard water and soft water being thrown around and presumed it had nothing to do with you, but actually, it does! If you live in an area with hard water, it might taste great and be good for your body, but the rich mineral content that characterizes hard water can wreak havoc on your hair and scalp. In comparison, soft water has very few minerals and is treated so that it tastes a little salty, but it‚Äôs far better for everything; from your hair and body to your kettle! So, if you live in an area that has hard water (to be technical, an area that‚Äôs rich in limestone), like Dubai and most of the US, it could be having a significant impact on the health of your hair. Hard water contains minerals and oxidizers that could be causing split ends, breakage, dandruff, and don‚Äôt even get us started on how it could be affecting your skin too! It also stops your shampoo from lathering up as efficiently, as the magnesium and calcium react with surfactants, making them less effective. Not only is your shampoo less efficient, but the minerals in the hard water create a scaly, almost sticky feeling on your hair, and leave a film that prevents moisture entering the hair follicles so that your hair looks dull and feels dry. Hard water can even affect how long your fresh new highlights stay in your hair, as the mineral deposits can mess with the dye. The good news is, now that you know this could be the issue, you can battle it effectively (just google your region, and you‚Äôll be able to see if you live in a hard water or soft water area). You can buy a shower filter that you fit onto the head of your shower, which will filter the water, giving you more pure water immediately. Miranda Kerr is obsessed with Alkaline shower filters, but there are a ton of different shower filter options that remove the bad stuff and are super easy to find online. If you‚Äôre not able to invest in a shower filter, we have a DIY to help you ‚Äì don‚Äôt we always?! Rinse with apple cider vinegar! Not only does this remove the scaly build up on your hair, but it makes it super soft, shiny and it‚Äôs great for your scalp too. Fill a glass with one-quarter ACV and the rest with bottled water, once you‚Äôve washed your conditioner out, use this rinse as the last thing before you get out of the shower.

Been using it since two years. I Keep spreading the word so that my fellow females who suffer from same issues and those who can‚Äôt afford expensive things needed for it can just use this and solve their problems. I still have dandruff due to the weather (Riyadh KSA) + hard water. That‚Äôs for sure the reason &amp; after using ACV I‚Äôve seen the difference in my volume coz I had freaking thick hair and long till my buttocks but thank god my hair length didn‚Äôt get affected but my volume reduced. Also split ends in every single hair strand!!!! Literally every single hair. Any diy for it apart from acv???? Love your products HUDA. Wish I had all of them but unfortunately I don‚Äôt.

The result is usually a panda look that you definitely didn‚Äôt plan for and a whole lot of patching up! So, when your eyeshadow is dropping off the brush like Salt Bae and his seasoning, here are the best techniques to prevent and correct those pesky eyeshadow marks. Tip 1 ‚Äì Eyes First: Tip one is also basically step one, and it makes the whole frustration of eyeshadow fallout a lot more bearable: Start with your eye makeup first! This means any fallout won‚Äôt ruin your foundation as you can easily wipe it away before. If you‚Äôre a die-hard foundation first kinda gal like me, don‚Äôt worry we‚Äôve got you covered too‚Ä¶ Tip 2 ‚Äì Tap Out: My favorite thing to do is super simple, and it‚Äôs just to make sure you tap out your brush before you apply the makeup to your eyelid ‚Äì you probably do it with face powder, but so many people forget about this with eyeshadow. I know Lisa Eldridge always taps out her brush on a towel, Charlotte Tilbury would always brush it on a tissue, while Kim Kardashian‚Äôs makeup artist Mario Dedivanovic would tap out his brush onto his hand. All of these methods work well, and as many brushes do pick up extra product, it really does help to pat your brush onto something to remove any pesky falling product. Tip 3 ‚Äì Block it: Probably the technique I use the most often, is to grab a tissue and hold this underneath my eye while I apply eyeshadow. Super easy, super cheap, and it works! Tip 4 ‚Äì Bake: This isn‚Äôt my favorite technique, but you can apply a ton of baking powder under your eye while you do your eyeshadow, then when finished, you simply brush away all the excess powders. But depending on the colors you use, this isn‚Äôt guaranteed to be the neatest fallout removal as sometimes it can streak. Tip 5 ‚Äì Get it Wet: Another thing you can do, although I would only recommend this with specific eyeshadows (because you could end up ruining your eyeshadow!) is to dampen the brush with setting spray or water before you pick up product. Some shadows, like some of the NARS and Anastasia Beverly Hills eyeshadows, can be used with a wet brush, which intensifies the pigment and limits fallout. BONUS TIP! Stay flawless all day‚Ä¶ If you‚Äôre one of those people that always ends up with smudged mascara under your eye or creases from your concealer, then baking is your solution. Though I‚Äôm not a fan of baking for preventing fallout, I do think it‚Äôs the perfect thing to do after your eye makeup to lock all your hard work in place. The technique, which involves piling on translucent powder under your eyes with a beauty blender and letting it sit for ten minutes, leaves your eyes under eye area staying matte, crease-free and panda-less all day long.

I loved meeting every single one of you at my recent Masterclass in Abu Dhabi! I was blown away by how kind and sweet you all were. Thank you so much for coming and for making my final Masterclass a huge success! Also, those of you who weren‚Äôt able to join us and signed up to watch the class online ‚Äì thank you so much for your support. I hope you guys enjoyed the class! As promised, here‚Äôs the list of products I used on my gorgeous model Shae (as well as some tips to make application a little easier). Skin prep Start with a heavy moisturiser to ensure the skin is hydrated throughout the day. I like the Guerlain Orchidee Impreial le Concentre .For combination skin try use an oil based primer, and for acne prone skin use a more silicone based primer. Brows &amp; Eyes I love to begin with brows first as it creates symmetry in the face and will help later on when you start with the eye makeup application. Begin by brushing your brows up to your desired shape. I used the ka-BROW! from Benefit in shade 3 &amp; 4 to define the lines and shape. Then I used the Smashbox Brow Tech pencil in dark brown. For Shae‚Äôs eyes, I used the Huda Beauty Rose Gold Palette . If you want to use a primer, I recommend the Too Faced Shadow Insurance . Set the primer with a translucent powder ‚Äì this will also help with blending. As a liner I used the Inglot Gel liner AMC (Advanced Makeup Components) in shade 77 (black) mixed with a bit of Inglot Duraline . Foundation &amp; Contouring I used the Make Up For Ever HD Foundation Sticks in shades 053/170. If you struggle to match your exact skin tone, it‚Äôs easier to opt for a slightly lighter one and then make it darker with bronzer or blush. For the foundation I used a stiff bristled brush. The RMS round foundation brush is a good option. Next I used the Cle De Peau concealer in shades Ivory &amp; Ochre. For contouring Shae‚Äôs face I used the Make Up For Ever HD Foundation Stick in shade 177, followed by a powder contour using the Anastasia Beverly Hills palette. For the perfect nose contour, choose an ashy brown color. I like to use the Zoeva Concealer Spectrum palette, followed by the Victoria Beckham X Estee Lauder bronzer . Baking, Highlighting &amp; Blush I used the Ben Nye powder in shades Fair and Banana as well as the Givenchy Poudre Premiere with my Beauty Blender . Afterwards I applied the Make Up For Ever Pro Finish Multi Usage Powder in shade 153. For highlighting I used shades Angelic and Moondust from the Huda Beauty Rose Gold Palette ; and for blush I used the Zoeva Coral Spectrum Blush palette. Lashes &amp; Lips I curled Shae‚Äôs lashes before applying mascara using the Kevyn Aucoin Eyelash Curler . Next I used the Make Up For Ever Aqua Smoky Lash Waterproof mascara prior to applying the Huda Beauty Lashes in style Farah . A general rule is to apply as much glue as the thickness of the band. I added a bit of foundation from the Cinema Secret Concealer palette #2 to balance out Shae‚Äôs lip shade. Then I used the Huda Beauty Lip Contour to line and fill the lips using shades Trendsetter to line &amp; Bombshell to fill in the lips. I then added the Huda Beauty Liquid Matte in shade Bombshell to the center of the lip to hydrate her lips, followed by the shades Angelic and Moondust from the Huda Beauty Rose Gold Palette added to the on her cupid‚Äôs bow to highlight. To finish off the look and ensure that Shae‚Äôs makeup stays in place, I used the Urban Decay All Nighter makeup setting spray. So these are all the products I used during my Masterclass. If you guys have any more questions, please leave them in the comments. Hopefully this guide helped you a little bit to recreate this look yourself.

Obviously, practice makes perfect, but the right brushes will take you a long way to getting a flawless finish. I‚Äôve been a fan of Real Techniques ever since I tried their Miracle Complexion sponge , and I was super excited to see how this new brush collection would perform, especially as it‚Äôs specifically designed to work with powders. They look sophisticated, luxurious, and plush, and OMG, they are SO soft! The Real Techniques PowderBleu Collection is designed to emulate real blue squirrel hairs, and I have to say I‚Äôm impressed. When it comes to using powder products, natural makeup brushes always come out on top, as their unique texture works faultlessly for picking up powders and then beautifully distributing them. So, it goes without saying that this new faux hair design is pretty revolutionary. What it is: The first ever collection of synthetic brushes designed exclusively for use with powders. The brushes mimic rare blue squirrel hairs, which are renowned for their super fine, soft hairs, which are usually sought after by luxury brush brands. The collection includes five brushes and one powder puff (below, left to right): B01 Soft Powder Brush for all over powder application, B02 Soft Finishing Brush for small and hard-to-reach areas, B03 Soft Complexion Brush for powder foundation or bronzer, B04 Soft Shadow Brush for eyes, B05 Soft Kabuki Brush for the face and body. What it does: The unique design of the bristles make them ideal for picking up powders and putting them down without disturbing any makeup underneath. They‚Äôre ideal for layering powders and blending for a completely seamless finish. What I liked: The first thing I consider with a product is the way it looks, and I really loved this collection for its aesthetic design. The brushes are displayed in really chic, round containers and the handle of the brushes are really long and diamond shaped ‚Äì at first, I thought this was a bit weird, but it actually works really well for hold and usability. The bristles of the brushes are ahhhhmazing ‚Äì they‚Äôre super soft and feel SO natural, and I think it‚Äôs great to find brands that don‚Äôt use real squirrel hair, especially when it‚Äôs clear that there are so many great synthetic alternatives. The collection has a really good range. The B01 Brush gives a gorgeous subtle finish, so if you like more natural-looking makeup, this will sweep on a light layer to set your makeup. I personally like something with a little more push, and the shorter denser bristles (almost kabuki style) of the B03 brush worked incredibly for me; this was my fav brush, and it really gave me the most amazing application and coverage ‚Äì it‚Äôs perfect for bronzer and powder. The B02 brush is great for highlighting and applying powders around the chin, eyes, and nose, and I love the Bo4 eyeshadow brush ‚Äì it worked really well, especially for getting into the socket of your eye and blending, or simply just sweeping color over your lid. Finally, the B05 Kabuki brush works really well for the d√©collet√© and buffing bronzer or highlighter onto your body. Even though the bristles are shorter, you get so much movement that it feels like natural hair, so it‚Äôs not hard to blend out. What I didn‚Äôt like: I‚Äôm really impressed with these brushes. If I had to say one thing, it would be that because the bristles are very soft, if you‚Äôre using the brushes with longer hairs, they pack on less product. That said, I can‚Äôt fault the way they picked and put down product. I personally wouldn‚Äôt reach for the powder puff, as this isn‚Äôt a necessary makeup tool for me. The verdict: I feel like you don‚Äôt need the entire collection: The B03 is a must-have brush, I‚Äôm obsessed with it, and the B02 is also a necessity. These are without a doubt the best brushes I‚Äôve ever used from a drugstore brand, and I also love that you get so much more than just a brush: the beauty blogging background of Real Techniques‚Äô mammas are Pixiwoo, so with each brush you get all their blogging experience and they create a video tutorial for each brush. Price: B03, B02, B01, $20.

You may already know how obsessed I am with beauty DIYs, so I thought I‚Äôd round up some of my favorite (and inexpensive!) beauty remedies that is as close as your kitchen cabinet. Some of these things work even better than the most expensive products, so I picked out some of my trusted ingredients, like coconut oil, apple cider vinegar, aspirin, and potatoes to do a video on how you can use each of these to be even more gorgeous. I really hope you guys enjoy watching this video and please leave me comments on any beauty DIYs that you guys LOVE! Maybe I can do another video and include some :). Thank you so much for watching! Xx RECAP: ASPIRIN ‚Äì Smash an aspirin (preferably one with vitamin C‚Ä¶if not, just add a little lemon juice). Add to a glass with a little water and dab on any acne spots. It has salicylic acid that helps dry out acne. COCONUT OIL ‚Äì Take a tablespoon of coconut oil, warm until it‚Äôs liquifies and coat hair overnight. Wash out in the morning to add hydration to hair. LEMON ‚Äì Slice a lemon in half, top with brown sugar and use to exfoliate dark areas like your elbow and knees. Helps to exfoliate naturally. You can use on your face to minimize pores. GARLIC ‚Äì An amazing anti-fungal for nails! Also keeps it clear, white, and beautiful. It also helps to strengthen nail. Just slice half a clove of garlic and place in a bottle of clear nail polish. Apply to nails often to help strengthen them. POTATOES ‚Äì Slice in half and rub where you need to lighten, like underarms, knees, elbows, and even under eyes (you can slice thinner slices for the eyes). APPLE CIDER VINEGAR ‚Äì I put a couple drops in a bottle of water and rinse after shampoo and conditioner for INSANE shine. Also amazing to get rid of any lingering residue from products. The only thing is if you had your hair recently coloured, keep in mind it can lighten in. For skin, it‚Äôs amazing at managing the pH levels of skin. Combine equal parts water and ACV, and dip in a cotton pad to rub on skin. HONEY ‚Äì A super humectant! Whenever my lips are feeling chapped or red, I apply a little honey to soothe and calm my skin. TURMERIC ‚Äì A great anti-inflammatory for skin! A great facial mask I like to use is combine coconut oil, honey, and pinch of turmeric until pastey and apply on skin. Leave it on for a few minutes, and rinse off with warm water. in Nail , Tutorial Eyeshadow on Your Nails? It Works! by hudabeauty Wed, 21 Sep 2016 1 Comment Hey my loves!

Just take the peel of a ripe banana (not overripe, you want one that‚Äôs yellow with a few dark spots), and rub it on your blemish for ten minutes or so. You‚Äôll see a big difference in your acne, especially after a few days. Why does this work? A lot of reasons! Bananas have so many anti-inflammatories, like vitamin A, zinc, and manganese. The peels are also natural exfoliants to remove toxins and helps to prevent bacterial infections that may contribute to acne. The enzymes help to heal scars and prevent new pimples from popping up, and the starch unclogs your pore. It‚Äôs basically an anti-acne powerhouse!

So you know how much I love contouring, but some people actually prefer the opposite, aka ‚Äúnontouring.‚Äù Like the name suggests, it‚Äôs a more highlighter-focused look with little to none contour.

OK So true story! I looooove contouring noses! I actually think it‚Äôs my fav part to contour because I love seeing how it literally manipulates the symmetry of a face with just a few techniques. I swear I could spend an entire day contouring different noses and I‚Äôd be the happiest person!! I have a long list of ‚Äúhow-to‚Äôs‚Äù when it comes to contouring your nose mainly because it all depends on the person, the shape of their face, the symmetry between their facial features (yes, it gets very technical!) however I‚Äôve decided to narrow it down and give you my Top 3! 1. Try to layer your contour, starting wit a cream contour then followed by a powder contour. The cream consistency will really help define the area and lines to create the perfect symmetry, and the powder contour will help blend everything a little better while adding subtle shadows. If you want a more softer look, then only opt for the powder contour. 2. Start your contour from the beginning of your brow bone and work your way downwards. Again, this will help to create a better balance in your face and will ensure that both sides are equal. Even though you are perhaps only focusing on a very small area of your nose, in order to camouflage it properly ‚Äì extend your contour from your brow bone until the bottom of your nose. 3. Blend, blend, blend! There is nothing worse than looking perfect from the front, however have very noticeable contour lines from the side! My ultimate tip for this is to blend inwards, towards the centre of the nose. This will give you a slimmer and more pinched nose. Blending outwards will make your nose appear wider. So keep blending inwards, and once fully blended ‚Äì apply a little concealer along the centre of your nose to finish the look off. I hope these quick tips helped you guys!

El producto en crema te ayuda a crear una simmetria perfecta, el polvo envez te ayuda a esfumar bien el contouring. Empieza el contouring cerca de las cejas y baja de all√¨, as√¨ que las dos partes son iguales. y por ultimo asegurate de esfumar re bien el contouring, porqu√® de vez en cuando se ve de lado y el resultado es feo. Esfumalo hacia el interno de la nariz as√¨ que se vea m√†s fina, si esfuma al externo la nariz se ver√† m√†s ancha. Espero que entendiste bien. Kathleen Walker Hey there!

But the reality is that nobody really has time to do everything they‚Äôre meant to do every day, and it‚Äôs our beauty routines that often take the hit. And, the expectations we have as far as our appearance goes are extremely high, thanks to Instagram, which we love, but which we also feel pressure from. Luckily, there a lot of things we can do to make beauty quicker and easier. I‚Äôm a firm believer in multi-tasking ‚Äì I‚Äôm a mum running a company, so I know the demand on time ‚Äì and I wanted to create some different tips and techniques on how to get extra beautiful with minimal effort. The idea of super soft skin usually conjures images of intense scrubbing and a daily moisturizing routine, but there‚Äôs no reason anyone can‚Äôt do this soft skin hack and save a ton of time in the process. So, if you‚Äôre after insanely soft skin in just minutes, the answer is‚Ä¶ Using a thick body oil while you bathe! Let me explain: A hot shower or a soak in the bath makes your skin extremely porous, and when you apply oil to wet skin, it‚Äôs able to seep deep down into your skin and lock in all the moisture of the water as well. You‚Äôll find that you need far less body oil than if your skin were dry, and you get a much more effective and speedy application, which won‚Äôt leave you with annoyingly greasy skin. Here‚Äôs how it works: It‚Äôs super speedy, and you can use any thick oil you prefer, like coconut oil, olive oil, Johnson‚Äôs baby oil, or whatever else you have. Once you‚Äôve showered and washed, rub the oil into your wet skin ‚Äì you can either get out or submerge yourself back in the shower briefly. Then gently pat yourself dry and admire THE most hassle-free, softest skin ever. If you love to wind down in the bath and you‚Äôre extra lazy, you can simply add a few tablespoons of oil to your bath after you‚Äôve washed, and soak for five minutes. My absolute FAV oil to use for this is the Shiffa Luxury Gold Body Oil , which is really thick but not greasy (plus, I know it won‚Äôt break me out!). This is actually the best way to use oil on your skin as it penetrates deeper into your skin, absorbs much faster, and doesn‚Äôt leave a greasy layer on your skin. Effectively, it‚Äôs also sucking in the moisture of the water. Try this every other day, and you‚Äôll never look back! body oil diy skin hack soft skin Wed, 31 May 2017 14 Comments Related Posts The Ultimate Beauty Oil?!

People actually thought I was much older ‚Äôcause I was always wearing full foundation, concealer, mascara, strong eyeliner, and a bold lip. You guys know I‚Äôm all about symmetry, whether it‚Äôs using a capiler to make sure my brows are sisters , or tape to get the prefect contour ‚Äì I feel the exact same way about lips! It just makes the face look so much more harmonious, and I truly believe that lining your lips should be part of your daily beauty routine. That was the main reason why I decided to create our Lip Contours ‚Äì I wanted to take the whole idea of contouring from the face to the lips. It wasn‚Äôt a gimmick for me. Although no one is born with perfect face symmetry, it‚Äôs really fun to be able to play around with that using makeup! To get the perfect lips, here‚Äôs a quick How-To for you to follow: 1. Look at your lip shape and assess the areas you want to contour (add more volume, fix the symmetry, improve the shape etc) 2. I like to apply a little foundation on my lips after moisturising them ‚Äì I just feel like the color is way more intense that way! 3. Take your fav Lip Contour , draw an ‚ÄúX‚Äù on your cupid‚Äôs bow to create the arch, then line the bottom centre of your lips to match the same as the top. 4. Connect it at the corners (the goal is to make your lips appear even). 5. Generally speaking, you can overline a little bit, however just don‚Äôt do too much to avoid a clown-like lip. 6. Once you‚Äôve created the desired shape, you can use a lighter shade to fill in the rest of the lip. This will help create the illusion of a more voluminous pout. Afterwards I like to use my finger to lightly blend the colors together (to get rid of any harsh lines). lip contouring lip tutorial Tue, 7 Feb 2017 Leave a comment Related Posts My Top 3 Tips for the Perfect Nose Contour!

So I recently did a video on Foundation Basics and decided to do a quick post which might help you guys find the right foundation shade! I know it‚Äôs such a tricky thing to do and it‚Äôs definitely not something you can do within 5 minutes. It takes patience and loads of swatches! But trust me, all that time you‚Äôve invested is going to be SO worth it when your foundation shade matches your skin tone and your selfies look flawless! It‚Äôs very important to figure out what your undertone is in order to know which shade foundation to go for. First off, pull up your sleeve and look at the veins below your wrists. Your veins (in most cases) will either have a green or blue tone to it. This helps to decide whether you should opt for a foundation which is more golden/yellow, or more beige. My veins are green so I always opt for golden, yellowish toned foundations. My skin color is medium olive so I always feel that golden-yellow tones match my skin best (quick note: these foundations tend to look kinda yellow in the packaging, don‚Äôt get put off!). If you have blue veins, then you‚Äôre more than likely have a beige undertone and should opt for a cool toned foundation (more white than yellow). Now; if you have both ‚Äì blue &amp; green, then you‚Äôre somewhere in between and should look for a more neutral foundation shade. I always recommend to people not to purchase the foundation right away (unless you‚Äôre 100% sure). Rather swatch it, wear if for the day and if you can ‚Äì apply a bit on the one half of your face and check it out in natural light. This is the best way to see if the color matches your skin tone, if it‚Äôs suitable for your skin type and you can also see the coverage &amp; wearability of the product. Hope this quick tip makes foundation shopping easier for you guys!

TheSilentOne Hi I have a question If we brought a foundation and it isn‚Äôt the right shade we would have to keep buying more of different shades until we find the right one. This would be a waste as other shades of foundation would sit lying around and never be used again. I was wondering why don‚Äôt you give out a small sample pack with the light tone, medium tones and dark tones sets for people to try out and see which works for them.

They‚Äôre just plain awesome, and since I have gotten requests for more pics of me, this part of my blog will be something similar to these concepts. Enjoy! I happen to be a semi-private person. My wedding, for example, only had 35 guests (including my family), but it was pretty fancy and intimate, which is completely much my style. I guess this makes perfect sense of why I usually celebrate my birthday with one of two friends and family. This year, I did the same thing and went to dinner with my hubby and sisters and just a couple of friends! It was small, but sweet‚Äìjust my style! My look for my birthday was actually done really quickly! I dyed my hair earlier that day (I always dye my hair at home) for an all over color that is just a tad darker and dramatic than my usual do. Since I ended up styling my hair myself, I ran out of time so had to rush my makeup! Whenever I don‚Äôt have too much time to spend on makeup, despite focusing on my eyes, I concentrate on getting a perfectly sculpted face! I pretty much threw an eyeshadow on, and some heavy liner with two sets of lashes! I love the fact that the i‚Äôs are dotted with hearts &lt;3 I played Papparazzi and took some photos of myself! Yum!! Kitsch Cupcakes!! I die!! All done and ready to go home!

We‚Äôve had hundreds of requests for a shade comparison guide with your favorite brands, so we‚Äôve put together an easy shade reference guide to help. I know a lot of you will only be able to shop our foundation online, so we hope this comparison table will guide you to find your perfect shade. You can also check out our 5 tips for figuring out your undertone and finding your ultimate foundation match here . We‚Äôve chosen six brands that everyone was asking us to give their matches for, so if you know your shade in that brand you can see which one should match our foundation. Because foundations are so unique, we weren‚Äôt able to find a match for every shade from each brand, so below are what we deem to be close matches or shades that are almost the same ‚Äì if there‚Äôs no direct match we‚Äôve included the difference between the similar foundation shades in brackets. If your shade isn‚Äôt in the guide, have a look for the ones which are close to it, and using our undertones guide to help you , you‚Äôll be able to weigh up the right flavor for you. Please remember these are the shades we found to be close, but they may appear different when applied to your skin, so we always recommend that you try the product in store. Our final tip, if you‚Äôre debating between two shades online, if you opt for the fairer version of the two, it can always be warmed up with bronzer. You can also check out findation.com , which allows you to enter any shade of foundation to find your match. This is just a guide to the shades we deemed to be a good match for our #FauxFilter foundations. If you find your shade based on the recommendation of this guide doesn‚Äôt match for you, Huda Beauty cannot be held responsible for your purchase. #hudabeautyfauxfilter which shade are you?!

I‚Äôve been a fan for ages and i love your products! Here in Dubai sephora does not have a return policy for gently used products unfortunately.

Can‚Äôt wait to receive my foundations . I have a question for you please, being a makeup artist we have to mix and match some foundations to get a perfect match, as we can‚Äôt carry every shade in our kits. I bought 4 didfferent shades from your foundations and I have some NARS, makeup forever, Est√©e Lauder and Clinique foundations in my kit which I mix them no problems. My question is, can I mix the huda beauty foundations with other foundations (mentioned above) to get a desired shade, or you don‚Äôt recommend that. I know some foundations don‚Äôt work well when mixed with others and some do, so was just wondering. Thank you. Kirstie Hi. Armani luminous silk 3.5 and 4 what would the shades be in this please.

April The guide is exactly what I was hoping for, you are exceptionally intuitive to your customer needs. However I was hoping when I reviewed the matching that Makeup Forever would make the list for comparison. I‚Äôm a 370 R. I have red/cool undertones. Can you help direct me to a possible match? Aqsa Hu Just tried your foundation on and fell in love! I‚Äôve never had a foundation match so perfectly! Honestly, I‚Äôm always in between shades. I‚Äôve worked for many different makeup brands so I‚Äôve had the chance to try on many foundations but they‚Äôve always been too white or too yellow or too orange. And when they did match my cheeks they would make my chin gray and I always needed to color correct. When I tried on the faux filter I did half my face with color correcting and the other half without it and honestly I love it without the correcting more! I‚Äôm so excited about this I can‚Äôt wait for different formulations in this shade range. May Allah bless you with more success Maz Can I kindly ask what shade you used? Also for reference, what shade are you in mac?

I was wondering what would your recommendations be for the shades closest to the Maybelline Matte Poreless Foundation 220 and 310? Thanks so much! From little ol‚Äô New Zealand xo Jackie Hey HB team! I was wondering what would your recommendations be for the shades closest to the Maybelline Matte Poreless Foundation 220 and 310? Thanks so much! From New Zealand xo Monty Hey Ladies (and Huda if you see this, hey girl!), So, I bought the #FF foundation online this morning at 6:30am when it came out on Cult Beauty in the UK. I decided what colour to buy online by looking at foundations that I know for sure are my colour online ie Fenty Beauty &amp; Estee Lauder double wear, and I compared the photographed swatches on their websites with the photographed swatches on the websites selling #FF. I thought ‚Äòyayy‚Äô I found my perfect match which was Cinamon, however by chance I went to Selfridges this evening and it was wayyyyy too light for me and looking at the comparsions for the richer shades on this gudie after swatching all evening I think they don‚Äôt do the shades justice and would really recommend (especially where the foundation is filling gaps in the market ie extreme light and richer shades) to go in to a store to see what works for you. I was a little disappointed and sad about how red and gold the richer tones are as I (and a lot of people I know of my complexion) are neutral shades and I had high hopes that #FF would recognise that as it was bringing out an inclusive range. I ended up buying Mocha which is not my fenty shade using this guide, as chocalte moose was way too golden üôÅ Really apperciate all your efforts Huda Beauty team, and hope what you have cooking up in the kitchen are gap fillers for the neutral shades that are missing in the richer section! As always, I will be ready, willing and open to testing it out üôÇ annalisa battista hi guys! This chart is a GREAT idea!

And it‚Äôs not just the design I‚Äôm obsessed with; their formulas are nearly always on-point too ‚Äì they‚Äôre like the girl next door of beauty brands, cute but accessible. Benefit‚Äôs Boi-ing concealer has fast become a cult product and a consistent bestseller for the brand, so when they decided to give it a makeover, I was keen to see how they would reinvent it ‚Äì I‚Äôm obsessing over their new metallic packaging look. Not only did Benefit repackage the original Boi-ing, but they also gave it some sisters too; three other siblings that promise to target and conceal in different ways. Would the Boi-ing Industrial Strength Concealer stand up to its famous past? What it is: A full-coverage creamy matte concealer designed to stay all day. It comes in three shades: 01 ‚Äì light, 02 ‚Äì light-medium, 03 ‚Äì medium. What it does: The heavy-duty formula is designed to cover dark-circles, blemishes, and discoloration. It can be used with a concealer brush to accurately give full-coverage to blemishes, or you can dab it under your eyes with your fingertip to hide dark-circles. What we liked: I love the new packaging, and I found the texture light but highly-pigmented, and when I applied it with a small dense brush it gradually buffed out with some stippling (I used the Kat Von D concealer brush). I chose shade 02 ‚Äì light medium, but the shade was very peachy, whereas I‚Äôm more yellow toned, so this wasn‚Äôt ideal for use on all areas of my face. What we didn‚Äôt like: I was never a regular user of Boi-ing before, but I did like the formula. I feel like this formula is much oilier than before, and it has quite a greasy texture (there was actually a thin layer of oil on top of the product when I bought it). Although I found it worked well on my skin before I applied foundation, when I tried to use it after my foundation it didn‚Äôt seep into the makeup, it just sat on top of my skin. It‚Äôs also designed to be ‚Äòindustrial strength, ‚Äô but by the time I had blended it to look natural, it wasn‚Äôt full-coverage. I also think the collection lacks diversity: there are so many different skin tones, and varying undertones within every skin tone, so offering just three shades is really not enough. This might work well for you if you only need light coverage of minor dark circles, but for me, it‚Äôs not a product I would reach for again. I also think in today‚Äôs world, there needs to be a better shade offering (the darker end of the shade spectrum is hugely lacking), particularly as this is a product that has been reworked. It‚Äôs a massively popular formula, so I recommend you try it in store first.

For starters, Gossip Girl basically made blogging a thing, while simultaneously teaching us how to curb the haters. Literally, no matter how much shade S &amp; B got thrown their way, they always managed to come through ‚Äì normally with a brand-new outfit and a blow-dry to match. But it wasn‚Äôt just the wardrobe and the endless hairstyles that kept us watching ‚Äì although they did help! Behind all the schemes and scandals, each character was a BAWSE in their own right. So here‚Äôre just some of the many important things we learned from Gossip Girl‚Ä¶ 1) Don‚Äôt listen to the haters, they only criticize out of jealousy and insecurity ‚Äì even Serena did it sometimes. 2) We all know retail therapy is actually a thing, and in the words of Blair herself: ‚ÄúWhoever said money doesn‚Äôt buy you happiness, didn‚Äôt know where to shop.‚Äù Seriously, surveys have shown that 52% of Americans do it to boost their mood! 3) Don‚Äôt let social media run your life, but don‚Äôt get caught looking anything less than fabulous on your profile. As Eleanor Waldorf once said ‚ÄòFashion knows not of comfort. All that matters is the face you show to the world.‚Äô For our tops tips on how to take a snap as hot as a Manhattan socialite on page 6, check out our post on how to slay a selfie here . 4) BFFL means FOR LIFE. For guidance, just look at Chuck and Nate‚Äôs ultimate bromance: no matter what happened in the end, they always had each other‚Äôs back ‚Äì even if you do fall in love with your best friend‚Äôs ex! 5) Jenny Humphreys drew our attention to the fact there IS such a thing as too much black eyeliner ‚Äì all we‚Äôre saying is she got exiled from Manhattan for a reason. While a smoky eye is a classic, there needs to be a gradient of pigmentation, otherwise you‚Äôll probably end up looking like a raccoon, not Kate Moss. If you need a little extra guidance, check out these seriously sleek eyeliner looks . 6) Gossip Girl helped us save face on SO many occasions! Remember, if you get caught in between salon appointments, a braid or a high pony will literally save you. If you need some up-do inspiration, these IG looks gave us major vibes . 7) When it comes to love, don‚Äôt always go for the obvious option. Even if it seems impossible at the time, if you love someone, you can make it work. 8) Trademark your look ‚Äì whether that‚Äôs a bowtie like Chuck, a headband like Blair or lashes like Huda. 9) Being extra AF is nothing you should be ashamed of, and never let anyone tell you otherwise. blair and Serena Gossip Girl life lessons Tue, 14 Nov 2017 5 Comments Related Posts 5 Reasons We Wanted To Be Just Like Jasmine, And Still Do Tue, 17 Oct 2017 9 Reasons Why Love Actually Is The Best Christmas Movie Ever Tue, 19 Dec 2017 4 Easy Hairstyles To Hide Your Greasy AF Hair Wed, 17 Jan 2018 Marcela This is soooo true!

Whatever he touches, he turns into a piece of art, which is why his latest collection of Eye Amplifiers are no different. After trying out his recent Loubichrome Polishes , I was extremely honoured to be one of the first in the world to receive this collection and try it for a few days before it was officially revealed to the public. The reason for a collection based only on Eye Amplifiers is to enhance the feature Loubouin considers most expressive . Eyes engage, reveal, and expose as Christian explains in his own words: ‚ÄúYou can see happiness, sadness, fear, fierceness‚Ä¶You definitely see everything through the eyes.‚Äù This collection is inspired by one of Christian‚Äôs beauty icons, Egyptian Queen Nefertiti, as well as his travels to India which are tributed to the collection‚Äôs rich colors and intense pigments. More about the collection: The Mascara is extremely opulent and reminiscent of Art Deco architecture. It‚Äôs something which you‚Äôd find in your jewelry cabinet, rather than makeup bag. My favorite feature of the Mascara is definitely the wand ‚Äì which is uniquely comprised of both vertical and horizontal bristles, assisting in smooth application and creating a dramatic, voluminous finish. The Ink Liners are stunning! The formula is amazing and the design of the bottle itself is SO Louboutin. I love how involved he is and that he personally designs everything. From Fashion to Beauty ‚Äì there is a consistency in his style and you can recognize his work miles away. One of the liner shades are Rouge Louboutin, which is the same iconic red shade present in his other designs. It is Christian‚Äôs interpretation of ‚Äúl‚Äôoeil de braise‚Äù: the burning look of desire. OK so True Story! The Brow Definers may be my new best friend! I must say, the application with both the Brow Definers and the Kohl Liners was super smooth and they feel very luxurious. The pigments are very rich and it almost feels velvet-like on the skin. The formula literally glides on and the packaging is insanely beautiful. I love the gold cap and embossed signature, as well as the fact that a sharpener is included in both the Brow Definers and Kohl Liners. Christian‚Äôs latest collection is a piece of art, and any Beauty Connoiseur‚Äôs dream. It almost makes me want to buy a second set to keep, admire and never touch! Louboutin is a true artist, and I think he is one of few who managed to successfully merge Fashion and Beauty in such a remarkable way. The official launch date is the 23rd of March, which includes a series of eye amplifying tools.

At HB HQ the general consensus is the bigger the flick, the better! Although we love the classic liner look, sometimes there are new trends that are just too gorgeous to resist ‚Äì not to mention we‚Äôre fans of switching up our makeup game whenever an opportunity arises. Fortunately, this fall the runways were literally dripping with stunning liner looks that will take your makeup game to a whole new level. For the days when getting out your eyeshadow seems way too much drama to handle, these stunning new liner trends will give your look a major refresh instead. Don‚Äôt be scared to get creative! DOLL-LIKE EYES We‚Äôre literally dying over how cute this playful, accentuated-glitter-lashes look is ‚Äì such a pretty look for fall. Even better, it‚Äôs super easy to do: just grab a fine eyeliner and accentuate your natural bottom lashes with small flicks. If you feel like adding a little sparkle, separate the bold black lines with glitter. DITCH THE FLICK Forget about perfect precision, ditch the flick and go for this rounded look instead! This thick-edged eyeliner is the answer we‚Äôve been waiting for to hide our clumsy cat liner flicks! Seen on the runways at Jason Wu and Tom Ford, this liner is like a super edgy, grungy smoky-eye, and we love it. FLOATING CUT CREASE We‚Äôve been dying over the floating cut crease on IG for a while now, but we‚Äôre loving the colorful, bold update showcased on the Prabal Gurung runway. Stray away from your lash line with a floating cut crease; it can be natural and sexy with a simple high-cat liner, or playful with different colored liners and bright hues. FIERCE FELINE LINER Easy, sassy, and the definition of fierce, this liner came to slay on the fall runway. Seen on the catwalks at Miu Miu and on a ton of It-girls, this liner is the easiest way to update your look for fall partying. To recreate the look, take a liquid liner and start at the middle of your eyelid and draw a line all the way from the center of your lid to your brow bone (towards the end of the brow), and fill in. BIG BOLD KOHL It‚Äôs time to leave the liquid eyeliner inside your make up bag and grab your khol ‚Äì the bigger the pencil, the better! We‚Äôve had it drummed into us for a long time that lining your eyes all the way around will make them look smaller, but Alexander Wang showed us we were SO wrong. This look is definitely cool, and we think the smudgier the better! If you have big eyes, don‚Äôt forget to trace the inside of the waterline, as well as all around the lash edges; if you‚Äôre cautious, play with dark brown liner on your lower lash line. cat liner eyeliner trends fall eyeliner trends Mon, 23 Oct 2017 4 Comments Related Posts How To: My Signature Eyeliner Look Mon, 13 Nov 2017 If This Doesn‚Äôt Change Your Life, It Will‚Ä¶ Wed, 28 Jun 2017 Why Glitter Is Our Go-To For Everything This Season Mon, 11 Dec 2017 Jeffree Star Cosmetics Thank you for this post!

However, we‚Äôre here to realign your thought process, because there‚Äôs nothing sleazy about sleeping on silk, it‚Äôs actually THE bombest thing for your hair and skin. Sleeping on a silk pillowcase is SO much better than cotton; not only will it make you feel like a legit princess, you‚Äôll wake up with hair that no longer resembles a bird‚Äôs nest, and you can forget about those annoying sleep creases on your face. Seriously, you need to move on from your cotton pillowcase. Maybe you‚Äôve even heard all this before, but then thought, why would you fork out $60 when you already have a cotton pillowcase that gets the job done. Well, we‚Äôre here to tell you that getting the benefits of a silk pillowcase doesn‚Äôt need to be an investment and we found a satin-finish pillowcase on Amazon for less than $10 . Okay, so it‚Äôs not made of the finest silk, but it gives a silky finish that is sure to give better hair and skin benefits than your classic cotton pillowcase. The thing is, when you sleep on cotton pillowcases, the cotton ‚Äògrabs‚Äô your hair causing it to twist and stick, which is why you often wake up with frizz, and let‚Äôs be honest, a not-so-hot mess. The difference with silk and satin-finish pillowcases is your hair moves freely; there‚Äôs no friction or tugging, which means you wake up with smooth hair. Another weird thing you probably never knew, cotton draws moisture from your hair, which over time makes your hair brittle and more prone to damage, not to mention it‚Äôs literally absorbing your skincare and haircare products into the pillow that you sleep on every night, eww. Think about it; you spend at least 7 hours with your head on a pillow every night ‚Äì whether you‚Äôre Netflixing or sleeping ‚Äì so making the switch away from cotton really makes a lot of sense, for your skin and your hair! So, whether you fancy investing $60 in a real silk pillowcase (you spend a lot of time in bed, so the cost per use is less than a cent in just a couple of years), or you want to test the benefits first with a less expensive satin-finish pillowcase (like the ones we found on Amazon), it really might be the best thing you ever did!

But we‚Äôve got some pretty major news for those of you who rock an updo while catching some zzz‚Äôs‚Ä¶ It could be seriously damaging your hair; and the reason why no matter how much you spend on oils and serums, your hair still doesn‚Äôt look healthy. So, if you‚Äôre doing this to your hair, you need to stop, now! How wearing your hair up at night is damaging your hair If having your hair down at night irritates you like crazy, chances are you pile it up on top of your head, but this can actually cause a hair loss condition known as traction alopecia. Before you start to panic, don‚Äôt worry, traction alopecia won‚Äôt cause ALL your hair to fall out, but it can result in hair loss and significant thinning (around your hairline in particular), especially during prolonged periods, like those eight golden hours of beauty sleep! It‚Äôs triggered by the constant tugging and pulling when your hair is tied too tight; this constant strain causes your hair follicles to become inflamed, damaging them so that they‚Äôre unable to complete their growth cycle. As well as pulling your hair, friction between your hair tie and the pillow will also cause your hair particles to weaken, and split ends to emerge mid-length, resulting in even more damage. What to do instead: For those of you with long mermaid manes or any other hair type that‚Äôs prone to knotting, wear your hair in a loose, low pony or a braid for minimal strain. If you must wear it in a bun on the top of your head, use a scrunchie and tie it loosely, so there‚Äôs no tension on your hair. If you use an elastic band, the rubber can lead to breakage and split ends. It may sound extra AF, but invest in a silk pillowcase to reduce the level of friction on your hair; this will give you smoother, healthier hair. It‚Äôll also help your hair retain more moisture than if you were to use a cotton pillowcase, which is absorbent and soaks up your hair‚Äôs natural oils, leaving it dry and more prone to traction alopecia. If you‚Äôre still skeptical, read this ! If you don‚Äôt have the cash to splurge on a silk pillowcase, rummage through your grandma‚Äôs drawer for a silk scarf. It‚Äôll do the same job as a silk pillowcase while keeping your hair off your face, not to mention it totally channels old Hollywood glam. If you‚Äôve already noticed signs of hair thinning‚Ä¶ Don‚Äôt worry, traction alopecia isn‚Äôt permanent, but it‚Äôs essential that you catch it early and break the habit. Make sure you aren‚Äôt falling into any other common traps, like using the wrong brush, brushing it incorrectly or over styling.

Maybelline‚Äôs Instant Age Rewind Eraser Dark Circle Treatment Concealer has a really unique applicator, (a super long name), and a formula that just werks! The pigmentation is so impressive and it literally covers EVERYTHING ‚Äì for $9!! The formula even has anti-ageing goji berries, which are packed with antioxidants and collagen boosting amino acids. It also boasts a healthy dose of Haloxyl, a formula that targets dark circles by absorbing the pigment in blood that‚Äôs responsible for the color that causes dark circles. So not only are you covering your dark circles, every time you use it, you‚Äôre actually improving them too. I won‚Äôt lie, I‚Äôm not a huge fan of the micro-corrector cotton applicator because being a germophobe, I feel like it‚Äôs not that hygienic‚Ä¶ BUT the applicator works so perfectly on dark circles and it blends with the skin really smoothly so I can‚Äôt resist it ‚Äì it also lasts all day and doesn‚Äôt crease. This really is an amazing drugstore product for treating and concealing dark circles (I use shade medium), and if dark circles are getting you down, check out my DIY techniques for banishing dark circles here .

Bojana I love the concealer but sadly, there isn‚Äôt a shade light enough for my fair complexion which is kind of upsetting :/ i‚Äôve always had to mix it with a very light concealer, the formula of it wasn‚Äôt great at all but it did lighten the maybelline concealer Kimberley I have the same problem, I think that is the struggle for pale people Jyo Absolutely love the concealer, but I hate that there‚Äôs no testers at the store! I keep buying the wrong shade. What shade do you use (as I have a very similar complexion to you)? Bushra Love the concealor but it is extremely unhygienic. The applicator will never dry out It will always have product and then the residue sticks on to the cap Any suggestions on how to make it more cleaner ?? HB Team Hi gorgeous, I always use it at the beginning of the day when I‚Äôm doing my makeup, so that I know my skin is freshly clean. I would suggest not using it for any touch-ups during the day, as it‚Äôs more likely there will be oil and dirt on your skin at this point. xoxo Benedetta I suggest you to remove the sponge and it will easily come out and you will waste less product. Just a tip don‚Äôt twist it many times of it doesn‚Äôt come out right away or too much product will come out. Hope this will help you. üôÇ Aleena This Concealer is amazing!

This means not only is dry shampoo a must on our bathroom shelves, but so is an easy hairstyle that will disguise our roots. The best thing is, when our hair is greasy it‚Äôs actually in its most friendly styling stage, so cute braids, messy buns, and quirky pin-ups are made for your three-day-old hair ‚Äì who are we kidding, we push it to four or five days sometimes. To help you get the most out of your snooze button and that extra 20 minutes of beauty sleep, here are some seriously bomb hairstyles that look best when your hair‚Äôs dirty‚Ä¶ Werk-your-grease pony Make your oily roots work to your advantage! No matter how bad you think you are at doing your hair, you can master this slick pony, we promise! Brush your hair thoroughly, and then using a bristle brush, scrape your hair backward, gathering all your hair into one hand. Tie your pony high up on your head and take a small section from underneath to wrap around your hair elastic, then secure with bobby pins. Check out four more ways you can play with your slicked ponytail. The alternative messy bun! Okay, so some people find a messy bun to be the easiest hairstyle in the world, while the rest of us struggle to make it look cool and elegant and just end up looking like a 12-year-old ballerina. This is the perfect do for dirty hair, so if you need some direction, this fresh-twist on how to do a gorgeous messy bun is for you! Don‚Äôt forget the dry shampoo! The easiest crown braid ever This look gives us major summer vibes, but it‚Äôs so cute, why not wear it all year round? Not only is this super easy to do when your hair is greasy but because you end up wrapping your braids around the front of your head, it totally hides your greasy parting! If in doubt, put a headband on it! Sometimes the level of grease is bad, and on the days a hat in the office isn‚Äôt appropriate but you also really don‚Äôt want to wash your hair, a headband will be your BFF. And no, it‚Äôs not really preppy or old school, it‚Äôs basically the staple of any Dolce girl. A wide headband, bandana or ribbon will cover your greasy roots and look super cute.

Spoiler: They‚Äôre incredible. Time and money were no object to Louboutin, who had these scents brewing for three years until now. He went to four best perfume houses in the world and what they came up with is seriously incredible! It was so hard to pick favorites! The first one, Bikini Questa Sera (‚ÄúBikini Tonight‚Äù in Italian) is supposed to evoke an intimate, beachy feeling. The notes of jasmine, tuberose, and sandalwood. The second, Tornade Blonde aka ‚ÄúBlonde Tornado‚Äù is about a women who leaves a trail of golden light behind her. Picture you‚Äôre at a bar and see a gorgeous women who disappears in moments, leaving you wondering, ‚Äúwho was she?‚Äù (as the Louboutin team explained). It has a mix of violet, roses, and cassis. Finally, Trouble in Heaven is about a woman who is at ease with being sexy ‚Äì provokes and doesn‚Äôt mind being provocative. The scent is the strongest of the three, with notes of bergamot, amber, patchouli, and iris. The bottle itself is a work of art ‚Äì the clam shell is supposed to emulate a Caesar or Oscar award (and honestly, we want to display it on our shelves like one!). Louboutin actually enlisted an architect, Thomas Heatherwick (who also recently designed the new London double decker buses) to come up with a classic, strong design that really gives these scents a commanding identity. There‚Äôs a mix of complexity and simplicity in the design that we‚Äôd only expect from Louboutin. The perfumes are decadent, sexy, and quite honestly, to die for. They are all launched today at 1320 dhs in the UAE and $275 each in the US. Which perfume describes you? Anyone out to buy one for themselves? Like all Louboutin beauty products, we think this is something you‚Äôll use AND collect to display like works of art. The scents are so distinct, they‚Äôre perfect for layering as well. We‚Äôre seriously obsessed! Check them out at Louboutin stores, on Louboutin‚Äôs site , or online retailers like selfridges.com !

Fortunately, it‚Äôs the time of year when you literally have any excuse to get your glitter on and not have to explain yourself. And it‚Äôs not just that it‚Äôs the holidays; glitter is actually massively trending right now, so get yourself glittered up ‚Äì this is only the beginning! Even if wearing glitter does give you throwback vibes to your teen years, here are four very adult ways to wear glitter that will take your look to the next level this season: For your eyes You can keep it low-key and swap out your black liquid liner for glitter liner, or go for full glitter eyeshadow ‚Äì you do you! We‚Äôre also loving the new trend of glitter liner on the lower lashline; it‚Äôs the perfect way to add a fresh take on glitter liner. Check out our tutorial for gorgeous snow queen glitter eyeliner here . For your body In summer we love a bit of shoulder bling with our Huda Beauty 3D Highlighter for a sexy shimmer, but when it comes to festive partying, we‚Äôre all down for getting the glitter out! If you really want to stand out at a Christmas ball or your work event, a little glitter or gold leaf on your shoulders or collarbones will slay ‚Äì it‚Äôs not just for festivals, we promise! Our trick is to spread a thin layer of Vaseline on the area you want to add sparkle to first. For your nails If you‚Äôre a glitterphobe, this has to be the easiest way to add some sparkle to your life without having to go out of your comfort zone.

Balmain Hair Couture‚Äôs revolutionary extension application is literally unlike any other we‚Äôve ever seen, and Alya‚Äôs the first to try them in the Middle East! They‚Äôre the healthiest hair extensions EVER made, and they take just ONE HOUR to apply! They use real hair that‚Äôs treated to the highest quality ‚Äì BTW they supply Chanel and Christian Dior with hair for runways and photoshoots ‚Äì and every piece is multi-toned for dimension and a natural look. Even the bond is healthy for your hair: Balmain has created a revolutionary silk protein bond, which contains 17 out of the 19 amino acids that hair is built on, so there‚Äôs no glue or any damage to hair. Check out Alya getting the Balmain hair extensions done by Balmain‚Äôs genius hair technician Guido Rieger. Usually, you‚Äôd have to set aside a whole afternoon for hair extensions and styling, but we‚Äôre all busy people, so the possibility of getting a full makeover on our lunch break is a way more realistic option. Unfortunately, they don‚Äôt last forever, but you can keep your extensions for 6-8 weeks ‚Äì although Guido told us that technically they would be okay for up to 12 weeks if they‚Äôre really being taken care of. And as frustrating as styling extensions can be, Guido explained that the hair has ‚Äòmemory,‚Äô so even if you curl or straighten it, your style should last all day.

Glitter brows were the perfect Coachella-vibe look for summer, but metallic brows are the coolest way to work the trend into your fall wardrobe. So even though gold and glitter brows look super pretty, it‚Äôs not necessarily very wearable. Fortunately, I have just the trick to take the trend from catwalk to your closet. It‚Äôs really important to find the right color; I tried silver at first, but it made me look so old even though it looked cool in person ‚Äì in photos, it was more Halloween than hot! Then I tried Fling from our Rose Gold palette, and it looked super cute and pretty, and it still made me look like I had brows! How to do metallic brows: I did my brows as usual, mixed the eyeshadow with a setting spray and used a fine, flat brush to paint the color onto my eyebrows, and it looked so beautiful. You can even use a smaller amount to make it more wearable, instead of covering your whole brow.

Billy B has been such a huge part of my makeup obsession; he was an inspiration to me from the start.

Not only did Billy B tell us some amazing stories (most are top secret!), but he gave us a first look at the gorgeous Billy B x G√°ll√°ny Face and Eye Palette , which he collaborated on with G√°ll√°ny Cosmetics to create. Adding to his awesome collection of makeup brushes, he‚Äôs created the ultimate palette, that he says includes ‚Äú19 of the hardest working shades from my kit that I‚Äôve used on all my clients for the last 25 years.‚Äù This palette has everything: subtle, soft matte colors for contouring, shimmering shades for the eyes, gorgeous browns that work perfectly as eyeliner and for the brows, and pretty pink and peach shades that look gorgeous on the eye or the apples of your cheeks. The palette is Billy‚Äôs first ever collab, and it wasn‚Äôt until he met Ida G√†l-Csiszar, the chemist, and founder of G√°ll√°ny Cosmetics , that he even thought about making a palette. I have to say, G√°ll√°ny Cosmetics have done an amazing job with the palette, which joins their other collections of lipsticks, dazzling lip glosses, face palettes, highlighters, and bronzers.

Spoiler: They‚Äôre incredible. Time and money were no object to Louboutin, who had these scents brewing for three years until now. He went to four best perfume houses in the world and what they came up with is seriously incredible! It was so hard to pick favorites! The first one, Bikini Questa Sera (‚ÄúBikini Tonight‚Äù in Italian) is supposed to evoke an intimate, beachy feeling. The notes of jasmine, tuberose, and sandalwood. The second, Tornade Blonde aka ‚ÄúBlonde Tornado‚Äù is about a women who leaves a trail of golden light behind her. Picture you‚Äôre at a bar and see a gorgeous women who disappears in moments, leaving you wondering, ‚Äúwho was she?‚Äù (as the Louboutin team explained). It has a mix of violet, roses, and cassis. Finally, Trouble in Heaven is about a woman who is at ease with being sexy ‚Äì provokes and doesn‚Äôt mind being provocative. The scent is the strongest of the three, with notes of bergamot, amber, patchouli, and iris. The bottle itself is a work of art ‚Äì the clam shell is supposed to emulate a Caesar or Oscar award (and honestly, we want to display it on our shelves like one!). Louboutin actually enlisted an architect, Thomas Heatherwick (who also recently designed the new London double decker buses) to come up with a classic, strong design that really gives these scents a commanding identity. There‚Äôs a mix of complexity and simplicity in the design that we‚Äôd only expect from Louboutin. The perfumes are decadent, sexy, and quite honestly, to die for. They are all launched today at 1320 dhs in the UAE and $275 each in the US. Which perfume describes you? Anyone out to buy one for themselves? Like all Louboutin beauty products, we think this is something you‚Äôll use AND collect to display like works of art. The scents are so distinct, they‚Äôre perfect for layering as well. We‚Äôre seriously obsessed! Check them out at Louboutin stores, on Louboutin‚Äôs site , or online retailers like selfridges.com !

That‚Äôs one of the reasons I started my blog; I wanted beauty to be accessible to everyone. This summer, I saw the difference beauty can make confirmed when my sister Alya asked me to give her a complete makeover. Of course, I couldn‚Äôt wait to help her feel more beautiful and see her more confident! Alya isn‚Äôt obsessed with makeup like my sister Mona and I, it‚Äôs just not something she‚Äôs crazy about, and her appearance isn‚Äôt something she focuses on ‚Äì she‚Äôll tell you that herself. She often forgets her skincare routine, isn‚Äôt fussed about having mani and pedis all the time, and is just generally a very low maintenance kinda gal, but she really wanted a huge change‚Ä¶ So, we went all out! Alya‚Äôs Complete Makeover: One of the main things Alya wanted to change was her hair and the texture of her skin. So, we took full advantage of being in LA over the summer and visited the best salons and clinics. I took her to see skin expert to half of Hollywood, Nurse Jamie . She‚Äôs the trusted beauty guru to celebs like Jessica Alba, the Kardashians, and Rita Ora, and I‚Äôm obsessed with her super-advanced anti-aging techniques. I love that Nurse Jamie is all about enhancing your natural beauty and making you the most beautiful version of yourself without invasive techniques; she was the perfect person to help give Alya confidence in her skin again. FACE: Alya previously had cheek fillers, but they weren‚Äôt in the right place, so as Alya puts it, they gave her ‚Äòchipmunk‚Äô cheeks. Nurse Jamie, the ultimate filler expert, reduced the filler in Alya‚Äôs cheeks and under her eyes, by injecting hyaluronidase (an enzyme that speeds up the natural breakdown of hyaluronic acid fillers like Juvederm), and defined the cheekbones to give her a more contoured look. Nurse Jamie also used her filler skills on Alya‚Äôs lips, reshaping them, evening them out, and adding fullness to the top lip with Juvederm Vobella . Finally, Nurse Jamie worked her magic and retextured Alya‚Äôs skin to make it more even-toned using pixel laser therapy. The laser creates thousands of microscopic perforations in the surface of the skin, which prompts the skin to produce new collagen, leaving the skin smoother and more even-toned. EYEBROWS: Everyone knows that the eyebrows completely transform the face, so this summer we all got our brows done by the incredibly skilled Microblading LA team . Our wonderful brow artist Lindsey Ta added fullness to Alya‚Äôs eyebrows and lifted them slightly by raising the outer arch for a more youthful and fresh look. HAIR: Alya has been set on having her hair longer for soo long! A few months ago, Balmain added extensions to Alya‚Äôs hair for volume, but it was length that she was really craving. We went all out and added super long extensions (22 pieces of 20-inch extensions), and added soft honey tones to warm up her complexion and give her the ‚ÄòJ-Lo look‚Äô she wanted. Between bleaching, Alya got a keratin treatment to improve the strength of the hair before the color was added. Finally, Alya received a Brazilian Blowout to eliminate frizz and give shine, which maintains the health of the hair and lasts for around 12 weeks. Alya was so happy with the final result of her hair she was intent on calling her transformation ratchet to Rapunzel üòÇ SKINCARE: I‚Äôm still working on skincare with Alya, but she is super tricky because she gets so lazy with her cleansing routine! Luckily, Alya is naturally gorgeous, but she wants to wake up looking completely flawless without putting effort into her beauty routine, so I‚Äôm trying to make it as easy as possible for her to follow. I‚Äôve given her five essential products to help smooth the texture of her skin, brighten her complexion, and keep any fine lines at bay: Clinique Clarifying Lotion 2: I love using this Clinique formula before my moisturizer, and it‚Äôs perfect for Alya‚Äôs slightly dry skin. It gets rid of any flaky skin and removes oil leaving your skin super fresh and your pores tighter. Dr. Doris Day‚Äôs Silky Foam Cleansing Mousse: This cleansing mouse by skincare expert Dr. Doris Day gets rid of all the dirt and oil that builds up during the day. It uses Lactic and Salicylic acids that exfoliate the skin gently and effectively. SkinCeuticals Skin Firming Cream: I swear by this cream ! It has incredible ingredients that are ideal for mature skin like mine and Alya‚Äôs, as it firms the skin, hydrates, and helps to tone and fight against aging caused by environmental damage. REN Rose O¬π¬≤ Moisture Defence Oil : Every time I use this oil it makes my skin SO soft! It contains awesome oils like Jojoba seed, cranberry seed, and rose oils that soothe, soften and condition the skin, providing vital nutrients, vitamins, and antioxidants so your skin can lock in moisture. Dr. Doris Day‚Äôs Light &amp; Bright Brightening Pads: These brightening pads contain some major ingredients that naturally exfoliate. Hydroxy acids penetrate deep into the skin and accelerate skin renewal, which helps reduce hyperpigmented cells. Alya uses this twice a week as her skin is very uneven. BODY: Even though Alya is obsessed with fitness and is in amazing shape, she wanted to target some stubborn fat on her arms and waist. Nurse Jamie used her incredible SculpSure technique, which can reduce up to 23% fat in less than 30 minutes ‚Äì I know, incredible! It‚Äôs the world‚Äôs first FDA cleared laser for permanent, localized fat reduction that works to break down fats and other lipids. It takes 4-6 weeks to see results with the full result showing from 3 months: Alya is already noticing a difference. EYES: Literally every day since Alya was about 15, she‚Äôs worn colored contact lenses because she‚Äôs nearsighted. Alya finally had Lasik surgery, so she no longer needs to wear contacts ‚Äì although she is majorly missing her lighter eyes. NAILS: Maintenance is something Alya hates, so she‚Äôll usually get her mani and pedi every 2-3 weeks. Mona and I have finally persuaded her to come for weekly pamper sessions at the Dollhouse with us. The Result: It‚Äôs been so incredible seeing how all these tiny little changes have made such a huge difference to how Alya feels about herself. It‚Äôs amazing to work with the best beauty experts, but it also really highlights the importance of finding the right doctors. Always make sure you see a verified doctor, because it‚Äôs all about enhancing your natural self, not changing your appearance, and finding the right doctor will make the biggest difference! We‚Äôre still working to improve Alya‚Äôs skincare routine and her wardrobe, so stay tuned for part two of Alya‚Äôs makeover.

But where does it stand in the spectrum of eyebrow needs? Here‚Äôs what we thought: What it is: A waxy, tinted brow gel housed in a sleek mini, black compact. What it does: With the help of a brow brush, waxy pigmented gel can easily help fill in sparse areas of the brows. What we loved: True to the Bobbi Brown spirit, this is best for a more natural approach to brows. The combo of pigment and beeswax helps achieve a natural, fuller look. It feels a bit like pomade for brows. We found it‚Äôs best for filling in sparse areas of the brows without looking like overkill. The color range (17 total) are also very close to natural hair colors (we love Saddle for brunettes) and shades for highlights to give hair the look of texture. What we didn‚Äôt like: While great for filling in brows, because of its waxy nature, it‚Äôs not the best for buildable, detailed work (such as defined strokes mimicking the look of natural hairs). A good pick if you‚Äôre looking for a little more volume with a more natural approach to brows. Also note, while it is water-, sweat-, and humidity- resistant, it can still rub off by mistake.

It takes forever‚Äìsometimes, an hour and a half! Why? My hair is super curly. dry, damaged and frizz-prone. All the reason more why I need to make sure I get my locks super straight if I want to look anywhere close to sane when I leave the house. Being the product whore that I am, I had to find the perfect product that would help me extend the life of my blowout, even a day! After trying countless products, natural rinses and ‚Äúremedies‚Äù, I was beginning to think if I wanted to extend the life of my blowout in any way, it was going to result in a starchy film on my hair follicles or scalp, gross! Luckily, my Sephora-product-guru is a rockstar! She listened to all of my complaints (if you haven‚Äôt figured it out yet, I am beyond critical and picky with products) and turned me on to Ojon‚Äôs dry shampoo. Wow! What a difference! Ojon‚Äôs dry shampoo is much finer than the traditional formulas you find, so it doesn‚Äôt give you the same starchy feeling most dry shampoos do. Not only that, but itgives you incredible volume, erases impurities and toxins, smells fantastic and comes in travel size for your purse! I have now been using this product for 3 years and this, my friends, is a staple!

Like, I always do my brows before foundation, and I always do my mascara after eyeshadow, but I know so many people do those the other way around. Regardless of my makeup phases, the different products I use, and all the unusual techniques I try, there‚Äôs one product that I literally can not do my makeup without, and it‚Äôs something you can pick up for literally $2 at any drugstore. My life-saving beauty essential? It‚Äôs Q-tips, but more specifically, Muji‚Äôs Thin Cotton Buds ‚Äì they are so super fine, about half the size of a normal Q-tip. I mean Q-tips, in general, are a lifesaver, but these super-fine-ended Q-tips are ahhhhmazing; they‚Äôre really really precise, so they‚Äôre perfect for cleaning up my brows and getting rid of any lash glue that ends up on my lids. But really, there‚Äôs so much more to a Q-tip when it comes to makeup. Here‚Äôre some awesome hacks that will not only make your makeup routine quicker and easier, but cheaper too: Hide a Pimple: Instead of buying a tiny, dense concealer brush, a Q-tip can do the job just as well, if not better! Not only will you get a precise application, but because it‚Äôs disposable, it means there‚Äôs no risk of spreading bacteria, so you don‚Äôt need to wash it every time like you should with a brush. Once you‚Äôve applied concealer, you can dip the other end in powder to set your cream concealer. Perfect Your Varnish: The smaller the Q-tip, the better. The skinny Muji cotton buds are literally a dream when it comes to cleaning up messy nail varnish. Your left hand might look neat and tidy, but when it comes to painting your right hand, well, it can look like you let a six-year-old loose on your nails (trust me, I know what that looks like!). Just dip the Q-tip in nail varnish remover and wipe it around your cuticles to get rid of any smudges. Get Flawless Eyeliner: We all know getting the perfect cat-eye is something no amount of years can perfect, it‚Äôs one of those things we‚Äôve accepted we‚Äôll only ever be able to do on a very rare occasion (except if you use the Vamp Stamp ). Enter the Q-tip, your best friend for wiping away your liner mistakes. Dip the Q-tip in a little moisturizer or micellar water and gently neaten up your liner. Save on Makeup Brushes: Avoid shelling out for pointed makeup brushes and use a Q-tip for smoking out eyeliner along your lower lash line. Q-tips are also perfection for adding eyeshadow to your crease ‚Äì especially in the corner of your eyes ‚Äì and applying glitter, so you‚Äôre not forever washing your brush to get rid of left over glitter.

I‚Äôve said this before, no matter how great you are at putting makeup on, if you are not healthy (and happy), you just won‚Äôt look as glamorous as someone who is extremely healthy wearing no makeup! I know you guys have seen it‚Äìgorgeous makeup + unhealthy girl = not pretty! Trust me, I‚Äôve been there! Which is why eating healthy is imperative to women and men who really want to maintain their youth! My hubby is impossible! No matter how much I try to tell him he needs to keep his skin hydrated, he just will NOT let me put any creams on his face! Sooo I was able to change his diet and WOW, what a difference! A few things I did was up his berry intak e, get him drinking cleansing tea almost every day and eating oatmeal (which he loved, so that was easy, I just kept telling him how healthy it was). Oatmeal is UNBELIEVABLY healthy and if you love beauty, you MUST keep it stocked! It‚Äôs a beauty staple! Not only does it make some of the best at home face scrubs and body soaks , but it helps keep you beautiful inside out! It‚Äôs high in iron, fiber, phosphorous, manganese, calcium, silicon and vitamins B and E. All of these ingredients help keep your skin looking and feeling great!

We all want them ‚Äì I definitely do. The unfortunate problem is our bushy brow dreams of today are often hard to achieve. Fortunately, there are tons of ways to get your brows looking gorgeous and full, and the latest product for full brows isn‚Äôt a pencil or pomade, it‚Äôs fake hair encapsulated in a gel formula! I actually tried sticking individual lash hairs to my brows last year to see how it looked, so I was psyched when I saw the Reallyyy 3D Eyebrow Extension Fiber. We reposted this crazy fake brow product on our IG in December, and I just had to try it for myself. What it is: A clear, gel, glue-like formula containing hair-like fibers. The formula comes in a pot with a fine-tipped brush. What it does: The gel can recreate the look of natural brow hairs to visibly fill in the brow. First impressions: When I first opened the product, it looked kind of gunky, a bit like hair that you pull out of your sink. I tried applying the product straight to my brow, which really didn‚Äôt work very well. You need to apply the product to the back of your hand, pick up as few hairs as you can on a small flat brush, and place them one by one in the areas you want to add volume. You could even use tweezers to get the best application, but this could be quite time-consuming. A post shared by Huda Kattan (@hudabeauty) on Jan 8, 2018 at 6:43am PST What I didn‚Äôt like: This product will take some practice to get it looking good, as it didn‚Äôt look very natural at first. Once it sets, the hair placing can‚Äôt be fixed, so you need to make sure you get the hairs in the right position straight away. I tried to clean up my brows with concealer after I applied the product, which didn‚Äôt look good, as anywhere the glue is, it makes it look like your skin is almost peeling. The gel is tacky and sticky, and when you use it all over your brow it doesn‚Äôt feel nice at all, and when it dries it just feels a bit like plaster, so I recommend to use this sparingly in the areas needed. What I liked: I love that this is so innovative, and such a simple concept. It‚Äôs really good for adding depth to the front of your brows, especially if you don‚Äôt have many brow hairs there and you want to bring your brows further in (it makes your nose look slimmer! ). The verdict: This is a cool product and worth a try if you‚Äôre looking to fill in your brows in the most natural way possible. I would suggest doing your brows as usual with a product that has a lot of staying power, and then sparingly applying this on top. Using just the gel only took me a few minutes to do my brows (it was quite a frustrating process), but I would definitely use it again at the front of my eyebrows after I‚Äôve applied my usual product. If you have very sparse brows, I think microblading or simply filling in your brows using a fine brow pencil in hair-like strokes is a better option, as using this product alone would take a lot of time to make it look natural on sparse brows.

How can someone‚Äôs hair be THAT shiny, and how can their skin be SO dewy? Seriously?! So you can imagine how psyched we were when we discovered the products they use literally cost less than a few dollars and are some of our FAV natural beauty DIYs. Check out these six insanely cool (and super easy) beauty hacks Hollywood‚Äôs most gorgeous celebs swear by. Jennifer Aniston‚Äôs Secret To Youth I think we can all agree that Jennifer Aniston looks pretty bomb ‚Äì none of us actually believe that she is 48! Our FAV Friends actress claims using Vaseline under her eyes every single night is the secret to her youthful eyes and enviably smooth under-eyes, and for a couple of dollars, we‚Äôre definitely going to try this out. Find out more Vaseline hacks here . Miranda Kerr‚Äôs Glow Alternative Miranda is basically the ultimate poster girl for glowing skin; she is always radiant! Aside from the fact it‚Äôs slightly irritating that anyone can have skin that naturally glows so luminously, her tip for switching out highlighter is pretty genius. Miranda says on her down days; she uses ChapStick or lip balm instead of highlighter to give her skin a natural, lit-from-within glow. Considering most of us have at least three lip balms lying around our homes somewhere, needless to say, this incredibly simple, but effective tip, is our new off-duty essential. Beyonce‚Äôs Sweet Tip for Kissable Lips There‚Äôs no denying that Beyonce is completely flawless in every way, and we‚Äôre certain she did wake up as perfect as she is. Fortunately for us, her amazing makeup artist Sir John shared one of his rituals for soft lips he uses on Beyonce‚Ä¶ A mix of honey and brown sugar to make an all-natural scrub for Beyonce‚Äôs lips, which creates a perfectly smooth canvas for lipsticks. Not only does it make your lips incredibly kissably soft, but honey is also super nourishing and moisturizing. Adriana Lima‚Äôs Hack For Shiny Hair If we‚Äôre going to take beauty tips from anyone, the Victoria‚Äôs Secret supermodels are on the top of our list. Not only is Adrianna Lima completely flawless in every way, but she knows a thing or two about budget-friendly beauty. Her hack for her incredibly glossy, catwalk-worthy hair? She swears by avocados, and it actually works miracles! Check out our DIY avocado hair mask . The A-List Cure-All Obsession There‚Äôs such a lengthy list of celebs touting the beneficial properties of green tea that we‚Äôve lost track, but with devotees including Jennifer Lopez, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Lady Gaga, we know it‚Äôs a winner. Whether you drink green tea or apply it to your skin, it has some pretty magical properties that have turned HB HQ into religious green tea drinkers. Check out our favorite ways to use green tea and find out all the awesome things it can do for your body here . Scarlett Johansson‚Äôs DIY Anti-Aging Toner Considering Scarlett looks the same now as she did ten years ago ‚Äì yes, that What Goes Around Video with Justin Timberlake was made in 2007, and yes, she still looks that hot! Despite that all being incredibly unfair, we can at least jump on her skincare regime, and it will cost you just a few dollars. Scarlett has been a long-time fan of apple cider vinegar as a toner because she prefers to use natural ingredients instead of harsh chemical. Apple cider vinegar has insane properties that not only make it amazing as an anti-aging, anti-acne toner, but it can also help you lose weight and get glossy hair. Find out other ways apple cider vinegar is awesome and how to use it as a DIY toner here . beauty hacks celeb beauty hacks diy natural ingredients Thu, 31 Aug 2017 1 Comment Related Posts This Is What You Need To Do For Sexy Smooth Skin In Winter Wed, 8 Nov 2017 Adriana Lima Gave Me Her Secret To Shiny Hair‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ Wed, 17 May 2017 The Ultimate Hack for Super Soft Lips Sun, 28 May 2017 Sayeedah Juman I love it!

But we all have a staple arsenal of beauty products, those essential items we reach for almost every day without fail. Well, the products that I can‚Äôt live without and that I use every day are all from the drugstore. These three beauty staples are essentials for me: whether I‚Äôm being particularly lazy, need my makeup to look flawless, or if I‚Äôm just perfecting my winged liner‚Ä¶ The Drugstore Product I Can‚Äôt Do My Makeup Without I think I probably go through a box of these in a month because I use them for everything, but that‚Äôs fine because you can literally get 100 for like $2! I‚Äôm talking about Q-Tips, those little bundles of cotton on the end of a stick have been a savior in my makeup routine for as long as I can remember. But my absolute favorite is Muji‚Äôs Thin Cotton Buds ‚Äì they‚Äôre super skinny and much finer than the regular cotton buds you might use, which means they‚Äôre twice as helpful for cleaning up makeup mistakes and other beauty hacks. Check out my four Q-Tip hacks here and where to shop Muji cotton buds. This Drugstore Beauty Dupe Will Airbrush Any Foundation If you didn‚Äôt know by now, your foundation is not the only reason for flawless skin. Any foundation no matter how much you spend on it can look terrible if it‚Äôs applied badly, but that doesn‚Äôt mean you have to be an MUA to boast the most perfectly blended, seamless foundation! Great skin is all about technique, but there‚Äôs one tool that can make anyone a master at foundation blending‚Ä¶ a beauty sponge! I‚Äôve been a huge fan of the beautyblender ever since it was released; the squishy pink egg makes smoothing foundation super easy, but at $20 it‚Äôs not affordable considering it should be replaced every three months! That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve become obsessed with the Real Techniques Miracle Complexion Sponge, $11 for two ; they‚Äôre an amazing dupe for the beautyblender. Read my full review and blending tips here . The Drugstore Product Everyone Should Own It‚Äôs 2017, and we‚Äôre living a more fast-paced life than ever before. When it comes to even some of the most basic beauty chores, we just really CBA, anything to make our lives easier and hassle-free is appreciated, anything! From makeup wipes instead of washing our faces (naughty) to a spritz of dry shampoo in favor of a longer lie-in: Both are shortcuts I take advantage of on a weekly basis. Seriously though, I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôd do without dry shampoo in between washing my hair, it helps it to appear fresh, clean, gives me volume, and helps keep my style in place, so it‚Äôs basically my answer to a hairspray that cleans! I‚Äôm obsessed with Ouai Dry Shampoo Foam , but it was Batiste that started my love for dry shampoo, in particular, their XXL Volume Boost formula, $9 , is THE bomb.com. beauty hacks drugstore beauty drugstore beauty products Mon, 25 Sep 2017 8 Comments Related Posts Broke Girl‚Äôs Guide: Our Fav 10 Beauty Products Under $10 Tue, 28 Nov 2017 Airbrush Any Foundation With This Drugstore Beauty Dupe Sun, 9 Jul 2017 The Drugstore Product I Can‚Äôt Do My Makeup Without Sun, 30 Jul 2017 Niveda Nahta I‚Äôm in love with your products really!!!

Literally, any excuse to eat chocolate and we‚Äôre there: our friend‚Äôs birthday, it‚Äôs the weekend, it‚Äôs Monday, we need energy, chocolate goes well with coffee, it‚Äôs on offer ‚Äì there are loads of reasons to eat chocolate! But, what if you didn‚Äôt need to find an excuse to eat chocolate? Imagine if it was good for you, like if it had 6000 times the power of vitamin C, and the same health benefits you‚Äôd get from eating superfoods ‚Äì you‚Äôd be pretty intrigued, right? Well, we discovered anti-aging chocolate called Esthechoc, and it might just be our chocolate superhero. Esthechoc isn‚Äôt just any dark chocolate, it‚Äôs award-winning chocolate developed by the Cambridge Research Center in the UK, which is scientifically proven to enhance your skin. Esthechoc claims to boost antioxidant levels and increase circulation, preventing lines and promoting the youthful appearance of your skin. It gets better, you‚Äôre meant to eat one bar a day (we‚Äôre already sold), and as each bar only has 38kcal, we‚Äôre not mad at all! The tiny, tasty chocolate bars ‚Äì we have to hide them from certain HB HQ members ‚Äì have the same health benefits of eating a 300g serving of wild Alaskan salmon (500kcal) and 100g of dark chocolate (600kcal). Dark chocolate has long been reputed for its health benefits; it‚Äôs rich in antioxidants, nutrients, and vitamins, but Esthechoc is formulated with two unique ingredients that have been clinically proven to provide strong anti-aging effects without the massive intake of calories. (*nibbles on a bar of Esthechoc). How it works: Esthechoc is infused with a potent combination of two strong antioxidants, Epicatechins, which are found naturally in dark chocolate, and Astaxanthin, nature‚Äôs strongest antioxidant known to science, which is 6000 times more powerful than vitamin C, and 500 times more effective than vitamin E ‚Äì we‚Äôre impressed! The chocolate is designed to fight against the damage that our skin gets on a daily basis: from environmental pollution, UV rays, capillary degeneration, and poor diet. Over time these stresses lead to a breakdown of collagen in your skin, a lack of elasticity and firmness, poor skin hydration, cellulite, and slow skin cell turnover. What it does: Esthechoc is like a shield against the effects of environmental aging, supporting skin nutrition, maintaining healthy oxygen levels, detoxing, firming, and protecting your skin. One small bar a day can improve your skin in just three weeks by boosting skin microcirculation, improving oxygen transport in plasma, and a lot of other pretty genius science stuff that enhances the quality of your skin on a daily basis. After eight weeks, you can see a noticeable difference in crow‚Äôs feet, skin elasticity, and sebum balance on your cheeks. Where to get it: You can order the chocolate online at primemarkme.com , a 30 day supply will cost you $70, just over $2 per daily bar of chocolate. Of course, we have to put this chocolate to the test, as dedicated beauty lovers, it‚Äôs our duty to review the chocolate and see the results for ourselves. Stay tuned for an update; we‚Äôll be trying out the chocolate over a period of a month to see if we notice any difference in our skin. Whether we see results or not, it‚Äôs a great excuse to eat chocolate every day. What do you think, would you be tempted to try this chocolate?

Ramadan is here and so is summer, and we‚Äôre all super excited! It‚Äôs a time when you go on a spiritual cleanse and try to be the best version of yourself: that means being kind, patient, and humble while also evaluating what‚Äôs most important in life and helping people as much as you can. But it‚Äôs also a challenge for Muslims because you can‚Äôt drink or eat from sunrise to sunset, (or say bad words)! And it‚Äôs not just our stomachs that fasting effects, the lack of hydration through the day definitely has a tremendous impact on our skin too, and although it‚Äôs the largest organ, it‚Äôs actually one of the last things that gets the hydration it needs. So, during Ramadan, it can be really hard to achieve that beautiful supple, glowy and hydrated look‚Ä¶ But fortunately, there are SO many ways you can cheat it! One of the first places dehydration shows is on your lips, and not only is chapped and cracking lips uncomfortable, but it‚Äôs also not very attractive‚Ä¶ and there‚Äôs no reason you shouldn‚Äôt look your best during this period! Here‚Äôs what I like to do to keep my lips soft and hydrated during Ramadan: DIY Honey Mask: One of my favorite ways to keep my lips soft and supple during Ramadan is a honey mask. It‚Äôs super easy, just slather your lips in honey every night before you go to bed, and just leave it on for 10 to 15 minutes before removing it. Honestly, this works wonders! Lanolin Products: During the day, a good lip balm is an essential. I‚Äôve always found products with Lanolin in to have THE most amazing moisturizing properties, and it‚Äôs actually because it‚Äôs a completely natural ingredient that comes from sheep‚Äôs fleeces. My favorite pure lanolin lip balms to date have to be Lanolips (which literally lasts allll day) and Dr. Lipp . Carmex is also a brilliant and contains lanolin, beeswax, shea butter, Menthol, and Aloe, which all work together to really soothe your lips. DIY Balm Take your lanolin lip balm (or another lip balm) and whip it up in a mini container with a couple of drops of rose oil. This is totally optional, but rose oil has the most amazing hydrating effects. Be sure to drink as much water as you can in the evenings so your body can catch up on the hydration it needs. dry skin Lip balm ramadan skin hydration Sun, 28 May 2017 8 Comments Related Posts 3 Tips For Kissably Soft Lips This Winter Wed, 13 Dec 2017 Sheep‚Äôs Wool for Softer Lips?!

About a year ago, my hair was seriously dry and completely lifeless! It had noooo shine and it would constantly frizz at the thought of going outside, it was terrible! I did many things to improve my hair, but one of the biggest changes , and I‚Äôve said this before, was I changed the way I ate! I have spoken before about how increasing my Omega 3 intake made my hair super shiny , but my hair also became super thick once I started eating lean proteins! It almost increased about 1/3, I swear, it was amazing! What did I eat? Walnuts, Fish, Eggs, Low Fat Dairy Products (I ate a lot of Yogurt), and I added a little Soy (remember as a woman, we need to make sure not to eat too much Soy). image credits iamstyleish beauty blog blogger diet Dubai east fall Fashion get hair Hair Care hb health how huda long Makeup middle out Pityriasis simplex capillitii prevent Shampoo shopping thick thicker to Types uae vitamin Thu, 30 Dec 2010 10 Comments Related Posts The BEST Way to Wash Your Hair, Start doing this NOW!

Continue drinking your prenatal vitamins and eat as you said and hair will grow back faster! i just wanted you to know, it can be very scary if you were not prepared and wondering whats happening! I knew about it (my mom had bald patches after my sister) and yet, when it started shedding I got scared, it was too much! Shazia Agreed. I‚Äôve replaced cereal with eggs for my usual daily breakfast and I‚Äôve noticed a major change in my skin and hair since.

With all the humidity, let‚Äôs face it, our hair just doesn‚Äôt like us as much! Adjusting to climate change is essential not only with your wardrope, but especially your hair! Here are my summer tips for taking the best care of your mane. Get UV Protected! The sun is so powerful and the heat can do a great number on your hair. One of the best ways to protect your hair during the summer, is to buy a UV protector for your hair. One of my favorite products for sun protection is the Redken ColorExtend which has soplexyl, which helps prevent sun damage. Simply spray it on before you leave the house. Go Easy on the Blowdry! We all love perfectly styled hair, but with the humidity and heat, it‚Äôs best to let your hair go au naturale. If you must blowdry, try to skip one in between! When I do blowdry my hair, I use Kerastase Oleo Relax serum with Morrocan Oil , which seriously fights frizz! Fake the Beach! A great way to prolong a blowout is to spray your hair with a curl spray. I love the Bumble &amp; Bumble Surf Spray . It literally looks like I went to the beach and it‚Äôs a great way to style my hair before the next blowdry! Right when my hair is ready to wash, I take one extra day to get a great beach inspired do, and your friends will love it! Keep it Real! If you do want to go with your natural curls, try using a good cream that can fight humidity. I like to use Frederic Fekkai‚Äôs Lucious Curl Cream for the summer, which keeps my curls beautiful all day long! Be an Opportunist! Take advantage of the sun! When ever I know I will be in the sun, I take the chance to put a great hydrating mask on my hair and let the sun‚Äôs heat really soak it in! I usually use coconut oil or vatika oil, but really any type of hair mask, oil, treatment, etc, will work! Quick Note: If you can‚Äôt find the Morrocan Oil in Dubai or wherever you are, try any Argan Oil, I know Kiehl‚Äôs has a selection of Argan Oils. Since Bumble &amp; Bumble is also hard to find, for the Surf Spray, try mixing a cup of water with a tablespoon of sea salt and spray on your hair. image courtesy of agirlsgottaspa argan at beach blow bumble coconut color curl dry extend fekkai frederic frizz hair home kerastase kiehl's lucious mask morrocan oil oleo redken relax soplexyl spray summer surf waves Sat, 26 Jun 2010 7 Comments Related Posts The Product You NEED for Gorgeous Beach Waves Mon, 3 Oct 2016 My New Secret Weapon: Dallas Thickening Spray Sun, 22 Jan 2017 How I Get Sleek Hair Without Any Damage!

Heck yeah! And one of those statements is being with the latest trends! Growing up in a small city in Tennessee, I still always wanted to know the latest trends to come out of Paris and New York. Things haven‚Äôt changed too much! With winter being just around the corner, here are some of my favorite hair trends to start wearing now and through the cold! (above: Ombre Hair, perfect to soften features and keep hair looking super trendy! This look has been made famous by celebrities including Drew Berrymore and Rachel Bilson! Perfect for any women who loves highlights in the summer and wants to stay trendy) Luscious Soft Curls look great on nearly face shape and seem to suit every women, no matter how her features are set. Super feminine and classy, this look is a great day look that looks well put together and chic! Side swept bangs are perfect for women who have larger features and want may not be able to rock blunt bangs! This is a great way to make bangs work, while softening your features! Sleek Strands are super sultry and make the great winter companion! They say winter in a very haute way! I love how simplistic they are and since winter can be very dry, it‚Äôs a great time to skip a wash if possible and opt for a dry shampoo! Fiery Red Locks, Christina Hendricks has literally made red hair the hottest thing on the planet! Yes, she‚Äôs super seductive, but aside from a killer curvy figure, her red hair is super bold and simply unforgettable! It really makes her stand out! Blunt Bobs are super classic and mod, but also hard to pull off. Blunt bangs seem to put focus on the face and draw attention to features like a large nose, etc. image credits zimbio beauty blog bob celebrity Christina Hendricks Dubai fall Fringe (hair) gaga hair huda lady New York ombre paris Rachel Bilson Red hair runway short styles Tennessee trends winter Thu, 11 Nov 2010 4 Comments Related Posts How I Get Sleek Hair Without Any Damage!

I completely LOVE their use of color, so it‚Äôs no surprise to me to find out one of the things they are known for within the world of makeup luxury is their use of amazing pigment! When they launched their Rouge Pur Couture Vernis A Levres Glossy Stain (I know, loooong name), I was immediately attracted to it! The packaging, the ad campaign, reviews, everything really made me want to try it! I have to say, this product really delivered, but in such a unique way! It last soooo long and gives you the glossiest lips you will ever have! Unlike most glosses that have great staying power, this one doesn‚Äôt leave your lips feeling super dry after wards! It actually makes your lips feel hydrated‚Äìthe texture is really interesting! I don‚Äôt know how to explain the texture, but it kind of feels like a thick gloss, but it‚Äôs not sticky! It‚Äôs definitely the first of it‚Äôs kind to feel that way! The one thing I didn‚Äôt like, the lighter glosses streaked a bit, and for those, you have to be careful when applying! I recommend NOT pressing your lips together for the lighter ones, since it can leave blotchy patches! Other than that, this product is a really great product for any girl who loves to wear gloss! You won‚Äôt need to re apply it for hours! Very impressed with the staying power!

That said, there‚Äôs no reason you can‚Äôt continue to be the badass girl boss that you are the other three weeks of the month, and having a period that‚Äôs chill af is totally possible ‚Äì we promise! So, to make your time of the month a little more zen, we‚Äôve got the top tips on how to conquer PMS once and for all. Never be caught off guard There‚Äôs nothing worse being surprised by your period when you could‚Äôve sworn you weren‚Äôt due for another week. To make sure this never happens, track your period not just in your diary but by using apps like Clue and MyFlo . It can literally tell you everything, from the date that you‚Äôre due to the day you‚Äôll most likely experience cramps, and when you‚Äôll be heaviest. MyFlo will even tell you what food and workouts you should be doing at certain times so that you‚Äôre more productive and less likely to feel the typical painful symptoms. Oil up! Essential oils are the answer to your problems, which means you can ditch the pharmaceuticals. Essential oils heal naturally, so grab any oil that is known for soothing like lavender or chamomile. Our favorite oil to pop into the diffuser is Ylang Ylang as it has sedative and antispasmodic properties, which help reduce cramps and mood swings. If you don‚Äôt have a diffuser, you can put a couple of drops in your bath or dilute it with a carrier oil (like coconut oil) and massage it directly on to your stomach. Eat with your period in mind It‚Äôs time to put the chocolate down and resist those cravings because fatty, sugary foods are only going to heighten your PMS ‚Äì although let‚Äôs be honest, we‚Äôll probably still nibble on some chocolate! You only crave these foods because your serotonin levels are running low and although they‚Äôll give you a quick fix, it‚Äôs not what your body really needs. Instead eat foods that are packed with iron , (or take iron supplements) like spinach, quinoa, and dark chocolate (we got you covered), as these can help prevent anemia, triggered by the loss of blood during menstruation. Bananas are also a great sweet alternative as they release glucose and potassium at a steady rate so that they‚Äôll elevate your mood for longer, while they‚Äôll also get rid of that irritating bloated feeling. Crack open the gin Now, don‚Äôt get us wrong we know that alcohol is not usually the answer, but having a G&amp;T on your period can actually help alleviate pain. This is because the gin will not only relax your joints and muscles, but the juniper berries have an antiseptic effect. But stay clear of any other alcohol and keep your G&amp;T intake to a two-drink maximum otherwise it will have the opposite result. You can also try Dry Soda‚Äôs Juniper Berry soft drink, for a non-alcohol version if you prefer. Get the gang over We‚Äôre firm believers that there are few things a girl‚Äôs night can‚Äôt fix, and your period‚Äôs no different, you just have to cater it to your monthly needs. So, get your girlfriends over because chances are your cycles have synced due to an increase of the luteinizing hormone (the hormone that controls ovulation) in your shared airspace. Trade your pillows for hot water bottles as the heat will relax your abdominal muscles while sending signals to your brain to distract you from the cramps. It‚Äôs also the perfect opportunity for a DIY mask, so you don‚Äôt have to look as bad as you feel, check out our fav masks here. And of course, for your next girl‚Äôs night in, here‚Äôre our fav movies to help you feel better: Mean Girls, Clueless, Bridesmaids, How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days, Grease, She‚Äôs The Man, Bridget Jones‚Äôs Diary, Pretty Woman, Legally Blonde, Chicago‚Äì we‚Äôre totally debating spending an entire day watching these in the office with popcorn and chocolate.

Since I have moved to Dubai I notice that my skin and hair are crazy. My hair specially has lost the shiny looks like before. I have serious problem because the way my hair looks and now I really hate how its so dry and not looking healthy like before. Please right back, because I look to you and I think is great what you do. Please help Darling! OMG! If I only had a dime everyone told their hair and skin has changed when they moved to Dubai! First but foremost, the complete environment changes factors in your hair, skin and body anytime you travel! The main influences that can alter what you may be used to for hair and skin are weather, water, hormones in food, and of course any changes in diet! Anytime I travel, I pack my skin kit and hair kit according to where I am traveling to and I definitely don‚Äôt use the same things all across the world! For instance, when I am in very dry climates, like some areas on the coast in the states (for example Boston or California), I typically use skin care products that are very hydrating! One of my favorite face creams to use when I am in LA or the Bean is Shiseido Face Cream . While when I am in wetter climates, like Dubai, etc is the Kiehl‚Äôs Ultra Facial Moisturizer , since it is quite moisturizing, but still light enough to keep me from melting! Unlike your skin, which can sometimes improve when you hit more humid climates, hair can be super difficult to deal with when traveling! One of the best things to do is to keep your diet in check! It‚Äôs always great to start with healthy vitamins and foods! Some of the best foods to eat for your hair are walnuts, salmon, and flaxseeds. Keeping Omega-3 in your diet will literally transform your hair! My hair use to be soooo dull and when I started eating Salmon as well Walnuts, my hair changed sooo much! It started to shine (like from far away!) and it stopped falling out! Of course adjusting the rest of your products with your environment, can happen over time, but I love using Argan Oil (which you can find from Kiehl‚Äôs) as well as Kerastase Oleo Relax. I usually use a bit more Argan Oil in Dubai than I do in other countries to keep my hair in check! image credits allure beauty hair health Mon, 14 Mar 2011 5 Comments Related Posts The BEST Way to Wash Your Hair, Start doing this NOW!

My latest discovery is a new brand called MAKE Beauty ; they‚Äôre all about self-expression and breaking the beauty rules ‚Äì I love that! While recently shopping on Net-A-Porter, I noticed one of their products, the Sea Salt Exfoliator &amp; Marine Lip Repair kit, so I had to check it out. I was intrigued; would my lips be the softest they‚Äôve ever been? Could this be my new beauty staple? What it is: A two-step rejuvenating lip repair kit that includes a sea salt exfoliating scrub and a protective lip balm. What it does: With real sea salt crystals suspended in a soothing oil-based cream, the scrub gently buffs away dead skin and polishes away dry skin while the oil simultaneously smooths lips. The balm instantly soothes lips with natural oils, while Shea Butter adds long-lasting hydration. What we liked: I love that 10% of sales are donated to the We See Beauty Foundation that supports women-led businesses in poor communities ‚Äì I think that is so amazing. I also think the packaging is cute and simple, even if it does give me a bit of a Topshop vibe. I tried the scrub (more on that later) and followed it with the marine lip repair. The lip repair formula is unusual; it‚Äôs very gooey and stays on your lips forever and because it doesn‚Äôt move I found it very hydrating. It‚Äôs also very sticky, and although they say this can be used as a lip primer, I‚Äôm not sure that would work well under lipsticks as it is so thick. I think this would be an amazing overnight treatment so you can wake up with super soft lips, but for daytime, I‚Äôd rather wear a Liquid Matte. What we didn‚Äôt like: The results were great, but I can‚Äôt say I was a fan of the process. The scrub was strange, it kind of smells like medicine and because it‚Äôs salt, well, you know that‚Äôs not going to taste good! I can‚Äôt fault the scrubbing effect, it worked really well, and it was oily, not dry, so it‚Äôs a comfortable formula to use. However, the fact that I could taste it meant I didn‚Äôt want to leave it on my lips for very long. I wish they had used sugar because I think it would have tasted much better and scrubbed a little more. I didn‚Äôt find this lip repair kit life-changing, and I‚Äôd still go to my La Mer lip products over this. It‚Äôs not a bad product, but it‚Äôs just not a new favorite for me. I love brands that try new things, and I love the ethical background of this brand, so I definitely think it‚Äôs one to watch, and I look forward to trying their makeup collections.

In my opinion, nothing is more appealing than feeling a person‚Äôs soft silky hands. This is why I try to use a hand scrub followed by intense moisture as often as possible. Want soft hands? Check out this recipe for at home hand scrub! Silky Soft Hand Scrub Ingredients 1 cup sugar 3-4 tablespoons olive oil 2 tablespoons water 3-4 drops Essential Oil (optional) In a bowl, mix sugar, olive oil and water until solution is lump free, add essential oil. With one hand, scoop out a handful of scrub and rub on each hand in a circular motion. Rub until you feel your hands are the desired level of softness.

I neglected my hair for months before it looked fried and completely unhealthy! Luckily, I was able to bring it back to life, but it did take a lot of work!! Remember, gorgeous hair starts with taking great care! Make sure you shampoo your hair the best way for your hair type and give your hair some TLC! Here are some tips to keeping your hair healthy and avoiding damaged hair! Let Air Dry: Even if you plan on blowdrying, let your hair air dry for a few minutes before you begin. Blow drying hair that is completely wet allows for more damage and heat to be transferred to your hair! All that smoke that comes off your hair, is NOT good! No beuno!! Use Hair Protectors: Using products that protect against heat damage is key! I absolutely love Redken and Kerastase‚Äôs Heat Protecting line! It really makes a huge difference when you know your hair will have a protective layer that will help seal moisture in! Savor Your Do: Try to avoid touching your hair too much after it‚Äôs done! This way you avoid adding too many oils to your hair and you can keep it styled as long as possible! Blowdrying your hair too much, can cause severe damage as well as hair loss! Try to keep blow drys to twice per week at a maximum! image credits allure beauty blog blogger daily dose Dubai east Fashion gorgeous hair Hair Care Hair Loss hb health healthy how huda middle protect redken shine shopping tip to uae vitamin Tue, 30 Nov 2010 7 Comments Related Posts How I Get Sleek Hair Without Any Damage!

This one is definitely one of those weirder ones, but it seriously works instantly! Want a quick way to add life to your blowdry? This tip is great for anyone who is super busy and needs a day or two extra between blow dries. No starch or dry shampoo necessary! Simply grab a handful of whole oats and rub them on your scalp! Rub well with the palm of your hand, and just shake hair to remove oats. Follow by brushing out any remaining oats to avoid embarrassment! I do this in my shower, to avoid any mess, and it was very simple and gives you a bit of added volume! image credits beautybunny beauty hair Hair Care health Shampoo and Conditioner shopping Types Thu, 7 Oct 2010 5 Comments Related Posts This Amazing DIY Ingredient Is The Beyonce Of The‚Ä¶ Sat, 4 Nov 2017 Why Your Water Could Be The Reason Your Hair Is Ratchet AF Sun, 29 Oct 2017 This Ahhhhmazing Drugstore Scrub Will Smooth Your‚Ä¶ Tue, 19 Sep 2017 hissa it ‚Äòs look a usefull way , i ‚Äòll try it , thank you so much BasmaA Big hair is so sexy, the bigger the better.

To me it looks like a gimmick and I have a hard time trusting a futurisic, strange, ufo-like product; or something I would imagine like an out-of-this-world, supersonic gun in a movie. So I didn‚Äôt buy into the hype‚Ä¶ just yet. When Jen Atkin came into the office, she told me how much technology Dyson invested into this blow dryer. My thoughts were, ‚Äúokay, they spent $72 million on this product, four years of hair research and 103 engineers were working on a single hair dryer. There‚Äôs got to be something good about it.‚Äù (there should be!) So I bought it, and yes, I thought it‚Äôs expensive, but if it‚Äôs really what everyone says it is ‚Äì I consider it a good investment. Here‚Äôs what I thought. What I love about it: It is indeed a powerful hair dryer! It just blows super awesome, it sucks all the air in like a vacuum and blows it out in a straight and totally smooth way. (BTW Dyson is initially, and surprisingly, a vacuum manufacturing company so no surprise there that they have the whole air-flow game perfected!) It is absolutely fast drying as well. My usual hair drying session lasts for an hour but with this one, it can be done within 15 to 20 minutes only. I also love how easy the controls are, anybody can understand it. There are four buttons, one each to turn it on, to make it cool, for intensity and heat preference. I love that the diffusers are magnetic and they go right on easily. And then the length of the cord is 9 feet long‚Ä¶I mean how many times does it happen to you that the cord is too short to reach the mirror?! Other brands just don‚Äôt get how important that is. Overall, the way it functions is just impressive. When I tested it, my team were hooked and we actually took turns using it!! The moment you turn it on, you‚Äôll notice the big difference between the Dyson hair dryer and a classic hair dryer. What I wish they have done: The major concern for me is the heat. The brand claims it can measure the air temperature 20 times more so it can control the heat and prevent damage. But the hot is just so hot, it seems you will burn yourself when you are not careful. Also, it is agreeably lightweight (a motor in an acorn-like size and total weight of only 1.8 lbs.) and I love that, but I wish it was more lightweight and I wish there‚Äôs a smaller, travel version because this is such a powerful tool and I would love to bring it on my travels. I just wish there‚Äôs an easier click system for the cleaning filter as well. Would I recommend it: I have a bunch of blow dryers and although I love my classic blow dryers, this one has made me think I‚Äôm never gonna use any other blow dryer but this one. (until a better one comes out!) I haven‚Äôt used blow dryers for a long time simply because it takes forevaaahhhh, but since I got this, I‚Äôve been blow drying again. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who loves blow drying at home. It is fast drying, smooth, fights frizz and so easy to use. It is an advanced, futuristic, and revolutionary blow dryer. Like the blow dryer ahead of its time, or the blow dryer of 2020.

The dry winter weather likes to mess with our blow dry and give us back the frizzy hair we worked so hard to smooth out ‚Äì we‚Äôre basically Ugly Betty when winter comes. Because our hair is hygroscopic, which means it matches the moisture content of the surrounding environment, in winter our hair usually gets majorly dehydrated due to the dry air. So, when you‚Äôre in a heated room or the cold outdoors, your hair will expel moisture until it matches the climate that it‚Äôs in. Without moisture, your hair is prone to breakage, split ends, damaged hair follicles, and you can even experience hair loss ‚Äì not cool! But fortunately for our hair, we‚Äôve got six tips that will help your hair look flawless AF in no time at all. Go easy when you towel-dry Okay, we all know too much heat on our hair is bad (we‚Äôre not going there again), but it‚Äôs actually the way we dry our hair with a towel that‚Äôs doing the damage. More often than not, we twist and rub our hair dry with a towel, but this is a HUGE mistake as it‚Äôs what causes the hair follicles to break ‚Äì et voila, flyaways. Instead, you can use a soft T-shirt or a microfiber towel as they cause less friction, or just make sure you very gently ‚Äòblot‚Äô your hair with a towel, like you would with your face. Dryer Sheets are your best friend We know this sounds weird, but during the colder months, dryer sheets are THE solution to getting rid of frizzy hair and flyaways. The way they work is simple: when you glide them through your locks, the negatively charged surface of your hair bonds to the positively charged ingredients of the dryer sheet, reducing the static, leaving your hair super sleek. Get regular trims We think it‚Äôs safe to say that we‚Äôre all guilty of skipping a scheduled trim, and although you may be able to pass it off as ‚Äòbeachy waves‚Äô in the summer, it‚Äôs not as easy in the winter. Try to get a trim every six to eight weeks to side step split and brittle ends. Just be sure to ask a for a trim when you book your appointment, as tons of salons do a trim for half the price. Or, if you‚Äôre feeling brave, try out our hack for getting rid of split ends on your own: A post shared by Huda Kattan (@hudabeauty) on Aug 30, 2016 at 8:52am PDT Don‚Äôt cook your hair When our alarm goes off in the winter, the only thing that gets us out of bed is the thought of a steaming hot shower. But as hard as it may be, you need to take a shorter shower that isn‚Äôt boiling, because prolonged periods of extra hot water can damage your hair follicles and will strip your hair of essential oils that lock in moisture. Our top tip is to end your shower with a cold water rinse, as this helps to smooth your hair cuticles, which are more easily able to reflect light, therefore looking less dull. Brush with care We know it may sound a bit extra but it‚Äôs essential to use different brushes for when your hair is wet and dry. For wet hair: A plastic comb or brush is best, as this will eliminate any pulling, ripping, tugging or tearing, which will minimize breakage. For dry hair: If your hair tangles easily, avoid using a plastic comb when it‚Äôs dry, as it will only make it more static. Instead, use a metal bristled brush as this will act as a conductor of static and will give your hair a smoother finish. Nourish your hair from the inside No matter how many miracle hair products you use, if you want tresses like a Victoria‚Äôs Secret model you need to eat with your mane in mind. Look for foods that are high in antioxidants and vitamins, so stock up on your fruit and veg. Vitamin C is perfect for the winter months as it helps produce collagen, which will strengthen the capillaries of the hair shafts. Kidney beans, lentils or leafy greens like spinach are also great as they‚Äôre not only full of protein, which promotes hair growth, but also iron and zinc. Low levels of zinc and iron are the main causes of hair loss and dullness, so make sure you incorporate these into your diet ASAP.

It‚Äôs so important to factor what‚Äôs in your diet when it comes to hair as well. Externally you can only do so much. Love these tips and tricks for this season. A good tip is to also braid your hair when you go to bed to prevent tangling and your hair getting dry when you wake up, especially if it‚Äôs been processed before.

In fact, we‚Äôve been fans for a really long time! But finally, we‚Äôve come to a point when we‚Äôve realized that more than anything, long nails just get in the way of life. So we‚Äôre making the switch to shorter nails, and here‚Äôs why: 1) The stress of long nails potentially breaking is too much to handle. Not only are they fragile and more likely to break, but when they do, it‚Äôs so noticeable it feels like the worst thing in the world. 2) You‚Äôll finally be able to dress yourself again! Zips, buttons, shoe buckles, earring backs‚Ä¶ yeah, you‚Äôll be able to get ready all on your own. 3) You can text. Not only is having nails a normal length hugely practical when you‚Äôre trying to type a message quickly, but it‚Äôs a way more peaceful process without all the tapping going on. Who can relate? üòÇüòÇüòÇ A post shared by Huda Kattan (@hudabeauty) on Oct 1, 2017 at 11:30am PDT 4) You can play with makeup again. With shorter nails comes greater precision, you can finally use your finger to apply and intensify foiled eyeshadows, and you don‚Äôt need to worry about stabbing your powder formulas accidentally. 5) Just imagine all the money you can save on manicures and nail polish! Not only will you be saving a ton of money on your polish and acrylic, but the maintenance is dramatically reduced. 6) You won‚Äôt poke your eyes out trying to do the simplest things: Wearing contacts, applying false lashes, rubbing your eye‚Ä¶ Yep, all of that is no longer a hazard to your eyesight when your nails are shorter. 7) Nail art looks cuter! For some reason, tiny little nail designs just look so much better on shorter nails. 8) Shorter nails feel a little more hygienic! It‚Äôs not to say that longer nails are dirty, but if you‚Äôre a long nail fangirl, you‚Äôll know there‚Äôs no avoiding certain things embedding themselves under your nails ‚Äì although they do come in particularly helpful as a toothpick after meals, ewww! 9) Long nails are fun and all, but we kinda feel like shorter nails are a little bit cooler. 10) Basically, we‚Äôre just over super long nails‚Ä¶ even if they did make us feel like a mermaid!

I am Jessica‚Äôs make-up artist and I did her make-up in the picture. Thank you for the compliments!!!! Just a quick advise on the foundation‚Ä¶.even though water based foundation is good for oily skin I still suggest to use cream based foundation because water based is not hydrating. No matter how oily you are, the key is hydration. Cream based foundation is pretty much moisturizer with a pigment. Never use MAC foundation because it is not hypoalergenic and it is very bad for your skin. xoxo hudabeauty Hi Katarina!!! I looove your makeup!! It‚Äôs amazing!! üòâ I really love the look you did for Jessica! üôÇ Thank you soooo much for visiting hudabeauty.com and for the wonderful tip!! This is very helpful!!

I have a question for you. I‚Äôm trying to find a foundation for myself and i havent had much luck in the past. I have pretty oily skin, acne prone and i have slight redness. If thats not the worse face ever then what is. I was just wondering if you had any foundation advice and what foundation i should try (without having to spend a load of money) that would be awesome! thanks so much Leeanne Lizzy, i have similar skin and always used Chanel foundation -which is amazing but not at all friendly on your wallet. You should try the Revlon Photo Ready foundation, i love it and find for a less expensive brand the quality and coverage is great. Since i stopped using Chanel i have been trying all different brands to find the best and this one is a keeper, i shall be buying it again when it runs out!x Lizzy Thanks so much Leeanne! That really helps! i was thinking about getting Revlon colorstay for combination/oily skin. i‚Äôve done alot of research online and so hopefully i come out liking it. i always have a hard time finding the right color though, so hopefully i can figure it out. I‚Äôll be sure be giving the photo ready a try as well!

We have, and we love it! Fashion icons, Kim K, Ciara, and Rihanna have all been spotted wearing adventurous highlights in their manes and have caught our attention! Are these trendsetting divas on to something, or is this just a fad? Either way, we love it and we‚Äôre following this trend!! Great tip: Highlights are great for people who want to take focus away from traits like a slightly larger nose, etc. They are a great tool for taking attention and softening the overall appearance of the face! ‚Äì H.Kattan in beauty Rounder is Better by hudabeauty Wed, 5 May 2010 3 Comments ROUNDED NAILS | HOT TREND By Huda Heidi Kattan I knew round nails were making a come back, I just didn‚Äôt realize how hot the look was until I saw them on my friend.

She finally gave me a sample and boy did my world change! I went back the very next day for three tubes for my sisters! This stuff is amazing! It gives you extreme length, but also just the right amount of thickness. It is super black which makes for a kick ass combination! The secret weapon is the brush; it‚Äôs shaped just perfectly to give you the right volume you‚Äôre looking for. For best results, I recommend using this with a Lash Primer (Makeup Forever Lash Fibers is a good choice), and lengthening mascara (Dior Iconic and Cargo Blue-Ray Mascaras are my favorite), followed by Lash DNA. If you‚Äôre in a hurry, skip the lengthening mascara and go! ‚Äì H.Kattan in celebrity Steaming up the New Year by hudabeauty Sat, 20 Mar 2010 Leave a comment KIM KARDASHIAN | HOTTIE OF THE HOUR By Huda Heidi Kattan In only 4 years Kim Kardashian has gone from being a regular LA babe, to the request of almost everyone‚Äôs makeup artist (believe me, I know!). If you haven‚Äôt realized it yet and it‚Äôs pretty obvious, this gorgeous goddess was destined for fame. In her short time she has opened several companies, launched numerous products and is endorsing everything from makeup to salads. Let‚Äôs face it, whether you love her or love to hate her, she is hot. Just how hot? She has been regarded as one of the hottest women in Hollywood. After meeting her in LA, I realized the dazzlising dash-doll is just as sweet as she is sweetfaced. From impeccable style, to a killer bod, Kimmy K is here to stay. RESPECT!! She will be releasing two calenders next year, one as a blond and one as a brunette. Here are some sneak peaks from her 2011 calender as a brunette.

Not to mention, if your office is anything like Huda Beauty HQ, the constant supply of food is a continual test of your will-power! Don‚Äôt get us wrong, we love our curvy selves, and so should you, but we‚Äôre all for upping our fitness levels. We spoke to amazing personal trainer, fitness guru, and contributor for Men‚Äôs Health magazine, Jeremy Gwyer ( check out his IG account , you won‚Äôt regret it) to get his top, super-easy fitness tips. Even if you‚Äôre as lazy (or as busy) as many of us, we reckon you can still do at least a few of these a day. And DW, you can do these in your heels, skinny jeans, or whatever boujee outfit you‚Äôre wearing to the office: 1. Cut Back on Inter-Office emails If the person you‚Äôre emailing works in the same office or even building, get up out of your chair and deliver the message in person. Every minute of movement burns more calories than every minute seated! 2. Take the stairs Okay, maybe not every floor, but you can do the first five! Stair climbing is one of the most effective ways to tone and shape your legs. If your office is located higher than the 5th floor, every morning, lunch break, and evening, take the stairs from the ground floor to the 5th, then take the elevator the rest of the way. 3. Squeeze your booty The simple act of squeezing your muscles can help tone and strengthen them. If you can‚Äôt get out of your chair due to meetings or important calls, spend five minutes squeezing your butt, leg and abdominal muscles. For example: Squeeze the butt muscle 20 times, then the abs 20 times, then the legs 20 times. Try to repeat this at least five times during the day. 4. Walking Meetings Instead of sitting around the table of the meeting room, get moving. Discuss the business matters while burning some extra calories! If you have a big office, take a walk around it with your colleague while you ask your questions or give your weekly update. If your office is smaller, then suggest going for a juice or smoothie and get chatting on the way. 5. Drink more Water ‚Ä¶ and your metabolism increases! Staying hydrated also helps to keep feelings of hunger at bay and fills up your stomach. Replace your sweetened (or sugar-free) drinks with water, and you‚Äôll lose more weight ‚Äì period! If you‚Äôre not a fan of plain H20, add some fresh lemon or cucumber slices to give it some flavor! Aim to drink at least 2 liters of water a day ( see why you should be here ), and keep track by always having a bottle of water on your desk. Set yourself challenges ‚Äì like finishing two bottles of water bottle before lunch, or drinking a green tea every afternoon with one bottle of water before you leave work ‚Äì to make sure you‚Äôre hitting your daily target. fitness get fit health Wed, 3 Jan 2018 4 Comments Related Posts Lazy Girl Hacks: 4 Easy And Free Tips To Banish Arm‚Ä¶ Tue, 16 Jan 2018 4 Super Easy DIY Drinks To Detox And Slim, NOW!

Gucci Westman told me that Cameron Diaz loved the mascara so much, she actually requested a box full! Personally, I have been a Dior Show girl since I can remember, but recently, I have made a switch, permanently! Luckily with technology improvements, mascara has revolutionized to bring us mascaras that now make our lashes look dramatic and keep them growing long and beautiful. While you could dish out 100+ AED ($20+) to get mascara that could revive your lashes, the people at Revlon understand that quality doesn‚Äôt need to cost a fortune. Their new Grow Luscious Mascara has been my newest obsession. I seriously swear by this! It makes your lashes look beautiful, but the best part about the mascara is the affect on your lashes. My lashes have grown longer and have barely fallen out since I have starting using this mascara. I HIGHLY recommend this mascara, but try using it over a period of two weeks to notice improvements. If you have a mascara that you can‚Äôt part from, try applying it over the Grow Luscious. Start with the Grow Luscious, so that the formula will be directly on your lashes, thus you will reap all the beautiful benefits!

I bet the combination of this and latisse would be even better though! üòõ Bubu I swear by it. My lashes almost literally doubled. If Revlon ever decides to discontinue; I‚Äôm protesting! Mariam Oh how funny! I was just talking to my cousin about this mascara. She introduced me to one called 2000 Calories by Max Factor years ago, and there has been NOTHING like it. Unfortunately, they have discontinued it earlier this year. I would see these Revlon commercials ALL the time months ago‚Ä¶so I ended up buying into it..and only got to try it now (cuz i had found the few last 2000 calorie mascaras online, hehe). I believe mascaras are all about the BRUSH, and thinking that this one would work because its HUGE and resembles the Max Factor brush sort of‚Ä¶.but i‚Äôm not happy with it at all. I have really short lashes, and so i need volume and length! This product doesnt give it to me..but maybe i just need to give it 2 weeks and see what it does for me. Now, I bought this when I was in California..but now im in the UAE. Do they sell it here? IF it ends up working magic on my lashes, i might need another bottle. .. but so far, not so impressed. Do you have any suggestions for other mascaras that lengthen and thicken ? ali thank u so much for introducing this product huda!! after reading ur interview with gucci westman, i immediately went out and purchased this mascara. i am fair haired which makes my eyelashes seem nonexistent‚Ä¶ after using this mascara for a little while now i am OBSESSED. further proof that grow luscious is awesome: this wknd i was visiting with my future mother-in-law (who i haven‚Äôt seen since starting to use this product) and she asked if i was wearing false lashes!!

Tilbury has worked with some of the most famous faces like Kate Moss and Rihanna, and I‚Äôve always been such a fan of her work! I got a chance to take a look at her new Hot Lips collection, and the colors are absolutely breathtaking. Housed in the line‚Äôs signature rose gold, lipsticks are named after and inspired by some of Tilbury‚Äôs own celebrity friends. I love the unique shape of the bullets that has a slanted square tip to make it easy to apply right on the lips. Some of the office favorites are the taupey pink of Super Cindy (named after Cindy Crawford), a bold fuchsia (Electric Poppy, after Poppy Delevingne), the deep mulberry of Hel‚Äôs Bells after Helena Bonham-Carter, and a siren red (Carina‚Äôs Love, after Chinese actress Carina Lau). They run from sheer to more opaque variations and have a cream finish that helps keep lips soft. I‚Äôm having so much fun trying on the different shades. There is seriously something for everyone. Here are some swatches from the collection above ‚Äì let me know what you think! You can check them all out at charlottetilbury.com .

The pink lump of goo is actually chicken that has been separated mechanically and pushed through a machine that mashes it all together! Pretty gross huh? Well, it gets better! The mashed chicken then needs to be cleaned, since it is covered with bacteria, and is soaked in chemicals, including ammonia. After that, it is then articificially infused with chicken flavoring and then dyed white to look like ‚Äúreal‚Äù chicken. Yum! I think I may just never have chicken nuggets again!

Though hyperpigmentation is completely harmless, those dark patches ‚Äì caused by excess melanin that forms deposits of brown pigment in the skin ‚Äì can be a bitch to cover up. Fortunately, we‚Äôve got all the tips for how you can keep your pigmentation under control, hide it, and gradually reduce it. Our top pigmentation-covering products: 1: Make Up For Ever Full Cover Concealer, $34 This intensely pigmented cream formula is designed specifically for covering scars, tattoos, hyperpigmentation, and marks. A little goes a VERY long way, so even if you use this every day, it will probably last you six months. Just dab the formula onto the area you want to conceal with your fingertip, and it will set to a completely matte-finish that lasts all day. Shop it here . 2: Huda Beauty #FauxFilter Foundation, $40 For effortless coverage, our #FauxFilter foundation creates a flawless filter-like finish that will evenly and easily cover pigmentation. The formula is packed with ultra-refined pigments so that when it‚Äôs stippled onto the skin, it immediately camouflages dark areas. For extra coverage, the formula can be easily layered and then set with a powder for seamless all-day coverage. Shop it here . 3: Kevyn Aucoin The Sensual Skin Enhancer Concealer and Foundation, $48 Created by one of the most talented makeup artists of all time, you know anything from the Kevyn Aucoin brand is going to be amazing. This extra rich, creamy formula binds color-correcting shades and intense pigments with honey, Jojoba oil, and minerals for a formula that melts into your skin while providing foolproof coverage. Take a rice-sized amount on a concealer brush and gently press into the skin, blending the edges. Set with a dusting of powder. Shop it here . When blending a concealer, either use a small concealer brush and pack it on or use the pointed end of a DRY beauty blender, which will keep the coverage full. Our top tip: Use an orange or red-toned color corrector on areas of pigmentation before applying foundation or concealer ‚Äì allowing it to set first. The orange tone balances out the brown color of the pigmentation. If you have fair-to-medium skin, use a peachy shade, for medium, tan, and deep skin tones, orange works amazingly for creating the best base, and for richer skin tones, red works best to cover pigmentation. You can use liquid lipsticks on areas around your mouth, cheeks, and forehead, just be careful using them around your sensitive eye area; try shades Mamacita or Heartbreaker . A post shared by Nabela Noor (@nabela) on Nov 15, 2017 at 11:24am PST Our FAV DIYs for lightening pigmentation and dark spots: Raw Potato: Potato contains an enzyme called catecholase, which helps to lighten skin. Cut a potato into thick slices, then add a drop of water (or lemon juice) to the surface and rub it onto the area of pigmentation for around five or ten minutes. Do this morning and evening, and you should start to see results after a month. Apple Cider Vinegar: ACV is one of our all-time fav natural ingredients (see why it‚Äôs so awesome here ), and it has natural AHAs that penetrate deep into the skin and can help lighten skin tone. Dampen a cotton pad with water and add ACV, and wipe it over the affected area every morning and night. Red light therapy and retinol are also amazing for improving the appearance of pigmentation, and you will see much swifter results, get all the details about retinol here . This Alpha Arbutin 2% + HA formula ($13) from The Ordinary is specifically designed to target pigmentation. Finally, make sure you always wear an SPF, as this will prevent your hyperpigmentation from darkening further. concealers for pigmentation Hyperpigmentation pigmentation Fri, 24 Nov 2017 3 Comments Related Posts Concealer 101: How To Hide Dark Circles And Pimples!

So obviously, I was dying to get my hands, and lips, on the latest Kylie Cosmetics collaboration with her big sister Kim. The KKW Cr√®me Liquid Lipstick collection includes four super pretty pinky nude shades, AND they‚Äôre in a completely new formula ‚Äì not a gloss or a matte! This new formula reeeeally intrigued me and I was very excited to finally try these out! Appropriately named with Kim‚Äôs nicknames ‚Äì Kimberly, Kim, Kiki, and Kimmie ‚Äì the whole vibe of the collection is cute and girly, just like the brand. What it is: Four nude colored creamy liquid lipsticks offering sheer to medium coverage, which can be layered to build intensity. What it does: The formula contains ingredients to moisturize and hydrate your lips, while the gloss-like texture glides onto lips for a lightweight feeling. What we liked: I looove the packaging, and the colors are SOOO stunning! They feel super comfortable, and have a really nice texture to them. However, when I removed the product, my lips didn‚Äôt feel particularly hydrated. They lasted long enough as well, and with a couple of layers, the finish was a beautiful, soft sheen. My favorite has to be Kimberly; it‚Äôs such a subtle and wearable nude. What we didn‚Äôt like: Although the cr√®me is comfortable, the pay off is quite sheer, and I prefer my lipsticks to have more coverage. I tried mixing it with a liquid matte, but the combination seemed too intense, and the lightest color, Kimberly, turned out really light and chalky. If you guys get this collection and want a more opaque finish, use a liquid lipstick and then apply a very small amount of lip cr√®me at the center and blend out. I can‚Äôt help it, I‚Äôm a matte liquid lipstick lover! I kind of wish these were in a liquid matte formula, but the colors are really really pretty so I‚Äôll definitely enjoy wearing these shades.

The bottles are insanely gorgeous and I‚Äôm inlove with the Pivoine Suzhoe fragrance because it contains these stunning silky pearl flakes which slightly shimmer wherever you spray the it. The flakes are incredibly fine, and unlike most products which contain shimmer, the pigment does not transfer. The fragrance is inspired by a legendary garden in Suzhoe, an ancient Chinese city, and is also a celebration of China‚Äôs most beloved flower ‚Äì the peony. It is a floral fragrance without being overly sweet or floral‚Ä¶if that makes sense. It‚Äôs something I‚Äôd wear during the day and at night because although it‚Äôs an extremely elegant fragrance, it‚Äôs very sensual at the same time. Incase you missed my Snapchat on the day, check it out below. You‚Äôll also see some of the shimmers after I sprayed the fragrance. üôÇ armani prive perfume Wed, 7 Dec 2016 Leave a comment Related Posts This Body Oil is a Beach Vacation in a Bottle Thu, 20 Oct 2016 What‚Äôs On Huda‚Äôs Desk This Week Mon, 5 Sep 2016 10 Cult Lipsticks You Have To Try Wed, 19 Jul 2017</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>The Gorgeous Armani/Priv√© Fragrances for UAE National Day!</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>2016-12-07 00:00:00</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>3ce7-4506-aac4</string></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>7c881dd9a7b8cc2e76ccde48626cb00fe719a9d6</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_template</name><value><string>3ce7-4506-aac4</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>in celebrity HOT!!!

Suratt Beauty Relev√©e Lash Curler ‚Äì There‚Äôs something really cool about the matte black. Suratt Beauty is a brand I really love, and this eyelash curler works particularly well on almond-shaped eyes. Forever Roses black rose ‚Äì I‚Äôm definitely going through a black phase. There‚Äôs something very heavy and rich about it. I have a few of these at the office. Diptyque Roses candle ‚Äì All of Diptyques candles smell so soft and pretty. It‚Äôs not overpowering and I‚Äôm obsessed with the Roses scent. I‚Äôve lived in the States for a long time, and in Dubai for a long time and this floral fragrance I feel works in both areas. It transcends and works wherever you are. M2 Beaut√© Eyelash Activating Serum ‚Äì Funny enough, Revitalash isn‚Äôt working as well on me like it used to! This brought my lashes back to life. The only thing is the serum is kind of strong, so you might feel a burning sensation when you use it, which I found a little uncomfortable around my eyes. But it does work in making my lashes super thick. I bought this at Harrod‚Äôs during my last trip in London, and liked it so much, I bought three more. Chanel Gard√©nia perfume ‚Äì I love Chanel‚Äôs Gard√©nia particularly because it can stand on its own but is still so light that can also mix well with other fragrances. I have one at home and one on my desk. I bought two by accident. Well, not really by accident‚Ä¶kind of by accident. favorite products Huda's picks Mon, 5 Sep 2016 12 Comments Related Posts Beginner‚Äôs Guide: How To Choose The Right‚Ä¶ Fri, 17 Nov 2017 The Products These Top 5 New York Beauty Editors Swear By Tue, 26 Sep 2017 The Top 5 Eyebrow Growth Serums And My Miracle DIY Mix Tue, 4 Jul 2017 Wedding dresses This is my first time i visit here.

The other day, I ran into a friend of mine, I hadn‚Äôt seen in months! Being such a gorgeous girl, you would never really notice her pigmentation or dark circles, but when I saw her, I noticed something different, in a great way! She looked healthy, well rested and just amazing overall! I asked her right away why she looked SO gorgeous! She told me everyone had been commenting on her skin and that she completely saw a difference after using the Neutrogena Healthy Skin Anti-Wrinkle Cream . After she said it to me, I saw immediately that her her pigmentation and dark circles were almost gone! I was really impressed, especially since I saw her sans makeup! I did a bit of research, the reviews were amazing! I recently bought this product and I can‚Äôt wait to use it! This product does contain retinol, which may result in brighter, more radiant skin, and can also help diminish any scars from blemishes or discoloration.

I know how it feels‚ÄìI used to get some terrible breakouts and I never wanted to leave the house! Recently on a shoot, one of the stylist, who was absolutely gorgeous, told me she had noticed a sudden appearance of hyperpigmentation on her face. This is very common and happens as a result of sun exposure, age, diet as well as pregnancy and hormonal imbalances. While it‚Äôs always a great idea to find the root of the problem, there are products out there to help boot spots and reveal radiant skin! Now, I haven‚Äôt personally tried this product, but I have had literally, nearly a dozen girls email me about how much they loved this product! Since I hadn‚Äôt tried it I was a bit weary, after all I am your guinea pig! After doing a bit of research I found that it has won best of beauty awards for 2010 from Allure Magazine as well as Marie Claire . After reading consumer reviews, this product seems to do what it says! It helps with any type of skin imperfections including hyperpigmentation, sun spots, aging spots, as well as acne scars! Most reviewers actually said, it helped make them look young again! All that from a little jar?! Pretty impressive! I recommend contacting your dermatologist as well as your gynecologist to find the root cause of any spots or rough patches on your skin. It‚Äôs important to stop more from forming if possible and then treat accordingly! image credits stylist beauty brown complexion discolor get health Hyperpigmentation Marie Claire perfect rid skin Skin Care spots sun Sunspot Sun, 21 Nov 2010 13 Comments Related Posts Why Not Understanding Your Skin Type Is Keeping You‚Ä¶ Wed, 29 Nov 2017 Why You‚Äôre Getting Booty Spots And How To Get Rid Of Them Sat, 23 Dec 2017 Staying Flawless During Pregnancy: How To Avoid‚Ä¶ Sun, 15 Oct 2017 Maathu Hi Huda , thank you so much for your tomato treatment.

Hassani (@EnnHassani) your tomato mask works wonder! just so you know, mixing oats and a little drizzle of honey into the tomato mask works wonders! the oats can moisturize and brighten up your complection + the honey helps the acid in the tomato (AHA acids) soak into your skin faster and help renewal of cells quicken up (if you have any acne scars or dark spots) you should give it a try twice a week, won‚Äôt regret it! meryem Hi, Huda, i llove your beauty log, my english is not good, iam french, just ia want to say that clinique even better clinical is not a good antiaging, you can read futurederm.com, she have a review , Mais to be honest, i‚Äôm not a huge fan of Clinique products in general..they didn‚Äôt work well for me! (but maybe it‚Äôs just me) i would like to share this with you, i‚Äôve been using: Vichy Normaderm Anti-Imperfection Hydrating Care Oil Free Lotion for like a month now and i‚Äôm loving the results..i found that the texture of my skin was alot smoother and my face would stay matte for longer throughout the day, i noticed a fading of the blemishes on my face and it helped even out my skin tone. It‚Äôs perfect to use underneath foundation as a makeup base http://international.drugstore.com/popups/largerphoto/default.asp?pid=255683&amp;catid=98737&amp;size=300&amp;trx=29888&amp;trxp1=255683&amp;trxp2=1 Renren i have acne scars‚Ä¶.their not severe, but not pretty either. Does it give visible good results? and how long did it take to show the difference? i NEED something for my face Mais i have few scars as well, it didn‚Äôt help a lot with those, or maybe it needs more time i dunno! but my whole skin looks so much better, the acne spots; either the brownish or redish ones completely disappeared i stared seeing the difference from the first week, which made me like it even more Renren oooh, i just commented on the FB link. Anyways, i don‚Äôt recommend it either. Like i said, i got weird tiny little white spots‚Ä¶.they weren‚Äôt alot or that visible but i noticed their appearance after i used it. Like i said, the lady at the clinique counter claimed the formula has been changed and is medicated (if i remember correctly) but the one i have has currently one job‚Ä¶.and that‚Äôs being a shelf decor üôÇ Angela I used this product as directed, it actually broke me out more, hince leaving even MORE acne scaring. Don‚Äôt believe the hype. Amna Hi Huda, this sounds great! do you recommend anything for minimizing the appearance of pores on the face? thanks! great blog! üôÇ Renren if it‚Äôs ok, i‚Äôd like to recommend two products: Philosophy‚Äôs Purity face cleanser‚Ä¶.actually lessens the appearance of pores after washing. Estee Lauder Idealist is recommended as well. Although, I‚Äùm using it regularly now for a couple of days now so I‚Äôll let you know more soon. Read online reviews of people who‚Äôve used it to give you an overall idea about the product‚Ä¶.it‚Äôs what i do before i splurge on anything. aida estee lauder idealist is the best for minimizing the appearance of pores ! üòâ Mai I‚Äôve used a whole bottle of this religously (morning and night) and it did nothing for my acne scars..

With access to the hottest products on the planet, an insight into the latest must-have ingredients, and tricks up their sleeves from years of beauty editing, who better to reveal their all-time favorite products than New York‚Äôs most distinguished beauty editors! So, we asked these five beauty connoisseurs to narrow down their trusted favorites and share their top three ride-or-die products with us‚Ä¶ Jenna Rennert, Associate Beauty Editor, Vogue Shu Uemura Eyelash Curler: When I was 14, my high school sent every student on a mandatory outward bound program in the Everglades for a week. Most kids brought protein bars or mini battery-powered fans as their desert island item. I bought an eyelash curler ‚Äì still can‚Äôt live without one to this day. The Drybar Detox: No one should ever leave the house without a mini can of dry shampoo. Drybar‚Äôs formula is like a reset button for your hair ‚Äì instant blowout refresh. Bonus points if you spray pre-workout; it always helps my hair feel cleaner post sweat! Tom Ford Tobacco Vanilla: My signature scent, there‚Äôs absolutely nothing out there like it. I always spritz my clothes with 1-2 pumps before getting dressed ‚Äì really subtle and not overpowering at all. Follow Jenna on Instagram . Shop Jenna‚Äôs beauty favs: the curler , the dry shampoo , the perfume . Kahlana Barfield Brown, Editor at Large, InStyle Nars Matte Velvet Lip Pencil In Dragon Girl : I wear this red lipstick almost every day ‚Äì literally! It‚Äôs the perfect red for dark skin. It‚Äôs blue-based and completely matte without being drying. I layer it on nice and strong, so it really pops. Eve Lom Face Cleanser: I‚Äôve been using this cleanser consistently for the past two years, and I love it. It‚Äôs a balm that you apply to dry skin, massage across your face, then rinse with a damp cloth. It gets rid of all traces of makeup and leaves your skin feeling super moisturized. Lancome Grandiose Mascara: I have wildly curly lashes and this mascara keeps them tame. The bristles really get in there and stretch my lashes from root to tips for major length and lift. Follow Kahlana on Instagram . Shop Kahlana‚Äôs beauty favs: the lip pencil , the cleanser , the mascara . Jessica Chia, Senior Beauty Editor, Allure Dr. Fill in Women‚Äôs Edge and Fill Powder: This dark powder was originally created to fill in guys‚Äô beards and bald spots, but it doubles as the best brow product. I use it with an angled liner brush to create long, arched brows every day (mine are naturally short and stubby), and on special occasions. On nights out when I know there‚Äôll be flash photography, I use it on the front of my parting so that it looks a bit tighter and fuller (this is something celebs do so you never see obvious scalp). Wherever I apply it, it goes on smoothly and absolutely never budges. Harklinikken Hair Extract: This might not sound sexy ‚Äì but after experiencing unexplained hair thinning last year, this botanical serum is the only thing that fixed my widening part and bald patches at my temples. I‚Äôve been using it for a year now, and I‚Äôm happy to report that not only has my hair returned, but it‚Äôs also thicker and longer than it‚Äôs ever been. Eminence Organic Facial Recovery Oil: I have breakout-prone skin, but using this clarifying facial oil every morning keeps my skin super-glowy and keeps my pores clear. It‚Äôs really strengthened my skin barrier, so it‚Äôs less sensitive overall, and I always get compliments on how healthy my skin looks. Plus, it doesn‚Äôt contain any gross chemical ingredients! Follow Jessica on Instagram . Shop Jessica‚Äôs beauty favs: the powder , the serum , the face oil . Bee Shapiro, Writer for The New York Times, Vanity Fair, Glamour Ellis Brooklyn Sci Fi Eau de Parfum: I‚Äôve never been a vanilla fan, but when I worked with perfumer Jerome Epinette on this beauty for my fragrance line, he really blew me away. He took vanilla to another otherworldly level ‚Äì it‚Äôs blended with green tea and bitter orange for a unique take that has the sweetness, but finishes clean and modern. Omorovicza Mineral UV Shield: I only do mineral sunscreens ‚Äì why put more chemicals on your skin than necessary when there are terrific mineral options out there now? This one, hands down, is the best one I‚Äôve ever tried. It‚Äôs weightless, melds into skin nicely, and there‚Äôs this lovely matte finish that‚Äôs almost like a blur primer. Diorshow Brow Styler Ultra-Fine Precision Brow Pencil: There are so many brow products out now, but I just keep going back to this wonder pencil. The formula is the perfect amount of waxiness, so it doesn‚Äôt slip, and the color (I use universal dark brown) is on point ‚Äì not too dark as brunette colors can be. Follow Bee on Instagram . Shop Bee‚Äôs beauty favs: the perfume , the sunscreen , the brow pencil . Jennifer Goldstein, Executive Beauty Editor, Marie Claire, and Co-Host of Fat Mascara Blinc Mascara in Black: I co-host a podcast called Fat Mascara, so you know I try every mascara out there. The thing is, they all smudge or run on me. (I think it‚Äôs a combo of having long lashes and oily lids ‚Äì who knows?) The only one that stays put is Blinc, a ‚Äòtubing‚Äô mascara that wraps your lashes in little black tubes that don‚Äôt budge until you wet your lashes and gently press on them to slide them off. If you‚Äôre after major volume or a spiky editorial look, this mascara won‚Äôt do it; but if you want to define, darken, and separate and never worry about raccoon eyes, this is the bomb. Skin Medica TNS Essential Serum: I have no problem with the word antiaging because I. Don‚Äôt. Want. To. Look. Old. There, I said it. In an attempt to stave off all the signs of aging, I use this morning and night. The key ingredient, in my opinion, is the epidermal growth factors, which do everything retinol does‚Äîand then some‚Äîbut without any of the irritation. Use it for 30 days so you can really see the effects: lines are softened, skin tone is evened, and you just have this plumper more radiant look. Blum Naturals Daily Dry/Sensitive Skin Towelettes: When trying products all day long is part of your job, you need a workhorse makeup wipe, and these are mine. They remove most color cosmetics quickly and easily, but the major reason I love them is that they don‚Äôt make my skin or eyes sting. Like, at all. I first tried them when a stranger offered me one after an AKT fitness class ‚Äì I must have looked like a hot mess ‚Äì and now I buy them in bulk from Amazon every few months.

It seems that no matter how reliable a product claims to be, when you get to the three-month mark the miracle that once took hold of your skin is slowly vanishing. At this point, we decide the product isn‚Äôt as good as we previously believed and instantly regret telling all our girlfriends, colleagues, and anyone who will listen, that this new product is THE bomb. There‚Äôs such a thing as a 3-month ‚Äòick‚Äô ‚Äì and it doesn‚Äôt just relate to the people you‚Äôre dating ‚Äì it basically means that after your new moisturizer starts to change your life, it will eventually plateau. When you start to see improvements, your faith in the product increases. By week 12 you‚Äôre expecting to be even more impressed, but this is actually the stage when the effects of your favorite cream will begin to diminish as your skin builds up a resistance to the ingredient. Now before you get upset, this won‚Äôt be the case with every single product you love ‚Äì thank god! This is mainly regarding products you‚Äôre using that include super active ingredients, like retinol. The fact is you need to switch up your skincare routine regularly ‚Äì like interval training for your skin. Now, as the seasons are changing, it‚Äôs the perfect time to reevaluate your skincare routine and see what you need to change with the cooler weather. It‚Äôs actually easy: if you‚Äôre using a retinol cream (find out why you probably should be here ), every few months swap it with another of your fav ingredients, maybe an AHA or a hydrating serum. Try two sets of products that have different primary active ingredients, which you can alternate every few months, that way your skin will get the most out of each ingredient, and you‚Äôll get that dewy glow all year round. You don‚Äôt need to throw away your products, just rotate them! Here‚Äôre a few other tips to make sure your products are packing as much punch as they were at week six: Keep your eyes creams in the fridge. Keeping them in a chilled environment will immediately reduce puffiness and dark circles when you use them. Some celebrities, including Beyonc√©, have been known to use their eye creams all over their face. As it‚Äôs made for the most sensitive skin, it‚Äôs packed with potent nourishing and hydrating qualities. No wonder she wakes up that flawless! This may sound simple, but this easy step can make a big difference: make sure you wash your face with warm water before you apply your creams. When you raise the temperature of the skin, it creates space in-between your pores allowing for better absorption. retinol skin tricks Skincare Fri, 3 Nov 2017 8 Comments Related Posts How Your Moisturizing Mistakes Are Messing Up Your Skin Thu, 28 Dec 2017 Where You‚Äôre Going Wrong With Your Moisturizer And‚Ä¶ Tue, 10 Oct 2017 If You Want To Look Like These Celebs At 50, This Is‚Ä¶ Wed, 4 Oct 2017 Sam I have been suffering from acne and have had it for years but now I get it them often but not as much around my face.

HB Team Hi my love, you should check out our tips from skincare expert Dr. Doris Day (here), but using a salicylic cleanser should help. Moisturizer is also really important, as is your entire skincare regime. Check out our guides for finding the right cleanser , toner , and moisturizer . Another thing to remember is your diet! If you have a lot of dairy and sugar, this could also be something that is causing breakouts. Hope this helps. xxx Maddy Try and stop using products with salicylic acid in them.. i had terrible acne because of the salicylic acid in the face washes I used to use and as soon as I quit and used the dove beauty bar soap I saw results immediately, also glam glow super mud and flash mud use super mud once a week and flash mud twice it really does the trick!! mily jain I follow different skin care routines in different seasons as my skin changes.

Am i going wrong somewhere here..? HB Team Hi my love, it really depends on your skin type. A salicylic cleanser is great for acne-prone skin. If your skin is warm, it will be better able to absorb moisturizer, but the cold ice wash will close your pores, so that‚Äôs great to do before makeup application. Check out our moisturizer , cleanser , and toner guides , this should give you lots of info on the right products to use for your skin type. Xx Nikita I‚Äôll be definitely trying this out! Thanks so much!</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>Why Your Faithful Skincare Regime Is Failing To Come Through</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>2017-11-03 00:00:00</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>3ce7-4506-aac4</string></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>e031bf983f7618f297c35c1ade0c1868d92b9545</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>Sunspot</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>https://hudabeauty.com/tag/sunspot/</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>in product review , skin For that Flawless Complexion! by hudabeauty Sun, 21 Nov 2010 13 Comments PRODUCT ALERT | SKIN By Huda Heidi Kattan I can‚Äôt even begin to explain how much it kills me when someone tells me they are unhappy with their skin!

People have literally spent thousands of dollars to get clear, glowing skin. While some are doing everything right, others may be causing damage to one of the most important parts of their face (and body). Here are 5 extremely bad skin habits to break from Totalbeauty.com. Bad Skin Habit #1: Smoking If health isn‚Äôt a good enough reason to stop smoking, what about your looks? Along with sunbathing, smoking is one of the worst things you can do to your skin. It decreases the rate at which your cells get oxygen, which cause you to wrinkle, significantly. Bad Skin Habit #2: Going Unprotected You may not realize this, but years of unprotected exposure to the sun will eventually catch up to you one day. Sun damage builds up over time and can be completely irreversible and deadly. Make sure you wear a good sunscreen to protect against any of the damage and premature aging that is unavoidable without protection! Bad Skin Habit #3: Sleeping with Your Makeup Night time is a great time for your skin to renew itself, which is why skin needs to breath at night. Wearing makeup while you sleep hinders the ability of collagen reproduction, which increases the chances of wrinkles, scarring, etc. Washing your face before bedtime is also crucial to wash off any bacteria and dirt that may be clogging your pores! Bad Skin Habit #4: Stressing Cortisol is the famous hormone that is released when we stress ! When this happens, the chances of breakouts increase significantly and may cause your skin to become dull. Meditating , even for a few minutes a day, can help your skin improve dramatically! Bad Skin Habit #5: Long Nights When you skin sleep, your skin muscles start to relax and cause your skin to look saggy. If that‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt scare you, the dark circles and puffiness that comes with lack of sleep will! Getting 8 hours of sleep is crucial for gorgeous skin! image credits ayushveda Anti-Aging beauty damage Eye circles health premature aging scar skin Skin Care sun Sun tanning Wrinkle (skin) Mon, 30 Aug 2010 1 Comment Related Posts These 5 Things Will Make Your Skin Look‚Ä¶ Sat, 28 Oct 2017 This Is The RIGHT Way To Cleanse For Model Skin Sun, 24 Dec 2017 Why Not Understanding Your Skin Type Is Keeping You‚Ä¶ Wed, 29 Nov 2017 Pur Essence Review Hey there!

I follow it every day and I feel I can relate with you. Even sometimes my friends and I try to make our look like yours, we really love you. Your to kind to share all your tips with us. Huda I have a problem with acne. I have some spots on my buttom, but want them to go badly. I am so sorry to share this with you, but it‚Äôs really bothering me. Do you have any tips for this? Pls help! Hi darling! First of all, Thank you soooo much for your sweet words! I am so touched! I love you guys so much! üôÇ Second, don‚Äôt be sorry! We all have imperfections that are sometimes embarrassing and it‚Äôs important to find out how to banish those flaws as effectively as possible! You came to the right place! Body acne is a pain! It‚Äôs just no fun! Breakouts on our face really stink, but getting them on our body typically means they don‚Äôt get as much attention and sometimes increase or scar if not treated properly. The best way to deal with backne or acne on your derriere is to use the right kind of body wash. I use to get blemishes on my body from time to time, but I now use Peter Thomas Roth Blemish Buffing Body Wash , which has seriously cleared my skin. I use it every single day after I finish washing my body, I then again wash my back, chest and you guessed it, with this awesome body wash and it keeps my super smooth! If the acne persist, try rubbing a little toner on the area as well, I love the Clinique Toner (after writing about this toner, I was literally flooded with responses saying this toner helped many girls cure acne they had had for years). I really hope this helps darling!! Keep me posted!!

Dolly Thanks for the tips girls! SHARAREH Hello Dear, Body acne is very common and nothing to be ashamed of. Back acne and acne that appears on your bottom (butt) are completely different types of acne with different reasons. If you have acne on your bottom (butt) it usually appears in bigger bumps and are a bit painful. It could happen for many reasons and common ways to avoid or to get ride of are: make sure the toilet seat is always clean perhaps clean it before sitting on it. Make sure you cleans yourself with warm water not hot or cold. You can make a homemade scrub out of salt (use sea salt with medium size crystals) and fresh squeezed lemon juice and genteelly scrub the area. Keep the area dry at all times, use the summers eve feminine powder use a generous amount to cover the area and keep it dry for longer ( DO NOT USE BABY POWDER, it has powder form oil that could cause more acne. when you have the ‚Äúmonthly problem‚Äù keep the area clean at all times and only wear 100% cotton panties (i know it sounds grandmaish) avoid lace or other materials that could irritate your skin.Do not wax the area and after the acne clears up if you face scaring issues use a high vitamin C lotion or serum. Button acne in not a hormonal problem so if you follow good steps of taking care of it, you would see clear skin very soon. Hope this would help :o) Kelly LOVE YOUR BLOG!!!

However, most days I am able to completely fake looking bright and awake! And after getting several request on how I do this, I had to share! These are my super easy ways to faking a good night‚Äôs sleep! Conceal Me! Adding a concealer that is two to three shades lighter than your skin tone to the area under and around your eyes instantly brightens the area and makes you look awake! I usually opt for a tone that is warm since it also adds youth! Blushing Beauty! Nothing says health the way a natural flush does! Add a blusher that is natural in tones, like Bobbi Brown‚Äôs Apricot blush or MAC‚Äôs Pinch Me. Both of these are extremely natural in tone and add a pinch of color! Curl Those Bad Boys! Whenever I don‚Äôt apply mascara, I always get asked if I‚Äôm sick or tired! Ok, lashes are gorgeous, I wear them like the best of them, but on those days when I‚Äôm in a rush, I simply add some of my favorite mascara, I love Revlon‚Äôs Grow Luscious Mascara , and let them dry before I curl them ! You look instantly awake!

Contrary to popular belief, brows do not frame the face, they really have far more importance than that‚Äìthey balance your face, which is so much more important! If you have eyebrows that are perfectly shaped and don‚Äôt need any filling, then bravo! You are truly blessed. But if you are like the rest of us normal good-brow-loving-enthusiast and want the perfect brows, then you may need to fill in a hair or two. Watch out, filling eyebrows in incorrectly can cause an effect that will not be favorable, even if Frida is your first name! Luckily, this brow pencil from MAC is the cure-all. It creates great depth, but brushed with a spooley and the lines fade into a natural looking brow! It‚Äôs so good that I keep this in my kit, at home in my personal kit and in my purse. With this amazing pencil, there truly is no reason why anyone can‚Äôt have great brows! My favorite color is spiked (not pictured).

I‚Äôve tried unicorn brushes, unicorn makeup, and I even threw a unicorn party for my daughter, of course I wanted to try a scrub that would turn me into a mythical creature. The Frank Body Shimmer Scrub is packaged to perfection ‚Äì if you put glitter or iridescent shimmer on anything I‚Äôm more than likely going to want to buy it and try it. The thing is, I‚Äôve received so many coffee scrubs in the same zip-lock packaging, but none of them called to me to try them (they weren‚Äôt covered in shimmer). I could never be bothered to open them up and figure out how I was going to keep my scrub fresh when it came in a packet. With a 50,000-person waiting list on its launch, the Frank Body Shimmer Scrub was a must-try, especially as it promises to turn my weekdays into weekends! What it is: A sugary, salty scrub with vitamin E, grapeseed oil (rich in antioxidants), salt, sugar, roasted ground coffee beans, and mica (a pearlescent mineral) to make your skin glow. It‚Äôs also vegan, nut-free and palm-oil-free. What it does: It exfoliates and smooths your skin to leave you with gorgeously shimmering, soft, and hydrated skin. It also promises to put ‚Äòa little disco in your day.‚Äô What we liked: I‚Äôm not a big coffee drinker, and I‚Äôm not crazy about the smell of coffee, but OMG this smells absolutely divine ‚Äì it‚Äôs like a delicious macchiato that I want to drink all day. As soon as I took my first handful of scrub I loved it, the texture was really fine, finer than sugar, so it wasn‚Äôt gritty or scratchy on your skin. It has a slight oil base, but only enough to bind the product, so it‚Äôs not dripping in oil like most scrubs, which can leave a greasy residue on your skin that can feel a little icky. This combo of a very light oil and a fine scrub was ahhhhmazing, I used it neck-to-toe and it left my skin feeling unbelievably soft, like every bit of dead skin was completely gone. I noticed it evened out my skin tone and I even felt like it improved the appearance of wrinkles on my d√©colletage (sunbathing faux pas!), if that‚Äôs possible! The coffee definitely has an invigorating effect, and it smelt so fricking good I really didn‚Äôt want the experience to end. What we didn‚Äôt like: I love the packaging, but I‚Äôm not crazy about the packet; it opens easily, and it has a zip lock, so it‚Äôs easy to reseal but because there isn‚Äôt a flat bottom you still have to try and prop it up between bottles so that it won‚Äôt fall in the shower. As far as the shimmer is concerned I didn‚Äôt really notice much of a mythical glow after I used it, which is fine, I don‚Äôt want to look like I‚Äôve just come back from Coachella. But because it‚Äôs called a shimmer scrub, I kind of expected it to have big chunks of glitter in the formula, just for fun when you‚Äôre using it. So, although the mica makes the formula shimmery, it doesn‚Äôt quite transform you into a glowing goddess like it claims it will. I have to admit, I felt kind of addicted to Frank Body scrubs after I used it and I immediately wanted to go out and buy them all. The product packs 7 ounces, so you could easily get 15 to 20 uses out of it, depending on how much you use. I REALLY love how this made my skin feel, it was just super beautifying and deep-cleansing, and the smell more than makes up for any lack of glitter.

It‚Äôs hard enough to keep pores looking minimal as it is, with dirt from the environment, face creams that are too thick, and simply other elements that are unavoidable! Good upkeep is key to keep your skin looking flawless and give you that porcelain appearance! A great way to keep pores clear is with steam! You can do this as often as daily or weekly depending on your skin! I recommend doing this before you sleep or a day where you can give yourself a break from makeup! Boil a large pot of water on the stove. Use a medium size towel and place over your head while you lean over the pot. Make sure water is no longer boiling at this point, you don‚Äôt want water spewing out of the pot, you only need the steam! Lean over the pot for 10-15 minutes than wash your face as usual, followed by toner to extract any dirt out of your face! Make sure you rinse your face with cold water before applying lotion! image credits becomegorgeous at beauty blog care cosmetics create Dubai easy for hb health heidi home how huda hudabeauty kattan large moisturizer natural pore shopping skin Skin Care small spa steam tips to vitamin Wine tasting descriptors Sun, 21 Nov 2010 4 Comments Related Posts The Best Thing For Your Skin Is Completely Free Tue, 25 Jul 2017 This Is The RIGHT Way To Cleanse For Model Skin Sun, 24 Dec 2017 How Your Cleanser Could Be Ruining Your Skin, And‚Ä¶ Sun, 27 Aug 2017 ELISA AWESOME!

I don‚Äôt know about you, but when I wear certain shoes, in my case designer shoes, I always get blisters. I HATE THAT! So to keep my feet blister-free, I simply have my own deodorant for my feet. That‚Äôs right, I use the same brand of my underarm deodorant on my feet (just a separate tube). Deodorant closes the sweat glands that cause blisters to form when you wear tight shoes. This is super quick and easy and if you are someone who appreciate pretty feet, this will help tremendously!

After all, working out should be making us more healthy and beautiful, right? Well, if you are prone to acne, follow these quick and easy tips on how to keep your clean squicky clean of any blemishes before and after your workout. Tips on staying clear post workout: Make sure your skin is clean before you workout. Yes, this may seem pretty self-explanatory, but if you have oils already on your skin, then this will increase the likelihood of breakouts when you sweat. If you don‚Äôt have time to bathe before hand, try just rubbing down the areas that you are prone to breakouts with mild toner, like witch hazel. If you are very much prone to acne, then try using a cream that has salicylic acid or zinc before you work out. Make sure you wear clothing that does dry very quickly so that when you do sweat, it will not hold to your skin. Try to bathe immediately after your workout if possible. If you don‚Äôt have the time, then try to dab any area that may be sweaty with a soft tissue (toilet paper is usually the best option). image courtesy of fortfitness beautiful beauty clear easy exercise out post quick skin tips work workout zits Sat, 22 May 2010 4 Comments Related Posts Why You‚Äôre Getting Booty Spots And How To Get Rid Of Them Sat, 23 Dec 2017 If You Have Body Acne, You Need To Try This!

If you‚Äôve ever been injured you probably know that putting vitamin E on the effected area will aid healing, that‚Äôs because Vitamin E is great for restoring damaged skin cells.

She finally gave me a sample and boy did my world change! I went back the very next day for three tubes for my sisters! This stuff is amazing! It gives you extreme length, but also just the right amount of thickness. It is super black which makes for a kick ass combination! The secret weapon is the brush; it‚Äôs shaped just perfectly to give you the right volume you‚Äôre looking for. For best results, I recommend using this with a Lash Primer (Makeup Forever Lash Fibers is a good choice), and lengthening mascara (Dior Iconic and Cargo Blue-Ray Mascaras are my favorite), followed by Lash DNA. If you‚Äôre in a hurry, skip the lengthening mascara and go! ‚Äì H.Kattan</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>e96144f5e2a845ba95e1a51a2731e35c52dccab8</string></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>3ce7-4506-aac4</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>work</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>https://hudabeauty.com/tag/work/</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>in product review Goodbye Cellulite! by hudabeauty Sun, 14 Nov 2010 9 Comments PRODUCT ALERT | CELLULITE By Huda Heidi Kattan It seems that every woman, no matter how genetically blessed has at least one dimple some where, if not a few hundred!

But when it comes to cleansers, we‚Äôre much less discerning; we‚Äôll choose one based on brand, packaging, or an ad we saw. Getting clued up on your cleansers is actually so important, because knowing which type of cleanser to use can have a huge impact on your skin ‚Äì seriously, HUGE! We all know how long we spend decoding our moisturizers, well, the process should be the same for your cleanser. To make it extra easy for you, here‚Äôs our ultimate cleanser breakdown, so you can choose the best one specifically for your skin type: Gel Cleansers BEST FOR: COMBINATION/ OILY/ ACNE-PRONE SKIN Gel formulas are clear with a thick gel consistency, and they‚Äôre amazing for deep cleansing. They decongest clogged pores, remove excess oils without stripping the skin, and many formulas also have antibacterial ingredients that are perfect for calming acne-prone skin. Gels are ideal for deep cleaning without over-stripping. You can even use some gel cleansers as a mask, just leave them on your skin for a couple of minutes and wash off. Beware of: Strong ingredients that can overly strip your skin. If your face feels tight after using a gel cleanser, it could be too intense for your skin. Best ingredients: Alpha Hydroxy Acids, Glycolic Acid, Tea Tree Oil, Witchhazel. Cream Cleansers BEST FOR: DRY/ SENSITIVE/ AGING SKIN Cream cleansers are typically a thick, dense formula that is extremely moisturizing (perfect for aging skin), while they‚Äôre also great at removing makeup due to the heavy consistency. The rich consistency means that they‚Äôre less foamy, and as a result, will not dry your skin. If you‚Äôre a heavy makeup wearer, it‚Äôs better to remove makeup with a wipe or micellar water first and then finish with your cream cleanser. Some formulas even say to apply on dry skin and wipe away with a cotton ball ‚Äì in this case, it‚Äôs better to use a toner after to make sure no residue is left on your skin. Beware of: Some cream cleansers can block your pores, so look out for labels that say non-comedogenic and non-acnegenic, as this means the product has been specifically tested for this, and won‚Äôt block your pores. Best ingredients: Vitamin E, Jojoba , Shea butter . Foam Cleansers BEST FOR: OILY/ ACNE-PRONE SKIN Foaming cleansers usually come with a pump dispenser and are typically a little tougher on your skin. They‚Äôre perfect for getting rid of makeup and removing dirt and oil, but if your skin tends to be dry, it‚Äôs better to steer clear of foam cleansers as they‚Äôll strip your skin. There‚Äôs a little controversy around foam cleansers, as some believe they can be too harsh on your skin, but foam cleansers are a great option for oily-prone skin types, just be sure to follow with a moisturizer as oily skin needs moisture too! Beware of: Check the ingredients and be sure to avoid sodium laurel sulphate, as this ingredient can irritate your skin. Best ingredients: Tea Tree Oil, Salicylic Acid, Glycolic Acid, and Benzoyl Peroxide. Oil Cleansers BEST FOR: DRY SKIN/ SENSITIVE SKIN/ ECZEMA/ MAKEUP REMOVAL The theory behind cleansing oils ‚Äì an oily, watery formula ‚Äì is oil attracts oil. So, when you massage an oil cleanser into your face, those good oils bind with the sebum and any makeup oil and dirt, and when your rinse your skin all the oil is removed together. An oil cleanser is a very gentle way of removing dirt from your skin, and it doesn‚Äôt clog your pores because it doesn‚Äôt sink in, it only removes impurities. Cleansing oils will also balance and maintain your skin‚Äôs natural PH, preventing your skin from producing excess oil, like it might do to combat drying ingredients from other cleansers. The other benefit is natural oils are antibacterial and have antioxidants that help to improve your skin texture while retaining your skin‚Äôs typical moisture level. Beware of: If you have acne-prone skin, look for cleansers with the ingredients glycerin or silicone as these are non-comedogenic and non-acnegenic. Try to avoid parabens, petrolatum, phthalates, sodium laurel sulphate (SLS). Best ingredients: Grape seed, almond oil, sunflower seed oil, argan oil, green tea , vitamin E. Milk Cleansers BEST FOR: DRY/ NORMAL/ SENSITIVE/ AGING SKIN These extra-gentle milky formulas are an emulsion of fats and water, the tiny droplets of fat in the water give the formula its milk-like look and silky texture. Cleansing milk doesn‚Äôt foam, but instead, it dissolves dirt, makeup, and sebum, with oils and fats; this makes it extremely moisturizing as it won‚Äôt strip your skin with chemicals, and it‚Äôs great for removing makeup (not a full cake face). Most formulas should be massaged into the skin in circular motions and be wiped away with a tissue ‚Äì because milk cleansers are an emulsion, water will not remove them. Beware of : If you wear heavy makeup, it‚Äôs better to use a foam or gel cleanser first and follow with a milk cleanser. This double cleansing technique will ensure your face is free of makeup and the final milk cleansing step will ensure skin is soft and hydrated. Best ingredients: Natural ingredients like cucumber, rice bran oil, vitamin E, hyaluronic acid/sodium hyaluronate . Water Cleansers aka Micellar Water BEST FOR: SENSITIVE/ ACNE/ NORMAL This French creation is a super sensitive alternative to traditional cleansers, the formula looks and feels like water, but it contains tiny balls of oils molecules (micelles) suspended in soft water. The micelles contain surfactants, which attract makeup, dirt, and sebum. To use, soak a cotton pad in micellar water and wipe gently across your skin ‚Äì no scrubbing is needed as the formula draws out impurities. The formula doesn‚Äôt contain harsh chemical, is hydrating for your skin, and if you‚Äôre a heavy makeup wearer, it can be used as a gentle alternative to toners, as it won‚Äôt dry out your skin. Beware of: Nothing! This formula is ideal for all skin types and makes a perfect step for a double cleansing routine, which if you wear makeup, you should do. Use before your chosen cleanser to remove makeup, or after to remove any excess residue. Best ingredients: Some formulas contain added benefits like vitamins, rose water, rose oil, or hibiscus. Cleansing Tips: Now you know which cleanser you should be using, here‚Äôs how you can get the most from your cleanser: If you wear heavy makeup use a double cleansing method. First remove your makeup with a makeup wipe, micellar water, a foam, or gel cleanser, then follow with a cleanser suitable for your skin type. Follow with a toner or micellar water. Always use warm water to wash your face. Studies have shown hot water can dry out your skin, increase the likeliness cleansers will irritate your skin, and even cause damage to your facial capillaries and the barrier function of the skin‚Äôs surface. Once your face is clean, use a splash of cold water to close your pores. Always moisturize after your skin is cleansed, this is particularly important at night, even if you have oily or acne-prone skin , as your face loses more moisture over night than at any point.

The thing is, I feel feet can often be overlooked when it comes to beauty, but with this super-easy, at-home foot spa there‚Äôs really no excuse for it anymore. No matter how lazy or busy you are, you can relax on the couch or wear these mess-free mask socks while you‚Äôre getting ready, and voila, super soft feet without visiting the spa. What it is: Disposable sock masks filled with richly nourishing formulas that make feet baby soft in just 20 minutes. What it does: It gave me THE softest feet! It uses targeted active ingredients that aren‚Äôt just really relaxing and soothing for your feet, but they also nourish and address foot concerns too. What we liked: I loved how easy to use they were; I just put my feet inside them (be sure to separate the formula), fold each sock around my ankles and seal with the sticker. Sometimes I leave it for half an hour, or longer if I do it while I‚Äôm getting ready. My feet come out so soft, and as someone who‚Äôs always had dry skin, this is like a little miracle in a sock. I love the two fragrances ‚Äì almond and lavender ‚Äì lavender is my favorite, the smell gives you such a feeling of indulgence like you‚Äôre actually at the spa. What we didn‚Äôt like: You might feel a little bit cold while you‚Äôre using it, so make sure you‚Äôre wrapped up nicely while it‚Äôs on. You don‚Äôt even realize that you need it, but once you try this foot mask you‚Äôll totally fall in love. It‚Äôs so reasonably priced that there‚Äôs really no reason not to do this!

Which is why I felt compelled to talk about backne! Backne is an extremely common problem, most people experience some form of a blemish on their back on some point, and if you‚Äôre like me, you experience it more than often! I do combat the problem and I rarely have breakouts of any kind now, but it does take a bit of work and little patience! Here are my three steps to keeping your skin clear and banishing backne!! Bye Bye Backne: 1. CLEANSE!! Use a anti-bacterial cleanser or a cleanser that has acne fighting power! I love the Pond‚Äôs Clear Solutions Face Wash , which I use as a body wash, but it keeps my skin super clear! I love it because it has salicylic acid! 2. TONE!! Make sure you follow with a toner! I actually wrote about my favorite toner a while back and I got so many responses from women and men telling me this toner actually helped or cleared their acne that they fought with for years! Remember, don‚Äôt overload or that can cause more breakouts, just use a small amount to help get rid of any dirt! 3. MOISTURIZE!! It‚Äôs important to keep your skin dry so that bacteria cannot harvest, but keep in mind you want to regulate your skin, not dry it out! Try applying some of your favorite face moisturizer (make sure it‚Äôs oil-free) and add a hint of Tree Oil or Rose Water to the mix. This way you will get all the moisture you need with antibacterial qualities! image credits thedailygreen beauty skin Sun, 30 Jan 2011 4 Comments Related Posts The Skincare Step You Should Never Skip If You Want‚Ä¶ Mon, 30 Oct 2017 This Is The RIGHT Way To Cleanse For Model Skin Sun, 24 Dec 2017 How Your Cleanser Could Be Ruining Your Skin, And‚Ä¶ Sun, 27 Aug 2017 Carmen I will be trying this for sure!!

It gives you extreme length, but also just the right amount of thickness. It is super black which makes for a kick ass combination! The secret weapon is the brush; it‚Äôs shaped just perfectly to give you the right volume you‚Äôre looking for. For best results, I recommend using this with a Lash Primer (Makeup Forever Lash Fibers is a good choice), and lengthening mascara (Dior Iconic and Cargo Blue-Ray Mascaras are my favorite), followed by Lash DNA.

Here are three bad beauty habits to break, ASAP! 3 Bad Anti-Beauty Habits Working out in your makeup ‚Äî Makeup blocks your sweat from releasing pores and wearing even the lightest amount of makeup while you workout can cause skin to breakout. Hair overblow ‚Äî Blowdrying your hair is super drying for your hair. The affects might not be obvious right away, but subjecting your hair to such heat, causes damage and dullness of hair. Skipping the Moisturizer ‚Äî Yes, when you are young you don‚Äôt seem to need too much moisturizer, but as we mature, our skin really starts to show whether we mistreated it or not. Make it a regular habit to moisturize before bed and when you get out of the shower. This will keep your skin looking young and silky!

A smashed palette is a worthy reason for a day off work, your FAV foundations stuck at the bottom of the bottle is cause for a tantrum. Besides the fact that we love our makeup, we spend good money on it too, and we don‚Äôt want a single drop to go to waste. So, with that in mind, here‚Äôre 10 genius hacks that will do everything, from save your eyelashes, fix your mascara, save your smashed powders and more‚Ä¶ A post shared by Huda Kattan (@hudabeauty) on Aug 13, 2017 at 1:52am PDT 1. Get Every Last Bit of Lotion Cut open your beauty tubes to get all your beauty product out. This works on almost ANY plastic bottle! You‚Äôll be amazed by how much is left inside when no more will seem to come out. Scrape out the leftover product from the top half that you cut off, and put it into the bottom half. You‚Äôll then have a huge amount of product left to use, and you can seal it up again by pushing the top half over the bottom half. 2. Salvage Broken Powders We‚Äôve all lived the nightmare of watching in slow mo as our fav powder or eyeshadow drops slowly to the floor and shatters into tiny little pieces. But, there‚Äôs good news! You can save your broken powder (don‚Äôt take them traveling!) with rubbing alcohol. Add a few drops at a time until the eyeshadow turns into a thick paste, then press it down firmly with a spoon or your finger. Leave it open for the alcohol to evaporate, when it does, your powder will be good as new. 3. Save Your Foundation You found the perfect shade, the perfect coverage, and now it‚Äôs gone, but you can still see a good few dollars of foundation left at the bottom of the glass jar. Of course, the stupid pump won‚Äôt reach it. Remove the pump, tip the foundation upside down in a re-sealable pot and leave it for a few hours. When you return, the majority of the product will be waiting in the pot for you. Still more Foundation stuck inside the bottle? Add a little moisturizer and shake, et voila‚Ä¶ Tinted moisturizer. 4. Fix Broken Lipstick Nothing is messier than trying to apply lipstick when it‚Äôs broken. Fix it by gently melting the broken parts, put them back together, then place it in the fridge for around an hour to seal‚Ä¶ Lipstick fixed. 5. Revive Your False Lashes Make the most of your false lashes by cleaning and storing them properly to get up to 20 wears from them: A post shared by Huda Kattan (@hudabeauty) on Jul 5, 2017 at 11:07pm PDT See the full false lash cleaning hack here . 6. Don‚Äôt Waste Your Foundation Never apply your foundation straight onto a beauty blender or sponge, it will soak up all your foundation. Instead, dot it over your face, and spread it with your fingers or a foundation brush. Then, use your makeup sponge as the final step to perfect and blend your foundation, contour, or concealer. 7. Freshen Up Toiletries Think you‚Äôve finished your shampoo, conditioner or body wash? Add some water to it and give it a shake, you‚Äôll get more than a few more uses from them. 8. Rescue Your Lipgloss Revive your fav lip gloss with warm water. When it gets to the stage you‚Äôre literally scraping the barrel, just put the lip gloss in a glass of hot water (not boiling). The leftover product will sink to the end of the tube where the wand can reach it. 9. DIY A Unicorn Glow! Got glitters you never use, outdated bronzers and shadows, broken powders? Smash them up into a fine powder and mix it with a moisturizer or coconut oil for a homemade tinted or shimmering moisturizer. 10. De-Clump Mascara Mascara going dry and clumpy? Add a couple of eye drops into the mascara, mix about, and it will be good as new for another week at least. In a pinch, a drop of hot water will do the trick.

Especially when the little sucker pops up right before a special event! In case this happens to you, you may love me for posting this! A very effective and gentle way to banish acne and the like is to use lavender or tea tree essential oil. They are wonderful at fighting fungal infections and work as a anti-bacterial. Add a little sandalwood powder or oatmeal and mix into a paste and apply evenly to skin. Let sit for 20-30 minutes then rinse with warm water. Voila!

Not only does it lift your spirit, as well as everyone around you, but it‚Äôs so simple and can have a positive impact on someone in so many ways. As much as I love to smile at almost everyone I meet, I don‚Äôt like the affects it has on my wrinkles around my eyes. I swear by taking good care of the area, my wrinkles have reduced so much that they aren‚Äôt as noticeable as they once were. This at home eye mask is awesome for reducing wrinkles and it‚Äôs so easy to do and it only takes about 20 minutes to complete! Anti Wrinkle Eye Mask: In a bowl, mix one egg yolk and 1-2 teaspoons of honey. Apply to under eye area with ring finger and allow to sit for 20 minutes before rinsing gently with luke warm water. image courtesy of longislandeyedoctor crow egg eye feet honey mask reduce under wrinkle yolk Wed, 30 Jun 2010 8 Comments Related Posts My Absolute FAV Acne Miracle Mask! Only 3 Ingredients! Thu, 29 Dec 2016 Awesome DIY Mask for Super Soft Skin! Thu, 19 Jan 2017 This Amazing DIY Ingredient Is The Beyonce Of The‚Ä¶ Sat, 4 Nov 2017 Plati Vonnie I have very fair skin with early eye wrinkles (I‚Äôm 33 with otherwise normal skin but probably more eye wrinkles than expected for my age). I have always looked for value in eye creams, and have tried everything from Chanel to drugstore brands. My main concern now is to use only natural ingredients! I now use the Lady Soma Renewal Serum ‚Äì it is one of the best serums for the eye. I use it under concealer, which I apply immediately after. I find that the texture of serum helps to blend in the concealer so that everything doesn‚Äôt gather around the wrinkles. I do not find it too greasy for me- it seems to absorb quickly into my skin. I use it at night as well, using slightly more product for night use. I am very happy with Lady Soma for daytime use. jing jing Hi Huda, Can I ask if u have recipe anti wrinkle for all face‚Ä¶hope u have thank u so much I learn a lot from and it awesome all natural, I save my money‚Ä¶.Thank u very much.. Jing jing sam hey huda ‚Ä¶ tnx for the great tips ‚Ä¶. great info ‚Ä¶. how often do we apply the mask ???? hudabeauty So happy you like it doll!!!! üôÇ You can use the mask once a week if you like, but to be honest, all of the ingredients are so natural, if you wanted to use it every other day, it would probably be ok. I haven‚Äôt tried doing that, but the ingredients are so mild that it would probably be ok. If you do try doing this everyday, etc and you notice any type of irritation or inflammation, stop immediately. You could personally be allergic to some of the ingredients, but I only include this is a worse case scenario. Xxx Alya Doing this!!! Thanks baby!!! raena Hey huda, Is this a daily regimen? prittynachrel This i s definitely one of my favorite tricks! Eggs are such powerful anti-aging tools!

I‚Äôm in it with a bunch of really fabulous girls!!! I will post the pictures from the magazine as soon as I get them, but for now here are a couple Behind the Scenes photos as well as my interview with them!! üôÇ Me and the Gorgeously talented makeup artist, Kate Goodwin Click here to check out the final photos!! Full name: Huda Heidi Kattan Age: 27 Nationality: Arab American How long have you been in Dubai? 2 Years Official job title/ and a description of what you do as part of your job: Beauty Blogger &amp; Makeup Artist How long have you been a make up artist? How did you get in to the industry? I have been playing with makeup since I was 14, but I left to Hollywood to study a little over year ago. The decision was kind of obvious, I was working in finance, but obsessed with beauty! While I was in uni I was modeling, so getting into the industry was quite easy, thankfully! How would you describe your party style? FUNK! I love things that stand out, but still have some element of classiness in them! I love bulky jewelry and crazy shoes, with lots of faux fur! Do you have a signature style that you tend to stick to? And if so, what is it and why? As much as I like to believe I set my own trends, I love following what comes off the runway! I am constantly changing my style, but everything still has an hint of me in it and I would say it‚Äôs my own personality that comes out. There‚Äôs always a dash of color and something bold somewhere in my look! Who would be on your dream guest list for the party season? Well, I am kind of a grandma since I am pretty much married to my job, but I would love my family and close friends to be at my party. I have to admit, my friends are without doubt some of the most fabulous people I have ever met and I would love to have a super private but very fancy party with them! Of course if Jay-Z and Beyonce decided to show, I wouldn‚Äôt ask them to leave! What‚Äôs your top tip for surviving the party season? I do my best to make it to as many parties and events as possible! Being extremely busy makes it very tough at times. For me, my most important accessory for looking perfectly refreshed and gorgeous is a killer pair of false lashes. Call me crazy, but people tell me constantly it looks like I took hours to get ready, when I only had 10 minutes! They always add just the right amount of drama to your look! What‚Äôs the best party you‚Äôve ever been to and why? I really enjoyed the Hermes Party at the DIFC not too long ago. It was absolutely beautiful, but my favorite part of the party was the crowd. Everyone was really eclectic and I felt like I was in a completely different world! I felt like the guests really pushed their fashion sense and the end result was beautiful! Not to mention, they were all pretty fabulous! What‚Äôs your three beauty must-haves for the party season and why? Dramatic Lashes, Perfectly Contoured Face, and a Gorgeous Do! Simple, when you have all of these elements, everything comes together extremely fast and you always manage to look like a million bucks! artist Arts beauty blog blogger Dubai Fashion Harpers Bazaar hollywood New York Fashion Week uae Mon, 6 Dec 2010 19 Comments Related Posts Insta Glossary: Lit Mon, 6 Mar 2017 Featured in Popsugar!

Most people who have heard of this tip and tried it, more than likely have done it incorrectly, which could lead to increased redness in the area. So, how do we use this tip the right way? Simple! In the palm of your hand (make sure your hands are clean), take a dab of mint tooth paste (not gel) and mix it with a bit of warm water. Then apply the mixture to the area and let sit for 5-10 minutes, no longer. Do this every 5-6 hours until gone. image credits bellasugar at beauty blog blogger Conditions and Diseases hb health home how huda Makeup perfect pimple remedy shopping skin Skin Care Skin Disorders spot tip to tooth Toothpaste vitamin zit Mon, 6 Dec 2010 3 Comments Related Posts How These Acne Tools Could Be Making Your Skin Worse Sun, 10 Dec 2017 This Insta-Famous Face Mask Is Actually The Easiest DIY Mon, 23 Oct 2017 This Amazing DIY Ingredient Is The Beyonce Of The‚Ä¶ Sat, 4 Nov 2017 alyakattan I have tried it before!!

In Dubai alone, I have heard unbelievable stories of nose jobs at dentists‚Äô offices, breast implants by ‚Äúdoctors‚Äù and at home Botox. The worst part about these stories is the women who suffer immense trauma after the procedures. Personally, I wouldn‚Äôt expect much out of these scenarios, but recently there has been a wide spread of doctors using a Botox knock off. This product is much cheaper, so it has become quite popular. I don‚Äôt know if this sounds dangerous, but it is extremely dangerous! Side effects (which are very common) include lock jaw, muscle paralysis, respiratory complications and death. If you are considering Botox, but feel nervous, make sure you check the Doctor out. Make sure you are in a place with a clean environment and staff that are professionally equipped! Also, feel free to check what they use on you.

I LOVE a sun-kissed look but I‚Äôm all about faking it ‚Äì it‚Äôs SO much better for your skin than hours spent in the sun. Since I discovered Sally Hansen‚Äôs Airbrush Legs Makeup about five years ago, it‚Äôs been my go-to for the perfect glow and my savior on so many occasions. You can buy both cream and spray formulas, but my FAV is definitely the spray ‚Äì it always gives me the glow I need in a hurry. The best thing is, it‚Äôs not just a tan, it actually gives you ahhhmazing coverage as well. It‚Äôs like a bb cream for your legs, it blurs the appearance of scars and marks for a flawless, airbrushed look. Instead of spraying it directly on yourself you spray it onto your hands and rub the formula in, and it‚Äôs always very easy to blend, and I never get streaks (be sure to wash your hands after or use a mitt). I also love that the formula isn‚Äôt permanent, so it means I can quickly apply it to bare shoulders or legs ‚Äì like when you‚Äôre wearing a midi dress, and you only need to do up to your knees! It‚Äôs water and transfer resistant, but I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this if you‚Äôre going to a pool party ‚Äì it‚Äôs water-resistant, not waterproof! I also love that this formula comes in six shades, whereas most instant tans only offer a couple of shade options. I recommend only going two or three shades darker than your natural skin tone, as you don‚Äôt want it to look fake, and if it does happen to move, you won‚Äôt end up with super obvious white patches! I use shade Tan Glow, and it gives me a really subtle, healthy-looking tint, and I also have Deep Glow. My last and probably the most important tip is to avoid using it with fitted white clothes, it is transfer proof, but if something is rubbing your skin, there‚Äôs a good chance it will rub off on it, and that‚Äôs not worth having a tan for! Overall this is a total lifesaver, and for $13 I haven‚Äôt found anything better. Finally, you can fake yourself slimmer and use this for body contouring. If you‚Äôre wearing a mini, you can apply this down your inner thighs and on the outsides of your thighs to make them appear slimmer ‚Äì just be sure to blend so you don‚Äôt look stripey! To add to the effect, add a little highlighter down the center of your shins and thighs for a Victoria‚Äôs Secret glow.

Our latest obsession is not only amazing for your body, but it‚Äôs incredible for your skin too, it‚Äôs basically the Beyonce of the beauty world. We‚Äôre not saying oats will sing, dance, act, be gorgeous, and be cool af, but oats do have the ability to do everything from fight acne and dandruff to exfoliating and hydrating your skin. Yes, we‚Äôre talking about simple oats, like the ones you have for breakfast, and they‚Äôve been used for beautifying for more than 4000 years! Why oats are awesome: Oats are packed with anti-inflammatory properties, tons of antioxidants, vitamins, proteins, and minerals, and the complexity of oats makes them ideal for using as a home remedy for all your major skin concerns. Oats are cleansing: Oats are super absorbent and thanks to the saponins they contain, they extract excess oil and dirt from your pores ‚Äì yes, please! Oats are moisturizing: The combination of sugars, oils, and starches in oats are incredibly soothing for your skin, while oats‚Äô rich lipid content lock in moisture and act as a humectant, drawing water into your skin for ultimate hydration. Oats are food for your skin: Boasting the previously mentioned vitamins and minerals, they‚Äôre anti-inflammatory properties relieve dry, irritated skin by normalizing your skin‚Äôs PH balance, while the proteins strengthen and protect the skin‚Äôs barrier function. How to use Oats in your beauty routine: For Acne : Oatmeal is a triple threat when it comes to acne! It can be used to exfoliate pore-clogging dead skin cells, as a paste to soak up sebum, and as a balm to help inflammation caused by skin lesions. To DIY your own acne banishing skincare routine, this two-step DIY is perfect. Start with an oat exfoliator: Mix a cup of refined oats with three tablespoons of brown sugar, one tablespoon of honey, and a tablespoon of coconut oil. Gently rub the mixture onto your skin. This process removes dead skin cells that clog pores while helping to even and tone your skin. After your skin feels freshly scrubbed, wash with warm water. If you‚Äôre feeling extra (like us) follow your scrub with an oat mask. For this, cook oats as usual and then allow them to cool, thickening to form a paste. Slather the mix onto your skin and leave it to soak up excess oil for ten minutes. Oats are also packed with zinc, which as well as having unique skin rejuvenating properties, can help reduce inflammation by killing the bacteria that might be triggering your acne outbursts. For Dry and Itchy Skin : The zinc in oats also work to improve dry and itchy skin conditions like eczema. For an easy home remedy, blend oatmeal powder with hot water to form a paste and apply it to your face, leaving it on for 20 minutes to allow zinc‚Äôs anti-inflammatory properties to do its business. If you‚Äôre dealing with a serious eczema episode, try and use this oat salve every day until the problem relents. For Moisturizing Skin: The beta glucan in oats easily penetrates your epidermis as its molecules are small and quickly absorbed, immediately plumping the skin cells with moisture. From moisturizers and cleansers with an oatmeal base to DIYs, there‚Äôs a ton of ways to incorporate this natural moisturizer into your life. Our fav oatmeal mask (below) is an awesome weekly mask for keeping your skin hydrated. Our Favorite DIY Oat Mask: If you‚Äôre looking for a quick pick-me-up that will leave you feeling and looking better, give yourself an oatmeal facial. Cook together 1/2 cup hot water and 1/3 cup oatmeal, when ready remove from heat and leave it to rest until cool. When cold, mix in 1 tablespoon of plain yoghurt (packed with AHAs), 1 tablespoon of honey, turmeric, (an awesome antiaging and antibacterial powerhouse), and an egg-white for a hit of zinc and vitamin B. Apply a thin layer of the mask to your face and let it sit for 10 to 15 minutes, then rinse with warm water.

We have, and we love it! Fashion icons, Kim K, Ciara, and Rihanna have all been spotted wearing adventurous highlights in their manes and have caught our attention! Are these trendsetting divas on to something, or is this just a fad? Either way, we love it and we‚Äôre following this trend!! Great tip: Highlights are great for people who want to take focus away from traits like a slightly larger nose, etc. They are a great tool for taking attention and softening the overall appearance of the face! ‚Äì H.Kattan in celebrity From Platinum to Silver? Kate Moss Goes Gray!! by hudabeauty Thu, 29 Apr 2010 Leave a comment Well the news it out, gray is here to stay! Indeed, we saw gray streaks all over the runway, and now that Kate Moss has died her blond locks silver, it‚Äôs confirmed! But is it appealing? On the runway, exaggerated hair, makeup, clothes‚ÄîAMAZING and a total necessity. In real life, not so much. My personal thoughts, designers are geniuses who have crystal balls into the fashion future. Sometimes we hate their ideas, but 6 months later we are obsessed! For the gray streaks, I‚Äôm not ruling it out. I think it has to be done very carefully. There is a fine line between looking fashionable and looking old. I thought this quote from New York Magazine was very interesting and although controversial, it has a good point: ‚ÄúFirst the industry ‚Äî Karl Lagerfeld included ‚Äî embraces plus-size models as high-fashion models, and now gray hair is all the rage. What will be hot next? Wrinkles and saggy cleavage? Cellulite? If so, probably not in the everyday sense. If designers one day decide to make dimpled flesh the next big thing, of course they won‚Äôt hire normal women who actually have it to model their clothes. They‚Äôll send models down the runway in panty hose filled with rice or something.‚Äù ‚Äì H.Kattan in hair Proven: Fish Oil for Glossy Locks! by hudabeauty Sun, 18 Apr 2010 8 Comments BEAUTY TIP | SHINY HAIR by huda heidi kattan I‚Äôve never been one to have gorgeous hair, and frankly, I‚Äôve always been determined to have it! I knew that somewhere out there, there was a magic product that some genius somewhere created that would turn my coarse frizzy-prone hair into commercially silky hair that, possibly, moves in slow motion‚ÄìI just had no idea that that genius was God and His magic product was fish oil! We‚Äôve all heard it, Omega-3 fatty acids make your hair look super-silky, but has anyone tried it? Yup! I have! I seriously cannot believe the difference in my hair from taking Fish Oil tablets every day. Not only will it give you brilliantly glossy locks, but it will also help increase growth for your hair and improve radiance to your skin! I‚Äôm not going to lie, I hate fish more than anything and the thought of fish oil in a tablet more than mortifies me. HOWEVER, this is really not bad. The taste only last a couple of seconds and is totally bearable! Honestly, this is the easiest way to becoming a sexier you, that you must try it!

But with great boobs comes great responsibility, which means you need to CHECK YOUR BOOBS! This month it‚Äôs Breast Cancer Awareness Month, so we wanted to bring to your attention this hugely important topic and round up three things everyone with boobs should do. 1. CoppaFeel Checking your boobs every month is really, really important ‚Äì this is your number one boob priority! In the UK and US, 1 in 8 women are affected by breast cancer, and it‚Äôs still the most commonly diagnosed form of cancer in women under 40. It‚Äôs not always hereditary; actually, only 10% of breast cancers are caused by family history, sometimes there‚Äôs just no reason behind it. The good news is, checking your boobs is SO easy! The key is to check them regularly, every month, and by doing so you‚Äôll become more familiar and become better at spotting any changes in your breasts, which could be an early sign of breast cancer. Detecting breast cancer early can save your life: the five-year survival rate of early-stage breast cancer is 80-90%, falling to just 24% for diagnosis at a later stage. Look for differences in shape, size, changes in your nipples, and feel for lumps. Use the Coppafeel chart for direction and head over to the CoppaFeel page here for more details on the chart below. And remember, if you do find something different or notice any new lumps, don‚Äôt expect the worst. Go to your GP and get them to take a look; there are lots of reasons why your breasts might change, so having a professional assess them as soon as possible is key. Go to the amazing CoppaFeel site for more details on how to check your boobs and to find out more ‚Äì you can even get a boob-check reminder. 2. Get your bra properly fitted! Yes, you‚Äôve probably heard that before, but seriously it‚Äôs really important because it can cause a ton of health problems you might not even realize are a result of your bra. If your bra is too tight: Not only are you going to get quadraboob (your boobs bulging over your bra, so it looks like four boobs), but it can put tension on your stomach and ribs, giving you stomach pain and indigestion. If your bra is too big: If it‚Äôs too big, it can do even more damage than it being too small, especially if you‚Äôre a larger cup-size. If your bra‚Äôs too loose, it isn‚Äôt able to give you the right support, and it can cause the ligaments to stretch and your boobs to get saggy ‚Äì not to mention the back pain you‚Äôve no doubt experienced at some point. If your straps are too tight: Aside from the red marks on your shoulders, it can put tension on your shoulders and neck, most likely resulting in muscle ache, but it can also result in headaches ‚Äì who knew! 3 ways you know your bra doesn‚Äôt fit properly: 1) If the band keeps riding-up at the back and you find yourself pulling it down constantly, the band is too big. When you buy a bra, it should fit snugly and comfortably on the last clasp. As you wear the bra it will begin to stretch; this is when you start using the tighter clasps so that the fit remains the same. After washing, you will probably need to use the last clasp until it stretches again. 2) If your cups are gaping, or if there is any space in your cups, then you need to go down a cup or band size. If only one cup is loose, then you may need to tighten the strap or add padding for extra support. 3) If your boobs are bulging out of your bra, you need to go up a cup size. If your bra is cutting into your back or leaving marks on your back or chest, you need to go up a band size. If you have any of these problems, or you‚Äôre just not sure, the best thing to do is to go to your closest lingerie boutique and get them to fit you correctly. 3. Share this with your friends Now you know how to take care of your boobs and check them properly, tell your friends too! Every woman and man (yes, men can get breast cancer too) should check their boobs; it‚Äôs so so important. So share this with your friends and family to help spread the word. You can also donate online at CoppaFeel or to your favorite breast cancer awareness or research charity. bra fitting breast cancer awareness check your boobs coppafeel Thu, 12 Oct 2017 13 Comments Related Posts How To Fake A Boob Job In 5 Minutes Fri, 5 May 2017 7 Things You Should Do To Keep Your VJJ In Check Sat, 9 Dec 2017 Staying Flawless During Pregnancy: How To Avoid‚Ä¶ Sun, 15 Oct 2017 Urwa khan Love you soo soo much HUDA..‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è I‚Äôve really big boobs i.e. cup F and I‚Äôm only 19 yrs old.

Andrea So true! A proper bra fitting can change your posture and take years off your silhouette. Not to mention the back and neck pain from wearing the wrong size. It is so important that the person doing the fitting knows what they are doing though; the old tape measure method should be banned as it is so inaccurate. Where do you go for a fitting in Dubai?

It has pretty much revolutionized the beauty game, and so when Tarte launched an on-the-go highlight &amp; contour palette I was super excited! Tarte has transformed their original six-shade palette and created three new shades for their mini version, the Tartiest Pro To Go Highlight &amp; Contour Palette . Not only is the packaging on-point, another big bonus is that all three shades are powders, whereas the original set had a cream option, which I found could move a little too much. Not only do powders prolong wearability, but they‚Äôre perfect for when you‚Äôre already out and you just need a little touch-up. And what makes me love this palette, even more, is it smells a little chocolatey ‚Äì love! What it is: A sleek, portable contour and highlight palette with two glowing highlighters and a matte contour in powder form. What it does: Three fade-free shades have been mixed to flatter all skin tones and mimic real shadow and light reflection on the face, for the ultimate natural glow and definition. What we liked: The thing I love the most is that it‚Äôs just so compact; it literally fits in the palm of my hand and it has a mirror too, so you can use it anywhere. The contour shade, Chisel, is gorgeous. It‚Äôs dark enough for my skin tone, so if you‚Äôre fair skinned you‚Äôll need to use this sparingly. The powder is really rich and creamy, so it‚Äôs easy to pick up on your brush, but means you‚Äôll need to apply lightly. The Burst shade is so pretty, it‚Äôs a light sandy shimmer, which gives a flawless sheen. But I‚Äôm really loving the Gleam shade, the pigment is amazing and you can literally see the pearls. The only thing people with darker skin tones might find is that it could look a little grey once applied, as it is quite white toned. What we didn‚Äôt like: The Chisel shade is beautiful, but I prefer my contour to have more of an ashy tone to sculpt, whereas this is more of a bronze. So, if you like to bronze and contour separately, this might not be ideal for you. However, it‚Äôs good that this can multi-task if you need it too. Overall, I love the set, but the highlighters might not suit medium to darker skin tones. If Tarte launches more shades, it‚Äôll be a necessity for every beauty connoisseur.

But did you expect anything less from Jen Atkin, the queen of Cool Girl hair? Just check out her clients like Chrissy Teigen and the Kardashians for reference. Atkin pretty much discovered how to bottle beach hair in her Ouai Wave Spray that has a light, white musk scent (or is it jasmine? Whatever it is, we likes). It gives our locks a little bit of body and a wave that can go from subtle to beach babe depending on how we use it. We‚Äôve been stocking up since we got our hands on it. What it is: A waving spray that can be used on wet or dry hair to create a beachy wave. What it does: Uses rice protein to add hold for a natural wave look. What we liked: If you‚Äôve used wave sprays in the past, you know the deal. Either your hair gets super crunchy or weighed down. We love to use this on our wet hair and let it air dry for a subtle beachy look, and before a rough blow dry followed by an iron for more defined waves. Plus so much body! All that with no added salt in sight. What we didn‚Äôt like: That air dry tip didn‚Äôt work for our fine hair tester as much as it did for our tester with thicker hair. And though we love the smell, it‚Äôs not for everyone if you‚Äôre not into the musky-type perfume scents.

With its gold cap and accents, it looked too pretty to just be a cleanser. Plus, with a similar packaging as Tarte‚Äôs Lip &amp; Cheek Tints, we thought it could be makeup. That is, until you twist the cap open to find a black solid. It‚Äôs described as an ‚Äúexfoliating gel‚Äù ‚Äî all of which you‚Äôll mostly understand when you use it for the first time. Good luck going back after you do. What it is: An exfoliating sea algae and charcoal cleanser in the form of a solid stick that is activated to a gel when applied to wet skin. What it does: Uses charcoal powder and microexfoliants for a light scrub and cleanser that helps draw out impurities in the skin. To use, wet face, then rub on face directly until evenly applied. Use fingertips to massage on face then rinse off. What we liked: It was easy to apply, and even though it melts to a gel upon use, there‚Äôs fairly no mess. The microexfoliants scrub without being harsh and the charcoal helps to absorb oils and other impurities (charcoal is known to absorb about 200 times its weight in impurities). The cleanser has no strong discernable scent and also doubles as a mask if you leave it for a couple minutes. The result is a shine-free, dirt-free finish. The cleanser is also compact and solid which makes it good for travel and those on the go. Plus it looks pretty on our bathroom counter. What we didn‚Äôt like: The balm can‚Äôt get into the inner corners or around the nostrils upon contact but you can also use your fingers to wipe around those areas. And although it‚Äôs gentle enough to use everyday, we don‚Äôt recommend using any granule product more than 2-3 times a week! Who it‚Äôs best for: Good for all skin types, and people who usually carry around their life in their bag (we see you, Jetsetters).

None of us would say no to a perkier pair of boobs! The easiest and most pain-free way to achieve it? A little magical contouring, which takes literally only a few minutes to do. You‚Äôll instantly get a lifted appearance, and you can even make your boobs look bigger too. I think it‚Äôs insane how you can completely transform yourself with a little bit of cleverly placed makeup, and this super simple technique will instantly trick the eye into seeing a more shapely and lifted look in no time at all ‚Äì especially in photos (case in point above)!

I was sooo excited to get my hands on these two palettes, I mean, a six-shade offering in one palette is a dream. They‚Äôre great value for money as well, considering a NARS full-size blush retails for $30, and these palettes include six almost full-sized shades for $59, you‚Äôre definitely getting your money‚Äôs worth. What it is : A limited edition collection of six blush shades. Unfiltered I offers a rich collection of berry hues that will best complement darker skin tones, and the Unfiltered II palette offers six pink-toned blush shades that will suit paler skin tones. What it does: It‚Äôs designed to sculpt, shape and add a glow to cheeks with a variety of bold matte and shimmering shades. What I liked: NARS really got their packaging spot on with this, I LOVE the size and the mirrored casing, and it also includes a full-size mirror inside. Although it‚Äôs a bit big to carry around in your handbag, it‚Äôs still not too big for traveling. My favorite color was Out There, a dark dusky rose shade from the Unfiltered I palette, and I liked that they included some paler, shimmering shades in both palettes that can be used to highlight too. The texture was creamy and felt really velvety, but even though some shades seemed quite intense and buildable when applied, they did seem to wear off over the day. What I didn‚Äôt like: I was so excited about this palette, but unfortunately, the color offering disappointed me. I feel that with both palettes, the shades aren‚Äôt overly wearable and the pigment intensity wasn‚Äôt strong enough. The colors are buildable, and it also suggests wetting a brush to pick up more pigment, but I feel like I shouldn‚Äôt have to do this. I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôll be using either of these palettes again, but they‚Äôre so pretty I just have to keep them on my desk!

Check out my blog sometime: http://sayeedahsparkles.com Christine Parker I agree 100% The packaging sold me. I picked up Unfiltered II thinking those shades seemed more usable for everyday. But I must say on my medium tan skin tone they were mostly invisible. I love love NARS blush but it seems the formula is always different in their limited edition palettes. Hence a lower price point. I will also keep mine for the ‚ÄúVanity Candy‚Äù aspect.

Last July, the release of her Moonchild palette sent highlight fanatics into a frenzy, and there‚Äôs no doubt this glow kit has just as much ethereal lustre to be excited about too. One thing‚Äôs for sure, her packaging game is on point ‚Äì makeup junkies, this one‚Äôs for you. And if you were looking for a highlight to take your look to the stratosphere and back, then the Aurora palette has a surprising shade collection that‚Äôs sure to excite you. What it is: A six-shade highlighter palette designed to create intense radiance for face and body. What it does: A variety of shades give plenty of room to switch up your glow game. They can be applied with a damp brush to intensify the pigments, or mixed with a hydrating oil for a shimmering body glow. What we liked: The first thing to note is the packaging ‚Äì the gradient finish is super cool and ties in so nicely with the name, and I love the iridescent writing. The highlighters last really well and are easy to blend, although I did notice with the darker shades (Orson and Spectre), that the powders seemed a little drier and were less blendable. I love the Eclipse shade, it has a stunning peach iridescence to it, and Lyra also has a gorgeous pearly pink sheen. What we didn‚Äôt like: If you love a glittery finish to your highlight then this is the perfect palette for you, but because of the glistening effect, this would be a palette I‚Äôd mainly use in the evening. I also noticed when I applied it with a brush, the glitter was more predominant than the pigment. I would recommend using your finger and gently pressing it onto your cheeks to get the best application and pigment payoff. Moonchild or Aurora: Both palettes are gorgeous and are must-have limited edition pieces for makeup collectors ‚Äì like yours truly! I love the new colors of the Aurora palette and think they‚Äôll look best on medium to deeper skin tones, while the Moonchild has super pretty pale shades, which best complement fair to medium skin tones. For day-to-day use, my preference would be the Moonchild glow kit, but for girls who really want to pop, Aurora may come out on top for you.

Fatima I have been using this one for quite a while now.. and I‚Äôm not going back to anything else. I used to use lancome before, and then diorshow blackout, but eyes to kill is an entirely different league of mascara Natalia is it better than YSL false lashes effect??? i‚Äôm in love with it, but from ur words about this mascara, I‚Äôm afraid YSL will have to move to 2nd place! hudabeauty Hi darlings!! I do love many different mascaras! I love the YSL, some other brands as well, but for me, this is just exactly what I wanted! Sometimes, when I feel I found the best mascara, I try a new one, and sometimes it works and other times it doesn‚Äôt. Personally, this one is just GORG! Remember, mascara works differently for everyone because of lash texture, length, thickness, curl, etc. I love how bold and black this one is, but for some reason the brush also give you a gorgeous feathery look that is still very bold! I definitely recommend trying it! Hopefully you will love it as much as I do! üôÇ PS, if you wear false lashes, this is a MUST! It makes your lashes even darker!!!

In fact, I‚Äôve been waiting for a product like this! You guys probably know by now, no one loves lashes like I do and to be honest, bottom lashes need a whole different kind of attention. They are equally as important, and believe it or not, I pay so much attention to them, I actually get compliments on my bottom lashes! What I love about this new formula and wand is yes, it‚Äôs created specifically for bottom lashes, so that means so smudging, flaking or smearing like most mascaras. The wand is the perfect shape and size to give you bottom lash precision that means super sexy lashes and eyes! I‚Äôm a huge fan of making minor changes that dramatically affect the larger picture and this is one of them! image credits stylist beauty cosmetics Make-up artist Makeup product Product Review Wed, 16 Feb 2011 14 Comments Related Posts This Drugstore Mascara Just Became My Go-To Mon, 4 Sep 2017 I Tried THE Weirdest Mascara, Here‚Äôs My Verdict Sun, 1 Oct 2017 Beginner‚Äôs Guide: How To Choose The Right‚Ä¶ Fri, 17 Nov 2017 Karen I bought this recently, and I just love it!

Soursour Hi Huda, you are really gorgeous! I have a little question concerning mascara smudging. My mascara tends to ALWAYS smudge under my eyes even if I don‚Äôt put any mascara on my bottom lashes and even if I use waterproof mascara and when I get home late at night I always look like a racoon, it‚Äôs really embarrassing! I was wondering if you had any advice as to put your mascara in a specific way so it doesn‚Äôt smudge as much. Thank you in advance for your help, wish you all the best and keep up the amazing work. Alya Really!! Can‚Äôt wait to try this out!!

Check out these great hair styles and how-to‚Äôs from Allure magazine. 1. Hot Bun Humidity and gorgeous hair just don‚Äôt go hand-in-hand! A great way to fight humidity is to move your hair with it, up! While hair is wet, gather at the top of the neck and wrap it around into a little bun, secure it with an elastic and use hair pins if needed. Remember, avoid using products with heavy alcohol content like hair spray, instead try using a shine spray and a small brush/tooth brush and brush over any areas where frizz is prone. 2. Head-banded Hair When selecting a headband it is crucial to take into consideration the structure of your face shape. If you have a round face, it is best to find a headband that is flat. Heart shaped faces look better with a thin headband and oval shaped faces look great with thick bands. Simply tie around head from underneath the hair and accessorize with large shades (optional). 3. Loose Braids A great way to make braids look chic is to start the pony tails below the ear. This allows the braids to naturally loosen and gives you a sexy care-free look! 4. Textured Ponytail According to hairstylists, Antonio Prieto of Antonio Prieto Salon in NYC, the best thing to do after a day at the beach is put your hair into a low ponytail (middle of neck) and simply run your fingers through it. Simply apply some serum if neccessary and pull your hair straight back so that there is no obvious part. images courtesy of allure band braid bun celeb frizz hair loose pony style summer tail textured Thu, 17 Jun 2010 1 Comment Related Posts 4 Easy Hairstyles To Hide Your Greasy AF Hair Wed, 17 Jan 2018 5 Things You Should Never Do If You Want Hair Like Rapunzel Thu, 28 Sep 2017 Could Sleeping With Your Hair Up Cause Hair Loss?

Not only do they get to work with the industries best makeup artists and skincare specialists, but they always pick up on the coolest hacks while jet-setting across the globe. After being mesmerized by the Victoria‚Äôs Secret models all over our Instagram, here‚Äôre three things all models do that you should definitely know about too: Models know the importance of a facial massager Facial massagers are not part of the Instagram hype ‚Äì you don‚Äôt see them in every video, and not every brand is creating their own ‚Äì but it‚Äôs one of the most common tools among many models. Take a Jade roller , for example, not only can they immediately depuff your skin by stimulating lymph drainage, but over time they can diminish the look of fine lines. Then there‚Äôs the Japanese Golden Beauty Bar that you use to help your serum penetrate deeper into your skin. The gold ions and micro vibrations stimulate facial massage, while it also tightens and contours your skin. If it‚Äôll help us achieve anything close to a model bone structure, we‚Äôll try it. Models know that their necks need attention too No matter how young your face looks, a saggy turkey neck will give your age away immediately. Models know that they need to take their skincare routine all the way down to their neck as well because actually, the skin on your neck is just as sensitive as your face. This means make sure you remove any makeup here, tone, and moisturize your neck as well ‚Äì the latter is especially important. This means don‚Äôt just apply SPF to your face, but to your neck as well. We know it sounds extra, but in ten years you will thank us for it! Models know to drink crazy amounts of water Okay, so models use great skincare, and they know a ton of tips and tricks, but they also know that what‚Äôs on the inside massively reflects on the outside too. Models know that drinking loads of water is key to their skin looking gorgeous ‚Äì if you don‚Äôt drink enough water, it can make your skin look dull and emphasize fine lines (you should aim for at least 2 liters a day). It‚Äôs not just about water either, most models love green tea , which regulates hormones, controls sebum production, fights against wrinkles and has a ton of other amazing good-for-your-body benefits. And if you ask what most models drink first thing in the morning, they‚Äôll tell you they don‚Äôt start the day without a cup of lemon water, which cleanses the digestive system and contains tons of vitamin C. Moral of the story? Drink more water, and put green tea or lemon in it on the daily! model beauty model skincare tips modelling tips Mon, 27 Nov 2017 10 Comments Related Posts I Doubled My Water Intake For 7 Days And You Won‚Äôt‚Ä¶ Tue, 15 Aug 2017 This Is The RIGHT Way To Cleanse For Model Skin Sun, 24 Dec 2017 Adriana Lima Gave Me Her Secret To Shiny Hair‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ Wed, 17 May 2017 debopriya please give me solution for pigmentation .thank you for this helpful advice ig @debopriya_16 Farha Hello ma‚Äôam!

One of my favorite ways to update an appearance is to change your do! Personally, I always love changing my hair color when I want a new look, hair cuts are too bold for me, since I love long hair (I‚Äôve had short hair in the past, wasn‚Äôt my best look)! One the hottest trends this year for hair color is without doubt Red Hot Locks and it is so easy to see why! Celebrities from brunettes to blonds all took a dip into red, with shades ranging from strawberry blond to firey red! I absolutely LOOOOVE red hair right now and I would definitely try it for a change! Keep in mind, most reds don‚Äôt keep their vibrance for too long, so if you do decide to do this look, you might need to plan some maintenance to keep the radiance there! Otherwise, it‚Äôs a great and super fun change for a short time! Love it!! image credits zimbio beauty hair Makeup trend Thu, 26 May 2011 7 Comments Related Posts How to Wear a Wig!

Which is why I am beyond excited that NStyle Nail Lounge, one of Dubai‚Äôs premiere nail spas has gone mobile and is now bringing fabulous nails to a sofa near you! I cannot even begin to describe how relaxing and amazing it was to get pampered in my home‚Äìnot to mention how killer my nails looked! I watched a movie, got a massage, and answered emails and it felt AWESOME!! I can‚Äôt wait to invite some girlfriends over this weekend for a Girl Night in with some chick flicks, beauty talk and some awesome Manis/Pedis! Thank you NStyle for doing this!!!

The line created to specifically help overstressed and overworked skin, is set to launch in March and will host a number of products including a moisturizer, mask, serum, and tinted moisturizer.

If only everyone was born with perfectly flawless skin that would last throughout their lifetime! A great way to help nourish skin, without using any harmful ingredients is to use natural oils. When I was in the states recently, my skin was extremely dry, one of my friends told me that when she was pregnant, she used almond oil to keep the moisture in and also to give her skin a glow‚ÄîI have been hooked since! I actually need to head to the store, because I can‚Äôt seem to keep in stock in my bathroom cabinet! Definitely a must try if you suffer from any dry skin! Recommendation: Before Makeup: Before you apply your foundation, add a few drops of almond oil to your moisturizer. Make sure not to add too much, remember, you want a glow NOT a shiny T-zone! Let your moisture mix sit for a few minutes before blotting, then apply foundation as usual! At Night: Simply massage several drops into your face in an upward motion, I always work towards my forehead. Making sure your skin has enough moisture and the right ingredients while you sleep is essential for gorgeous skin! image credits sheknows skin Mon, 31 Jan 2011 9 Comments Related Posts Why Not Understanding Your Skin Type Is Keeping You‚Ä¶ Wed, 29 Nov 2017 How Your Moisturizing Mistakes Are Messing Up Your Skin Thu, 28 Dec 2017 DIY Face Scrub for Glowing Skin!

No, it‚Äôs our love-hate relationship with dating apps like Tinder, Bumble, and Coffee Meets Bagel ‚Äì this isn‚Äôt our fav breakfast spot. We love them because they provide thrill, excitement and give us that much-needed confidence boost when it‚Äôs a Sunday night, and we‚Äôre on the couch in our PJs, doing our best impression of Bridget and stuffing our faces with Ben &amp; Jerry‚Äôs. We hate dating apps because when it doesn‚Äôt work out, or our date turns out to be a weirdo, we blame these apps for not protecting us from the disappointment. The reality is ‚Äì love it or hate it ‚Äì if you really want to give this your best shot and get your ‚ÄòHappy Ever After,‚Äô you first need to make sure you‚Äôve upped your chances of getting the ten out of tens swiping right on your pics. So, here are our top tips for nailing the online dating game (or just your IG profile photo), in all its shallow glory! 1. Make sure you‚Äôre not just a stock image One picture is not enough, and in a world where we need proof to believe anything, putting up at least two or three photos will give your prospective love-interest some confidence that you do, in fact, exist. 2. Lighting is everything! Good lighting is the key to a great profile pic ‚Äì of course, you already knew that! You can edit most things, but if you have bad lighting, no amount of FaceTune is going to fix that. We love outdoor lighting if you‚Äôre standing in the shade, or bathroom lighting can also be really sexy (not the shocking, fluorescent kind, the warm, dim kind). 3. Strike a pose (and find your angle) From T-Rex hands to Bambi bends and over-the-shoulder looks, there are hundreds of different celebrity-certified poses and angles to glean inspiration from. Knowing your best angle and your most flauntable assets will make your 4. Get into their subconscious Sounds creepy, we know, but why not use a little psychology to your advantage? According to researchers at the Department of Psychology at the University of York, there‚Äôs three core features people inherently lookout for when sculpting first impressions from a picture: approachability, dominance, and attractiveness. As for judging attractiveness, after examining 1000‚Äôs of photos, surveys revealed that people are only really studying two things about a person‚Äôs face: eyes and mouth. People with broad, happy grins are seen to be approachable, and consequently, more relatable, and eyes were everyone‚Äôs go-to. And if you want to seem like a strong individual, good brow game will help with that! 5. The DO NOT‚ÄôS! Ditch the indoor sunglasses (no, just no) and, we‚Äôre all for Snapchat filters ‚Äì but keep it to one image with a flower crown. Boys, tweeze away that unibrow, and please, for the love of God ‚Äì don‚Äôt leave us guessing who you are in a group shot of eight guys. This one may sound pretty obvious, but only post pictures that are in focus: You have one or two seconds to get a right swipe, so why waste time on blurry shots? 6. Smize baby, smize We‚Äôre about to change your life with Tyra Bank‚Äôs top model advice: when in doubt, smize! In simple terms, smile through your eyes (yes, this does really work). Smizing will continue to draw attention to your eyes without giving you the deer caught in a headlight look. 7. Clothes maketh the man (and woman) When it comes to make or break fashion statements, we‚Äôre set on one thing, be you! But, of course, it‚Äôs always helpful to see what trends in the dating world, and the app Photofeeler, a tool that allows you to get feedback on your profile photo, found that when it came to clothing, although the results were torn, the most poignant fragments of feedback were: ‚Ä¢ Dark colors and formal attire always received more positive feedback. ‚Ä¢ Don‚Äôt cover or block your eyes. Sunglasses and hats are a big no-no for both genders because it makes you seem unapproachable. Tinder reported 12% less right swipes for sunglasses, and 15% less for hats. ‚Ä¢ The psychological effects of the color red for both men and women have been well researched. So, if you‚Äôre looking to make a grand first impression, make sure your tinder picture has some eye-catching crimson or burgundy to ignite their subconscious interest. ‚Ä¢ Ensure your clothes fit well! Our top tips for getting the most bomb Tinder pic: First of all, make sure your main pic is the best, and follows all the rules ‚Äì let‚Äôs be honest, people only ever keep looking through your photos if they‚Äôre not sure (or you‚Äôre really hot!). According to data at Tinder, here are our final tips for what you need to do to up your chances of getting a swipe in the right direction: ‚Ä¢ Smile: 14% more likely to get a right swipe ‚Ä¢ Face the camera directly: 20% more likely to get a right swipe ‚Ä¢ Avoid selfies: particularly for men, you‚Äôre lessening your chances of a swipe. Girls, put away the duck face pout. ‚Ä¢ Make sure the pic clearly shows your face! One of the most important tools to arm yourself with when taking your next Tinder profile picture is confidence and originality. Whether online or offline, a great personality and positive appearance will win you more swipe rights than any photo filter ever could. best tinder profile pic profile pic tinder Tue, 7 Nov 2017 3 Comments Related Posts THE Most Magical Airbrush Apps For Flawless Selfies Sat, 22 Apr 2017 Slay Your Selfie With These Ultimate Poses Fri, 29 Sep 2017 Why We Chose Faiza Rammuny, AKA ExpiredNFabulous as‚Ä¶ Mon, 22 Jan 2018 kahlan LOL!

Not only is Faiza Rammuny funny AF, her Instagram channel guarantees you‚Äôll be binge-watching her videos and loling for at least 30 minutes, but Faiza is also a huge inspiration! Going against family and cultural expectations, Faiza came through to share her struggles, make us laugh, and be an agony aunt to all of us ‚Äì seriously, message her with your relationship issues, and she will be there! Her main message is self-love, and we couldn‚Äôt agree with her more. Here‚Äôs why we love her: What‚Äôs your most inspiring/ empowering quote? I often say, ‚ÄúFeel to Heal,‚Äù because I feel that it‚Äôs very important to FEEL through all of the emotions that life throws at you: the good, the bad, and the really really ugly. Don‚Äôt put a bandaid over a bullet hole in your heart. You‚Äôre hurting, hurt. You‚Äôre sad, be sad. You‚Äôre angry, be angry. I firmly believe that our emotions and ability to feel them is what makes women so powerful. Who‚Äôs your icon? Princess Diana. I think she showed women that sometimes you have to go against the grain to find your happiness and make real change in this world. Where do you usually get inspiration from? My past i.e. upbringing, family, dating, heartbreak, and embarrassing circumstances I have found and still find myself in. I get SO much inspiration at night when I‚Äôm replaying my day, week, or revisiting the past in my head. I sleep with a notepad and a pen on my nightstand. A post shared by Faiza Rammuny: üêßMama Penguinüêß (@expirednfabulous) on Oct 30, 2017 at 12:07pm PDT What‚Äôs the weirdest place you found inspiration? Parking space 360 at the Metra Train Station near my house. After my almost three-year relationship ended, I went there to cry, escape, heal, and write content. I never thought I would be inspired by a damn parking space, but there you have it. As a woman boss, we would love to know how you‚Äôve made it so far? I found my purpose. Then I went all in with hard work, dedi-fucken-cation, and sacrifice. I quit a great job, struggled financially, went against family expectations and culture to be doing what I do today. I made it far because I was willing to lose it all, if only to say I tried. What drives you? My penguins (followers) I hate calling them followers, it sounds so Manson family. They drive me forward every single day. Sharing their stories, their lives, and their vulnerabilities with me is SO inspiring and drives me every day to give many a voice that they don‚Äôt have. Any tips you can give to others? Be YOU! Don‚Äôt let society, family, culture, or anyone tell you who that‚Äôs supposed to be. Find out for yourself. Make your own rules. Understand that mistakes mold you. I never thought that I could be accepted for ME because I was raised in a rigid culture that constantly pointed out my ‚Äúfaults.‚Äù Today almost three hundred thousand people around the world see those ‚Äúfaults,‚Äù and love them about as much as I do.

Check out my latest creation‚Ä¶ temperature changing nail polish with a chrome overlay. Everyone‚Äôs been raving about this nail polish, so I finally decided on this pretty pink shade, and I love it so much. It changes color when the temperature reaches 91¬∞F, so even when you get just a little bit warmer ‚Äì your normal temperature is 98.6 ¬∞F ‚Äì you get this really cool ombr√© effect on your nails. How much cuter is it with this shimmering chrome overlay? I‚Äôm obsessed! Get my look: I painted my acrylic nails with two coats of temperature changing polish, applied a clear chrome powder, and then sealed it with a gel top coat. in Nail My Nail Polish Collaboration with Formula X! by hudabeauty Thu, 13 Oct 2016 5 Comments Hey My Loves! You may have already seen my post and video announcing my new collaboration with Formula X ! I‚Äôve always loved the finish of Formula X polishes ‚Äî they go on so beautifully and are really long-lasting so when they asked me to collab with them on a few colors, it was a no-brainer for me! I really hope you love these colors as much as I do. There was so much going on my mood board when I was trying to decide what I had to have in this collection, but I boiled it down to these must-have colors for the Fall! Jetsetter (a gunmetal black with a platinum shimmer) ‚Äì I thought this color was very futuristic. It made me think of the universe, and the galaxy. It‚Äôs a twist and a notch more festive than a classic black. And of course, the name is very much reflective of my life these days! Date Night (deep plum with red undertones) ‚Äì I really love getting a burgundy color like this ‚Äî it‚Äôs my go to for date night (hence the name!). I also thought it was a gorgeous, deep color perfect for fall. Baroque Babe (a metallic rose gold) ‚Äì This is my go-to color of the moment. It‚Äôs really been the color of MY YEAR, and I couldn‚Äôt do this collection without it. I really wanted to make statement-making shades that were super versatile to wear on any occasion. The shades are sophisticated and rich‚Äì the gold and silver accents were added as a play on the finer things in life, and the decadent burgundy is marked with an elegance I really wanted in this collection. The shades are limited-edition and available for purchase in Sephora US and Canada, and on sephora.com for $12.50 each! What do you guys think about the colors?? As always, thank you so much for the support and love! Xx in Nail , Tutorial Eyeshadow on Your Nails? It Works! by hudabeauty Wed, 21 Sep 2016 1 Comment Hey my loves!

If the name still doesn‚Äôt ring any bells, check the packaging of your favorite deep cleansing exfoliator, anti-wrinkle cream, or serum ‚Äì there‚Äôs a good chance you‚Äôll find the name on the packaging. AHA‚Äôs ability to smooth deep wrinkles, erase skin pigmentation, and promote even, smooth skin makes it one of our must-have products in our beauty regimes, and one you should definitely be using, if you‚Äôre not already. What Are AHAs? Alpha hydroxy acids are basically a natural chemical exfoliator, so instead of using abrasive creams to rub away dead skin, AHAs have the unique ability to penetrate the skin and breakdown dead skin cells. AHAs are found in fruits, milk, and sugars: citric acid from citrus fruits (that figures), glycolic acid is sourced from sugar cane, lactic acid is found in sour milk, malic acid is extracted from apples and pears, and tartaric acid can be found in grapes ‚Äì yes that means there are lots of DIY AHA masks you can create (more on that later). What AHAs Do: AHAs are an exfoliant that gently works to remove the top layer of dead skin by ‚Äòungluing‚Äô the old cells still stuck to the epidermis. This gives way to new skin cell regrowth and also helps to stimulate collagen and elastin production. This spring cleaning of your epidermis helps to improve wrinkles and pigmentation, and will leave your skin super smooth! AHAs are amazing for everyone, especially aging skin, but they also work brilliantly for: Acne: Introducing a weekly AHA peel is incredible for acne-prone skin. The acid will penetrate and strip away dead skins cells that can block pores and lead to acne. Scars : For fast scar removal, buy an exfoliator with 4% or more of AHA, which will speed up the removal of dead skin and smooth any scar tissue. An overnight moisturizer or serum under 10% concentration will extend the process. If you‚Äôre looking to remove scaring fast, applying 70% glycolic acid in a series of peels helps immensely to reduce the appearance of scars. Wrinkled or Dry Skin (Xerosis) : For treating wrinkles, sun damage, and dry skin, AHA creams and serums around 8% concentration are incredible for erasing fine lines and tightening tired, damaged skin. AHAs‚Äô ability to increase water retention in your cells will also help them combat signs of dryness, further improving the appearance of wrinkles. How To Use AHAs: In your skincare: AHAs work best in skincare products if the concentration is between 5% to 8%, and you can find them in your moisturizer, cleanser, exfoliators and even suncreams. Because AHAs should be left on your skin, they are most effective in a moisturizer or exfoliating mask. Look out for glycolic and lactic acids on your labels as these have been proven to give the best results. Because AHAs make your skin more sensitive to sunlight you should always wear SPF when using them to protect the new skin on the surface. As a treatment: You can receive chemical peels from a doctor, dermatologist, or local beauty clinic. A chemical peel uses a much higher dose of AHAs (around 50% to 70%), and these give similar results to microdermabrasion and will help to improve acne, wrinkles, pigmentation, and uneven skin tone. It gets its name because it literally causes your skin to peel for up to a few days, or even a week afterward, but the results are much more effective than at home skincare treatments and can last up to 2 years. Our fav formula: Ole Henriksen‚Äôs Power Peel is a 3-step facial system that includes a scrub, followed by a lemon AHA peel, and a soothing clay mask. This is the ultimate 3-step at home facial, check out the review here . Our Fav DIY AHA Masks: Fruit acid mask with strawberries and lime: Not only are most zingy fruits AHAs but citrus fruits like limes, lemons and kiwis are filled with antioxidants, which help combat free radicals and keep cells healthy and rejuvenated. Mash up two large strawberries or five or six small strawberries and mix with half a lime (you can either squeeze the lime juice into the strawberry mix or include the lime pulp as well). Leave it on your face for 10 to 20 minutes (whatever is comfortable for you), then rinse off with water thoroughly. Lactic acid mask with yogurt and honey: Yoghurt contains lactic acid, another form of AHA, so if you‚Äôre looking to fight the clock, this one‚Äôs your boo. Lactic acid helps dissolve dead skin, tighten pores, and reduces the appearance of those pesky fine lines. Mix in honey (which is soothing and also has anti-bacterial properties), and you‚Äôve got an extra powerful skin rejuvenating mask. Combine one heaped teaspoon of natural yogurt and one teaspoon of honey, (you can add a squeeze of lemon if you have any), and leave on for twenty minutes, before rinsing with a face cloth.

Just take the peel of a ripe banana (not overripe, you want one that‚Äôs yellow with a few dark spots), and rub it on your blemish for ten minutes or so. You‚Äôll see a big difference in your acne, especially after a few days. Why does this work? A lot of reasons! Bananas have so many anti-inflammatories, like vitamin A, zinc, and manganese. The peels are also natural exfoliants to remove toxins and helps to prevent bacterial infections that may contribute to acne. The enzymes help to heal scars and prevent new pimples from popping up, and the starch unclogs your pore. It‚Äôs basically an anti-acne powerhouse! #repost #hudabeauty A post shared by Huda Kattan (@hudabeauty) on Apr 26, 2017 at 9:17am PDT You know me, I feel compelled to try crazy, bizarre beauty ideas!

That‚Äôs why we consider it our duty to keep you up-to-date with the most in demand beauty products, so you don‚Äôt go onto Sephora only to have your day completely ruined by a big red SOLD OUT sign ‚Äì few things cause us more pain. Here are the beauty products creating waves on IG for August (hint, the Kardashian‚Äôs are leading the pack). Kat Von D Everlasting Glimmer Veil A post shared by Kat Von D Beauty (@katvondbeauty) on Aug 2, 2017 at 3:10pm PDT Kat has released some seriously dope products lately ‚Äì especially her Lock It Brightening Powder, my new go-to . Now she‚Äôs adding to her flawless lip collection with an Everlasting Glimmer Veil glistening lipstick formula, which she says is ‚Äúlike heaven on your lips, longwear AF, and designed to be worn by itself or over any other longwear formula‚Äù ‚Äì yaaaas! Of course, in true Kat fashion each of the nine shades is bold, bright, and on point! You can snag yourself one for $22 on Sephora.com from August 22 nd , or if you just can‚Äôt wait, you can grab Kat‚Äôs blue Reverb shade on her website tomorrow. Ouai Memory Mist A post shared by OUAI Haircare (@theouai) on Jul 9, 2017 at 7:07pm PDT When it comes to hair, Jen Atkin can do no wrong; she‚Äôs like the hair queen. Her latest innovation to make it to the top of our wish list is set to be the new royalty of hairspray. Jen‚Äôs Memory Mist is a spray that you use before styling, and as you style, the heat from your hot irons or blow dryer will activate memory technology and lock down your style until your next wash ‚Äì we NEED a bottle! (Full review on the blog soon). KKW Beauty A post shared by KKWBEAUTY (@kkwbeauty) on Jul 12, 2017 at 10:06am PDT We don‚Äôt know what, but something is coming! The speculation is that it‚Äôll help us achieve Kim‚Äôs famous glow and dewy complexion ‚Äì we can at least hope! Or, could it have something to do with her major eye look in this Insta post, maybe it‚Äôs an eyeliner?! Whatever she releases we have no doubt it will sell out in minutes like her contour sticks did last month ‚Äì read my review of them here . Wander Beauty Lipsetter Dual Lipstick and Liner A post shared by Wander Beauty (@wander_beauty) on Jul 20, 2017 at 2:15pm PDT We‚Äôre all for multitasking when it comes to beauty, so this crafty new double-ended lip liner and lipstick combination from new brand Wander Beauty is right up our alley. The only downside is it comes in just five shades, so make sure you grab your fav before it‚Äôs gone. Fenti Beauty (AKA Rihanna‚Äôs new beauty brand) A post shared by Fenty Beauty By Rihanna (@fentybeauty) on Aug 1, 2017 at 12:03pm PDT Okay, okay, it‚Äôs not launching until September, but we‚Äôre SOOO excited for Rihanna to launch her beauty brand ‚Äì major forewarning is very necessary! Rumors are she‚Äôll be releasing a highlighter and holographic lip product and we just know it‚Äôs gonna slay. If RiRi‚Äôs beauty is as bold as her style, we expect nothing less than a seriously blinding highlight, and some seriously bold holographic lip shades. Her collection will be available globally at Sephora and Harvey Nichols from September 8. Follow her @fentybeauty Insta for updates. Tatcha The Body Mist A post shared by TATCHA Beauty (@tatcha) on Jul 13, 2017 at 5:33pm PDT It‚Äôs August, it‚Äôs hot AF outside, and whether you live in Dubai or anywhere else, chances are a refreshing mist will be more than welcome. This mist by incredible new skincare brand Tatcha will not only invigorate your skin using a mix of botanical oils to give you a subtle glow, it‚Äôll help support your skin‚Äôs natural barrier and lock-in moisture. If you miss this luxury limited edition spray, I swear by Avene‚Äôs Thermal Spring Water , and you can grab it at any of your local drugstores for less than $10. The Freshest Blogger Collabs: Jeffree Star X Jouer Cosmetics A post shared by Jeffree Star (@jeffreestar) on Aug 2, 2017 at 4:21pm PDT You can always rely on Jeffree Star to keep it 100, so you know when he does a collaboration, he‚Äôs only going to create something seriously bomb. Just today he revealed he‚Äôs releasing a product with Jouer, ‚Äòsomething sweet‚Äô, and we‚Äôre psyched because we only have to wait until September for its release. We‚Äôre also super impressed because Jeffree has stated he‚Äôll be donating his proceeds to the Los Angeles LGBT center, which we love. Desi X Katy X Dose of Colors Collection A post shared by D E S I ‚Ä¢ P E R K I N S (@desiperkins) on Aug 2, 2017 at 5:10pm PDT Yep, not just one blogger collab, but a blogger x blogger x brand collab! Just last night the gorgeous Desi Perkins and Katy, aka @Lustrelux, revealed their full collection with Dose of Colors and it‚Äôs even more sparkly than Kylie Jenner‚Äôs Birthday Collection. The release includes an indulgent collection of lip products as well as one seriously statement lip gloss appropriately named Over The Top, plus a four shade eyeshadow palette and some unreal highlighters. The collection arrives on August 14. Manny MUA Merchandise A post shared by üåôManny Gutierrez (@mannymua733) on Jul 26, 2017 at 7:00pm PDT Beauty blogging sweetheart Manny MUA is launching not makeup, but clothing!

Fearless and empowered, Nabela is exactly the kind of friend we all need in our lives. While her highlight and lipstick are always on point and her videos will teach you to color correct like you never knew possible, Nabela is so much more than a YouTuber; she is making waves in the industry to advocate for women of all shapes, sizes, cultures, and ethnicities. We love Nabela for her incredibly motivating captions as much as her amazing makeup tutorials. Here‚Äôs why she‚Äôs this week‚Äôs #WomanBoss: What‚Äôs your most inspiring/ empowering quote? I always say, ‚ÄúI will not reserve my happiness for a later date or a later weight.‚Äù I became liberated and my happiest when I stopped waiting to be happy. Postponing my self-confidence for a certain number on a scale was not helping me love who I am today. So, I stopped waiting and decided whoever I was today and however I looked today was good enough and worthy of love. And it‚Äôs changed my life. What‚Äôs the first thing you do in the morning, and before you go to sleep? The first thing and the last thing I do every day is actually the exact same thing! I list out everything I‚Äôm grateful for in a gratitude journal and re-center myself in a place of thankfulness. It‚Äôs the best way to start and end each day, I promise you. What keeps you motivated? My mission keeps me motivated. I want to bring visibility for girls like me in beauty, fashion, and entertainment. Brown girls. Muslim girls. Plus size girls. I want to keep shining my light in hopes to inspire other girls to shine their own light as well. I want to keep enforcing messages of tolerance, acceptance, and unity in all that I do. Your biggest challenge? Along with urging for representation for Muslim and Brown girls, I use my platform to advocate for representation for the plus size community as well. So, a huge challenge has been the resistance from the beauty, fashion and entertainment industry to include plus size women in the narrative. And not just include us to say that they‚Äôre including us. But to truly uplift us and portray us in the equal and gracious light we deserve. Huda has been so great at doing just that, and I‚Äôm forever thankful for her dedication to inclusion. What would you be doing if you weren‚Äôt where you are now? Definitely working in politics and government, specifically at the United Nations where I could focus on advocacy. Where do you usually get inspiration from? Trailblazers inspire me, regardless of what industry they belong to. I can spend hours listening to leaders from all areas. I also get inspired by ideas. Ideas change the world and the idea of a world where everyone feels seen, heard and represented truly inspires me every day. A post shared by Nabela Noor (@nabela) on Jan 4, 2018 at 9:15am PST Something you‚Äôve never told anyone before? My first channel on Youtube was actually a music channel. I created my beauty channel as a second channel for fun. The beauty channel kicked off, and I later deleted my music channel but promised myself I‚Äôd release music one day to my audience. This year I‚Äôm doing just that!! What advice would you give to aspiring MUAs I love this quote: ‚ÄúDo the best you can with what you have.‚Äù In this social media world where it can always feel like nothing is ever enough, it‚Äôs so important to remember to do the best you can with what you have. It‚Äôs okay if you don‚Äôt have the best equipment or setup or backdrop or makeup, do the best you can. Whatever you want to do, just do the best you can possibly do with what you have. You have something unique and special to offer the world so discover what that is and own it and don‚Äôt let comparison keep you down. Rise above and keep shining!

You‚Äôll see a big difference in your acne, especially after a few days. Why does this work? A lot of reasons! Bananas have so many anti-inflammatories, like vitamin A, zinc, and manganese. The peels are also natural exfoliants to remove toxins and helps to prevent bacterial infections that may contribute to acne. The enzymes help to heal scars and prevent new pimples from popping up, and the starch unclogs your pore. It‚Äôs basically an anti-acne powerhouse!

It‚Äôs bad enough having Facebook remind us daily of the very public conversations we used to have with our friends on their Facebook page, and then there‚Äôs the text typing language too ‚Äì you know what we mean: GR8, BRB, Skool, L8R, and lol (still guilty of the last one, we admit!). While we‚Äôre over the clumpy mascara look that was major goals of the early 2000s, and finally, most of our eyebrows have recovered from being plucked to a tiny fine line, there‚Äôs still more than a few practices we‚Äôre not guilty of quitting. Here‚Äôre five you‚Äôre probably still doing, that you really should stop, like ten years ago already! Toothpaste on your pimples Seeing as we all use toothpaste every single day, it‚Äôs readily available, and it doesn‚Äôt cost a bomb, when our BFF told us it would get rid of our pimples, we were more than keen to try it out ‚Äì what a magical solution! Unfortunately, although toothpaste may dry up your pimples, in the long run, it‚Äôs going to do way more damage than just drying up your pimple (see the full story here ). The good thing is, there are lots of spot-zapping treatments that will do the trick way better than toothpaste, and they won‚Äôt cause long-lasting damage to your skin. We love to use tea tree gels and Witch blemish sticks, which you can find variations of in all your local drugstores. Squeezing your spots wrong There‚Äôs a wrong way and a right way to deal with pimples and blackheads, and squeezing as hard as you can with all kinds of tools is definitely not the answer. Your skin is fragile and sensitive, and pushing and pulling on your skin will only do more harm than good. Check out our guide to squeezing pimples and blackheads the right way here . Not washing your makeup brushes We admit, washing our makeup brushes is quite possibly one of the most boring tasks ‚Äì although seeing all the dirt coming off is insanely satisfying! We know it seems perfectly harmless, but unwashed makeup brushes and beauty sponges can harbor all kinds of bacteria, as well as accumulating dead skin cells. This means if you‚Äôre not washing your makeup brushes, you could be causing breakouts and clogged pores (see my guide to washing your brushes here ). We recommend washing your makeup brushes every week and your makeup sponge after every use . If you really can‚Äôt be bothered to wash all your brushes, at least focus on your foundation and concealer brush, or any brush that you use with liquid and cream formulas. A post shared by Huda Kattan (@hudabeauty) on Aug 19, 2017 at 1:30am PDT Peeling off your gel polish The struggle to not pick away at our gel manicure when it starts to chip and come away from our nail bed is VERY real! But we‚Äôre here‚Äôs why you need to fight the urge to rip off your gel polish and instead remove them properly. When you peel off your gel varnish, it also pulls away the delicate top layers of your nails, which not only results in white patches, which don‚Äôt look pretty, but it significantly weakens the nail. The more often you do this, the more layers of skin are removed, and not to mention the nail beds are buffed every time gel polish is applied. The damage from repeatedly peeling away your gel varnish can take months to heal. If you can‚Äôt make it for a top up, you can easily remove your gel mani at home. How to DIY gel polish removal: Gently file the top layer of the nail varnish away. Cut cotton pads into quarters (you‚Äôll need one quarter for each finger), and cut aluminum foil into ten sheets (roughly 10cm X 10cm). Soak the cotton pad quarters in in an acetone nail varnish remover and one finger at a time, place the quarter onto your nail and wrap it with a sheet of foil as tightly as possible. Leave it on for at least 15 minutes. When you remove the foil, the gel varnish will have dissolved and will have come away from your nail. You can repeat the process if not all of the varnish comes away immediately. Bleaching your mustache If you ever had a stupid boy at your school call you up on your fluffy mustache and you resorted to what seemed like the most obvious solution, bleach, then now is the time to move on. Unfortunately bleaching your mustache may make the dark hairs appear slightly less visible, but in the light of day, your bright white hair will literally glisten in the sunlight. Try threading or waxing, and if you don‚Äôt fancy spending the dollars, we swear by Veet‚Äôs face wax strips, ( $8, here ). Our top tip is to dust a fine layer of talcum powder on your upper lip before you apply the wax strip. This should prevent the wax strip from potentially ripping away any skin. beauty mistakes beauty tips teen mistakes Fri, 22 Dec 2017 4 Comments Related Posts The ONLY Way I Clean My Makeup Brushes Sat, 19 Aug 2017 Will Toothpaste Actually Kill Your Pimples?

Here‚Äôs what I used and how: A post shared by Huda Kattan (@hudabeauty) on Jun 7, 2017 at 1:09am PDT FOUNDATION: Huda Beauty Foundation (our formula is still a secret!) The base of all makeup and my daily essential is a foundation for flawless skin. I can‚Äôt wait for you guys to try our formula, but until then this is my everyday essential! I also love Tarte‚Äôs new Amazonian Clay Foundation Sticks for flawless full coverage, check out my review! CONCEALER/ CONTOUR: Tarte Shape Tape in Medium A good concealer is a must in any makeup bag or handbag! Tarte‚Äôs Shape Tape is an amazing formula, which not only works wonders for covering blemishes, but I LOVE it for brightening under eyes and contouring too. HIGHLIGHTER: Huda Beauty 3D Highlighter Golden Sands Edition Rich, creamy, and long lasting, the fact that I can use our new highlighter palette as a crease-free eyeshadow, for strobing, and my cheeks, makes it my every day go-to. BROWS/ EYELINER: Benefit Cosmetics K-Brow in shade Number 4 Hands down my FAV brow product, Benefit just get brows! I love this formula as I can also use it as an eyeliner and eyeshadow. LASHES: Huda Beauty Farah Lashes In my opinion, lashes make everyone look even more gorgeous, and it just adds that beautiful, sultry finish to your look. LIPS/BLUSH/ EYESHADOW: Huda Beauty Liquid Matte in Girlfriend Lips are such a defining facial feature, and some of you might have noticed I‚Äôm obsessed with a matte finish! I love that our new nude Girlfriend shade works as a stunning natural lip shade, and it‚Äôs perfect for adding a hint of color to cheeks. POWDER: Guerlain Blanc De Perle Brightening Compact Foundation I use the white illuminating powder under my eyes to brighten the area and add dimension to my face. This compact also has a foundation in, so it‚Äôs a really handy compact to travel with as it contains foundation and powder.

Just take the peel of a ripe banana (not overripe, you want one that‚Äôs yellow with a few dark spots), and rub it on your blemish for ten minutes or so. You‚Äôll see a big difference in your acne, especially after a few days. Why does this work? A lot of reasons! Bananas have so many anti-inflammatories, like vitamin A, zinc, and manganese. The peels are also natural exfoliants to remove toxins and helps to prevent bacterial infections that may contribute to acne. The enzymes help to heal scars and prevent new pimples from popping up, and the starch unclogs your pore. It‚Äôs basically an anti-acne powerhouse!

We imagine right now you‚Äôre having some pretty cringey flashbacks; remember chains dangling from your pockets, Juicy Couture was hot af, and Claire‚Äôs Accessories was the bomb ‚Äì we die! Well, we thought we‚Äôd reminisce some of the most hilarious trends from our millennial teens, you know, that grey area between the end of the 90s and the early 2000s, just for fun‚Ä¶ The Hair It was a time for bright butterfly clips, two tiny little hair tendrils framing your face, crimped sections, and those little twisty pieces of hair carefully pinned to your head by the aforementioned butterfly clips! Of course, all our fav icons wore them; Sabrina The Teenage Witch, Britney, Topanga, and Christina ‚Äì major goals! The Makeup Where do we begin? Chalky white or bright blue eyeshadow was the look du jour, of course carefully topped off with purple mascara and non-tour ‚Äì it‚Äôs hard to believe contouring didn‚Äôt even exist at that point. Then, there was the super glossy lip and the over-plucked brows that we‚Äôre still recovering from to this day. What were we thinking, and can you believe we thought this looked good?! A post shared by Huda Kattan (@hudabeauty) on Nov 16, 2017 at 7:48am PST The Clothes It‚Äôs kinda funny to see how many of the trends from our teens have actually come back into fashion; who else got a weird sense of d√©j√† vu fondling a new pair of hoop earrings and velvet choker? Fortunately, there are some things which haven‚Äôt come back in: boleros (THE must-have mini cardigan!), disco style halter neck tops, ¬æ length jeans, velour tracksuits (if you were lucky you had a pair from Juicy Couture), and then, of course, there were crop tops (back in again!), and boob tubes. OMG, and remember wearing dresses over jeans, denim minis, and RaRa skirts ‚Äì it‚Äôs too much to handle. We can just be thankful that we didn‚Äôt have phones at that point to document every outfit and makeup look with selfies! The Music We don‚Äôt know about you, but the music from our teens gives us MAJOR vibes, and you cannot imagine how much fun we had compiling these iconic tracks from our teen years!

After following her work of Karl Lagerfeld and seeing her brilliantly plastered on the pages of Harper‚Äôs Bazaar, the little Picasso is making a name for herself as one of the most talented young artists coming out of Dubai! Her recent images left me amazed as usual! How cool is this video!! The artist, Sherihan, which was the inspiration behind Khawla‚Äôs last project, was the Lady GaGa of the 80‚Äôs in the Arab world! She was definitely gutsy, the song is a bit crazy, but her outfits were outrageous and gorgeous! Love it!!

Nicki Minaj and her collection of crazy bobs! What do you guys think of this hot pink longer one? Eva Pigford hot as usual. Love the dress and her blond short hair is signature Eva and gorgeous! Ashley Greene stunned last night! She looks beautiful and her highlights really bronze her up! Luckily for Taylor, Kanye wasn‚Äôt in sight! Her Old-Hollywood curls are gorgeous! Ciara looked amazing in this Givenchy dress! Her body, hair, makeup, everything! The look is just perfectly put together! Katy Perry looked gorgeous in this dress, although, I personally am not a huge fan of the highlights in her hair. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I had hot pink highlights in my hair in highschool, I just don‚Äôt like the way it‚Äôs styled with the highlights! Her nails are wicked though! I guess she really loves Russell Brand enough to look at his face 10 times! I have to give it to my boys! Pharrell Williams and Usher Raymond looked amazing last night.

I‚Äôm so excited to share with you that our 3 latest #HudaBeautyLiquidMatte shades; Socialite, Showgirl &amp; Silverfox ‚Äì will be available on shophudabeauty.com the 1st of March! Socialite &amp; Showgirl have already been part of our mini editions, but Silverfox is a brand new addition to our Liquid Matte line. And yes, it is a tribute to my hubby Chris (or as you guys know him, @silverfox08 on Insta)! This is a super special color for me, not just because of my boo, but it‚Äôs a great shade to wear on its own, or together with another shade. My fav combo is Icon &amp; Silverfox, and the office favorite is Muse &amp; Silverfox. Adding a grey lipstick to any red or pink toned shade will help mute it and cool it down, creating something completely new and unexpected! That‚Äôs probably why I love that shade so much, you can create a lot of different looks with it, or just wear it on its own to master that modern rock/come-to-slay look. Will be showing some more looks on my Insta &amp; Snapchat (realhudabeauty) soon ‚Äì so stay tuned!

I really wanted to show you guys different ways to use this color ‚Äì one being mixing it with other colors (which is my fav!). Silver Fox is def one of those daring, sexy Lipsticks that you can experiment with by mixing it with different colors and tones. My fav Liquid Lipstick combo right now is Icon &amp; Silver Fox! Basically, you first apply a layer of Icon, and then apply a layer of Silver Fox. Adding a grey lipstick to any red or pink toned shade will help mute it and cool it down, creating something completely new and unexpected!

Try using this tip on days when you have a bit more time and watch your feet become softer each time! SUPER SOFT FEET SOAK : 6 cups hot water 2 cups milk 2-3 drops lavender extract (optional) Mix ingredients together in large bowl and make sure temperature is comfortable for feet. Let feet sit for 10 minutes, then remove from soak and pat dry.

Even Kim hadn‚Äôt teased the products on social, so I was confused, but also hyped because her new collection, Ultralight Beams Highlighters and Glosses, SLAYS. What it is: A collection of five super shimmery, glitter lip glosses, and five loose pigments, each in bronze, gold and silver shades. What it does: The glosses are super thick and add high impact shine to your pout, while the loose pigments can be used anywhere on the face or body. What we liked: I‚Äôll start by saying I‚Äôm not a gloss person, but as far as glosses go, these felt really nice on the lips. I like that the texture is thick, so I feel like the formula will last for a long time, but they‚Äôre also very sheer so I think they would look best on top of a liquid lipstick to give them more dimension. I love, LOVE, love the loose pigments! The colors are soo pretty, and they look amazing on. The formula is a little dry so they would likely move if used alone, but with a little fixing spray to hold them in place, they look stunning packed on the eyelid. I think the white shade (Iridescent) is bomb, and I love mixing the colors to create your own shades ‚Äì I mixed the gold and copper tones, and the combination was divine. What we didn‚Äôt like: The glosses are very glittery, so I worry that they could look a bit kiddish if used by themselves, but they layer gorgeously on top of colors. As soon as we posted about these, we got a lot of comments saying they looked like Stila; I honestly don‚Äôt think they do at all, the packaging is really beautiful with the classic pale pink shade that KKW Beauty is known for, and the glosses have a sleek, soft-touch lid. My tip: For the pigments, take a small, flat concealer brush, and spray a little fixing spray onto it and pat it across your eyelid. Using the same brush, pick up the pigments and press them onto your eyelid. This will give you the best control and insane coverage! Price: Not yet released Available: KKWBeauty.com (December 1 st , 2017) See my immediate reaction to receiving the new KKW Beauty collection here .

I personally love it when someone tells me I smell unbelievably good! Today, I was meeting with possibly the cutest girl ever, Sahar and my sister Mona! They both are those girls who always smell delicious! One of their tips to getting that super amazing smell, which in my opinion is an awesome and easy idea is using scented body oil and mixing it with perfume. I know it sounds elementary, but it works wonders! Mona actually does this all the time, and I swear we get stopped in public places all the time! People always want to know what she‚Äôs wearing! Today Sahar and Mona told me they actually use Vanilla, Coconut or Jasmine scented oil after they get out of the shower. Then add a mist of their favorite perfume for a super unique and delicious scent! Of course mixing it is key, but this is one of the best ways to get your own scents that is not only delicious, but unique to YOU! üôÇ I would recommend mixing some scented oil or essential oil with almond oil to get a super moisturizing boost to your routine! I love this idea!

Please can you explain how exactly do we mix the two? Should we pour the perfume in a separate bottle and mix the oil in that? S hudabeauty Hi darling, don‚Äôt mix them1 You don‚Äôt want to mess with the composition too much, just apply the oil first to your body, then spray the perfume on places like the inner area of your forearms, wrists, neck back and front, and a little on your decolletage Saniya Thanks for the superb idea üôÇ Jimena Ponce Hi huda üôÇ So I have to mix the three olis, and then put up some of my perfum ?

Juksid D Great tips. I have a tip too, for superb smelling hair, have a bath shampoo and condition bla bla, turn over your head and apply a few spritz of perfume or mist on the hair randomly and mix it everywhere on the head using you fingers. Tie up the hair and open when semi dry or fully dry. Fancie This is an excellent idea!

Love you girl! üòâ Sana‚Äô Where would we find vanilla or jasmine scented oils in Kuwait? Would stores like Kiehls have them? Mariam Seriously great idea but I have a question ‚Äì do you literally mix the scented oil with the perfume (as in the bottle) or do you apply the scented oil on you and then spray some perfume? Thanks =) hudabeauty You can do either, but when I mix my essential oils with my body oil, I honestly pour them in and label them! üôÇ Mariam Thanks so much for answering! cecilia Where can I buy the scented oils if I live in the States?? suman great tip üôÇ Alicia Where do you buy essential/scented oils and almond oil?

For some reason companies always like to add heaps of fragrance and chemicals that leave your skin feeling worse than you were without the eye cream! Well, I found one that moisturizes and leaves my skin feeling spectacular! I actually LOOOOOOVE the entire Genifique line from Lancome, as well as the Visionairre serum, but Lancome Genifique Youth Activating Eye Concentrate is seriously awesome! I love it because my skin feels healthy after I use it! It‚Äôs hydrating, but very light and zero greasiness, which means it makes a great base for makeup as well! I know it‚Äôs a youth activating concentrate, but I just love the way it makes my skin feel, so for me this is great at any age! Not surprised that it‚Äôs won almost every beauty award out there! I highly recommend this eye cream! üôÇ beauty health Human skin Lanc√¥me skin Skin Care Mon, 23 Apr 2012 11 Comments Related Posts The Hand Creams That Will Actually Give You Sexy‚Ä¶ Tue, 21 Nov 2017 7 Things I Can‚Äôt Sleep Without Sat, 13 Jan 2018 Ten Skincare Products That Changed My Life Tue, 6 Jun 2017 farahshah hi huda how about kiel‚Äôs avocado eye creme?? which eyecreme u recommend the most between the above two? Sara Can I use it if I‚Äôm 20 years old? loveablemakeup Hm, this post made me very interested in this product‚Ä¶ Its so hard to find the perfect eye cream! I have also heard a lot of good things about one from bobbi brown, something extra repair eye cream I think. Maybe I‚Äôll get both and test:) jojosbeautyguide Lancome has such amazing products!!!! Jeanice Really? That‚Äôs great info Los Lanc√¥me I used to use a lot of their products! I am a firm believer that EVERY woman should always use eye cram! It was a tip my g‚Äôma gave me years ago that she passed down to my 5 aunts and I even have my 13 yr old use it. We have dark circles bad as family trait and anemia but the problem I have are those little white dots under my eyes so if the cream is to heavy one will come up! I‚Äôll get a sample of this! Thanks for the review! Sharan Does it work on fine lines and dark circles for the early 30 something‚Äôs?

So excited about these!!! hudabeauty Thank you darling! I am so glad you are excited! They will hit Sephora US, but much later. If you purchase over 75$ on our site, you get free Lightening Fast Shipping! We use DHL or FedEx so it comes within a 2-3 days after it‚Äôs shipped! Mel I ordered your rose gold palette and liquid matte in spice girl. Was really pleased with them. I spend over $75 dollers on your website so I got free shipping. Unfortunately I was hit by custom charges. Paid ¬£24 to DHL to deliver the item. Such a shame. I wish you would stock all the liquid minis. In either harrods or cultbeauty. To make it easier and affordable for people who live in the UK to purchase your products. I would love to buy all the sets. But because of all the charges involved i would think twice. Thank you. Sabbu Thank you Is there a list of the exact colors in each kit? It‚Äôs not very legible from the photo. Thanks boo! ‚ù§Ô∏è Chand Hi! when will you be launching the red kit on Cult Beauty?

I think they will only be available in Sephora Dubai Mall until January! Pavitra Hey huda ! Will you be launching tgese in USA and by when because i am here only till 15th ! Should i wait for these or shop the huda contour kits ? Tia love u loads ‚ù§Ô∏è hudabeauty I LOVE the Contour Kits, I just love the Lip Contour so much, I use it every day and more than I actually use the Liquid Matte. Personally, they both have different perks so it depends on what you want Contour Kit: Two liquid Mattes, plus Lip Contour and a great price (good for trying the brand for the first time maybe) Mini Kit: 4 Liquid Mattes, really great for trying new colors</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>Our New Mini Kits + Two New Shades!!</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>2016-12-04 00:00:00</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>3ce7-4506-aac4</string></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>2e710541ba990c8a7b26ea889e07b5198e00ebbc</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Author</name><value><array><data><value><string>hudabeauty</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>http://hudabeauty.com/2010/08/22/hot-or-not-kims-new-bangs/</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>CELEBRITY | HAIR NEWS By Huda Heidi Kattan Kim Kardashian recently donned a new do, showing off some pretty soft, long bangs.

So when she started talking to me about a face cream that she could not live without, I thought, it must REALLY good if she‚Äôs recommending it to me. Her skin did look amazing and unbelievably even, so I thought why not, let‚Äôs try it! Now the cream is pretty phenomenal, it‚Äôs actually made out of Gems (hence the name, Gemology) and works to provide missing elements our body needs. It actually makes sense, for instance, skin (our largest organ) needs just the tiniest amount of carbon to be healthy and beautiful, but it rarely gets the nutrients. This cream basically gives your skin whatever elements it‚Äôs missing (it‚Äôs all science, but it completely makes sense). After doing a little research I found this was one of the celebrity beauty secrets, and after using it for only a few days I understand why! This cream is my CURE ALL! I loooooove it to say the least! I am undoubdtely a cusomter for life! This cream is INSANE! It has made my skin soooo soft, completely even toned (to the point where I have been wearing less foundation) and it cured my acne. It‚Äôs unreal! Usually if I fall asleep without washing my face, I breakout the next day. I was so tired last week from planning my party, I feel asleep 3 times without washing my face (2 days were back to back), and you know what NO BREAKOUT! I have no been using this product for three weeks, and I am obsessed! My skin is so firm and just beautiful. It really does give your skin whatever it is missing! I UNBELIEVABLY HIGHLY recommend this, like it‚Äôs a MUST! I have tried it all, from Placenta cream (which was also very nice), natural, unnatural, everything, La Prarie, LaMer, your drugstore brand, your hidden celeb secret brand imported from all over the world and NOTHING has worked like this! I have nothing bad to say about it except, wait about 3 days before you expect any results. The results might not be so obvious right away, but after a week or so, you should notice your skin tone evening out and the elasticity improving. If you have acne, you will probably notice it helps cure the acne as well. This is a MUST ladies!! For more information call 050 749 1732, tell them HudaBeauty referred you for a consultation on what Gem is best for your skin type. You will love me for this! image credits bforyou beauty Makeup product skin Wed, 18 May 2011 21 Comments Related Posts If You Have Body Acne, You Need To Try This!

Soon there won‚Äôt be a brand that doesn‚Äôt have a unicorn beauty product because frankly, we‚Äôre all OBSESSED! But of course we are, what‚Äôs not to love about glitter, pretty pastel colors, holographic makeup, and rainbows? There‚Äôs literally nothing that hasn‚Äôt been unicornified: whether you want unicorn essence, (Farsali‚Äôs pink, glittery antioxidant essence, which looks and smells pretty damn magical), unicorn tears, (Too Faced‚Äôs holographic cream lipstick), unicorn horns (makeup brushes by almost everyone), or unicorn lashes (that‚Äôs actually a brand!), you can find it. BTW you can even get unicorn snot, AKA glitter gel ‚Äì duh! It‚Äôs almost as if we actually believe, that by some magical unicorn power, that maybe, just maybe there is some unicorn ingredient in these products somewhere ‚Äì we can keep secretly hoping! But seriously, why is everyone going mad for unicorns? Other than they‚Äôre magical AF! Today, Instagram is the social media phenomenon everyone is infatuated with ‚Äì it‚Äôs a visual platform that has proved to be a marketing hotspot for brands. This goes hand in hand with the unicorn trend; as the platform dominates, brands are having to keep up with striking imagery that will grab you mid scroll‚Ä¶ and unicorn makeup does that! It‚Äôs pretty, it‚Äôs sparkly, it‚Äôs bright, different, and majestic! After all, gold-horned makeup brushes are far more likely to warrant a double tap than your standard set of black makeup brushes. And as shoppers, we‚Äôve always been obsessed with packaging, it‚Äôs almost as sacred as the product itself ‚Äì so when you see a bomb sparkling, unicorn package you‚Äôre hooked! And it‚Äôs a bit different too: natural glowing skin is all good and fun for the daytime, but for the weekends, who doesn‚Äôt want to strobe their face and let loose with a rainbow highlighter or holographic lip strobe ? So, right about now we‚Äôre guessing the urge to unicornify has overcome you ‚Äì well we‚Äôve got your shimmery back! Make an easy DIY unicorn glow and add glitter to your favorite body oil, moisturizer, or even suncream (a little goes a long way)! On that note, we CAN NOT wait to try Frank Body‚Äôs Shimmer Scrub , stay tuned for the review! makeup trend unicorn makeup unicorns Sat, 20 May 2017 1 Comment Related Posts DIY Unicorn Rainbow Highlighter!

So, we got them to share with us what‚Äôs hot at Cult Beauty right now‚Ä¶ The Vamp Stamp ‚Äì VaVaVoom Stamp , $29: If there‚Äôs one thing that gets to all of us, it‚Äôs perfecting winged liner. Apparently, in just one quick stamp, this eyeliner wing tool might just be the answer to the flawless cat eye we‚Äôve all been looking for, at last! (Stay tuned for our review). Zoeva ‚Äì Rose Gold Brush Set ‚Äì Volume 3 , $96: Huda‚Äôs been a long-time fan of Zoeva brushes, so we can only imagine the latest edition is not only going to look stunning on your makeup dresser, but you‚Äôll also be blending and applying your makeup seamlessly too. Sunday Riley ‚Äì Good Genes , $110: An all-in-one anti-ageing beauty elixir? You‚Äôve got our attention! This multi-purpose super serum reportedly boasts a fan club including Helen Mirren and Jourdan Dunn ‚Äì this daily facial-in-a-bottle almost sounds too good to be true! Sol de Janiro ‚Äì Brazilian Bum Bum Cream , $23: Summer‚Äôs here, and this butt-lifting cream could not have come at a better time. Our bum bums are definitely ready to be lifted by this circulation boosting, skin firming, cellulite diminishing cream‚Äì we think miracle is an accurate description! Plus, it smells ahhhmazing! (We‚Äôll be putting this to the test!) Ouai ‚Äì Wave Spray , $13: Of course hair guru Jen Atkin‚Äôs hair products are on the list ‚Äì and it would come as no surprise if the bulk of the order came from Huda, she‚Äôs obsessed! Smelling as good as perfume, this wave creating hair mist is like the beach in a bottle. Alpha H ‚Äì Liquid Gold , $43: We love the sound of overnight skin regeneration‚Ä¶ What‚Äôs that? A collagen enhancing, sleep-in liquid peel? Sounds like the perfect skin fix for busy girls! We haven‚Äôt got time to be dealing with fine lines, large pores, blackheads, scars, blemishes, and pigmentation ‚Äì but Liquid Gold does. Becca ‚Äì Shimmering Skin Perfector in Prismatic Amethyst , $41: A luminous sheen is almost a uniform at Huda Beauty HQ, and we love that Becca‚Äôs unicorn-esque purple shimmering highlighter puts us in full 2017 highlight swing. Vintner‚Äôs Daughter ‚Äì Active Botanical Serum , $225: If skin care is as important to you as it is for us, this might just become your new obsession.

If you‚Äôre following me on snap, you may have already seen how obsessed I am with everything in the the new limited-edition beauty box I did with Cult Beauty ! I was so particular about what was included in the box and personally handpicked each and every item. I hope you love them as much as I do! Here‚Äôs a closer look at all the products! Roll over each item to read more about why I love it! 1. Morphe Brushes The Blushed Blush Palette 9B ‚Äì It‚Äôs so hard to find a good blush palette, and few come close to this selection of nine buttery pinks, peaches, and natural flush tones. The colors are just perfection! It truly has something for everyone. 2. Huda Beauty Samantha #7 lashes ‚Äì These are one of my favorite pairs of lashes! It‚Äôs actually the first hand-designed pair I‚Äôve ever made. I always tell people who are indecisive that when it comes to choosing a false lash, you can‚Äôt go wrong with this style. They look incredible on everyone and are ideal for any occasion. 3. Kevyn Aucoin The Sculpting Powder in Medium ‚Äì This is one of my favorite powders for contouring the nose and jawline. It has this greyish tone that mimics a natural shadow, and is super easy to blend, so I‚Äôm always selfie-ready! 4. Tata Harper Resurfacing Mask (half size) ‚Äì Anyone who follows me will know how much I love a good face mask, and I‚Äôm obsessed with this one! It smells like roses! It‚Äôs the perfect pick-me-up, especially before a big event. My face literally glows after I use it! 5. iBeauty Skin Brush 21 ‚Äì I love that this brush gives you that airbrushed look by packing on makeup really well without looking like you‚Äôre wearing too much. 6. Yu Ling Jade Small Roller ‚Äì How adorable is this? It‚Äôs like a mini work out for your facial muscles. I love that it helps to improve the contours of your face. 7. Sunday Riley Ceramic Slip Cleanser ‚Äì This clay-based formula literally cleans our your pores. For someone like me who is constantly experimenting with makeup, I need a heavy-duty cleanser like this one that dissolves every last trace of the day without stripping my skin. It just pulls all the dirt out! The box will be available on September 29th with everything you see here!

Today‚Äôs a little travel edition ‚Äî these are the products that didn‚Äôt leave my side on a recent trip to LA! Point your mouse over each product to learn why I love them! 1. Guerlain Orchid√©e Imp√©riale The Longevity Concentrate ‚Äì One of my favorite concentrates to make skin look really radiant. It‚Äôs that secret product you use before a big event. It just makes your skin glow, and gives you this intense hydration that doesn‚Äôt break you out. I‚Äôve been using it for several years now. Even my husband uses it! 6. SkinCeuticals Body Texturizing Treatment ‚Äì This is one of those products people don‚Äôt really think about using, but it‚Äôs incredible. It‚Äôs one of my favorite body products. I have very dry skin, and when people have dry skin like me, it‚Äôs not so soft to touch. This helps keep skin smooth and soft by helping it exfoliate naturally. When I get out of the bath, I apply a little bit of oil then this on top. My skin feels much more touchable and evenly pigmented. I use it all over‚Äîmy legs, arms, and a little on my d√©collet√©. 5. Cinema Secrets Makeup Brush Cleanser ‚Äì I love Cinema Secrets Makeup Brush Cleaner because it dries so quickly. It‚Äôs really great to use between clients and models, or when I‚Äôm on a shoot, between, even YouTube videos. I feel like it cleans my brushes for a basic clean. For a more intense clean of course, I‚Äôd use a proper brush cleaner. But on days I‚Äôm shooting and have models here, I make sure I have this handy. It has enough alcohol to get rid of the bacteria. 2. Collyre Bleu Eye Drops ‚Äì This helps to make the whites of your eyes whiter. Like super white‚Äì it almost gives it a blue tint that makes them look really healthy. One of my colleagues brought this back for me in Paris. It used to only be available in France but now it‚Äôs available in the U.S. too ‚Äì I even spotted it in LA. If you wear contacts or on a photo shoot, and your eyes are tired or even have this yellow-tinge to them, this helps make them super bright. 4. Sunday Riley Luna Sleeping Night Oil ‚Äì I wasn‚Äôt blessed with good skin at all, but I know how to take care of it. I‚Äôm just obsessed with Sunday Riley‚Äôs Luna. It‚Äôs my Holy Grail product‚Ä¶my favorite of all time! It gets rid of visible pores, and has a little bit of retinol so it improves the texture of skin. I use it only before bed ‚Äì you can‚Äôt use it during the day because it has retinol in it so sun exposure could irritate your skin if you wear it during the day time. 3. Oribe Surfcomber Tousled Texture Mousse ‚Äì The Surfcomber is so amazing because when you apply it to your roots, it gives you this stickiness that I can‚Äôt say is necessarily the nicest feeling‚Ä¶but the body it give your hair is insane! I know this sounds weird, but I think I have a particularly small head so it gives my hair a lot of volume which I need! I ONLY apply it on my roots. If you want, you can apply it all over, but keep in mind it‚Äôs a texturizer so your hair might feel a little sticky all over if you do.

The other day, I was amazed at how many articles I was able to find saying that Aloe Vera is a huge promoter of hair growth. The enzymes in Aloe Vera, when applied to your scalp, lead to hair growth over time! Wanting to test this theory, I tried using a recipe I found, mixing 3 parts Aloe Vera with 1 part honey. I applied it to my scalp and left it for about 25 minutes before washing off. Ok, It definitely felt really nice on my scalp, and I noticed after about a month and half of using this once a week, I did notice a difference in my hair growth, but I was really amazed to see many new baby hairs growing! I was pretty amazed, which is why I recommend this for both men and women!! I also love the way my scalp feels when I sue this mixture! I recommend using less honey, though. I recommend 1/2 cup Aloe Vera gel (pure) with 2 tablespoons honey, that seems to work better. Only apply the mixture to your scalp! I‚Äôm going to continue doing this once a week, I love it so far!! beauty Natural Beauty Tip Wed, 8 Jun 2011 29 Comments Related Posts We‚Äôre Buying An Aloe Vera Plant Right Now!

In case you‚Äôve seen most of these celebrity beauty ads, you‚Äôve noticed the celebs look about 10+ years younger. I‚Äôll admit, I wouldn‚Äôt mind a few touches here and there, just to get rid of maybe a unpredictable breakout or something, but I guess since their at it they can erase anything that seems to reflect my age as well! NOT! This ad of Kate Winslet for Lancome‚Äôs New Lipsticks L‚ÄôAbsolu Nu looks gorgeous, but they really received a lot of press about going crazy with the photoshop. What do you guys think? Do you prefer ads more natural, or do you like this picture perfect look? image credits sassisamblog, zimbio celebrity Kate Winslet Lanc√¥me photoshop Sun, 13 Mar 2011 13 Comments Related Posts THE Most Magical Airbrush Apps For Flawless Selfies Sat, 22 Apr 2017 If You Want To Look Like These Celebs At 50, This Is‚Ä¶ Wed, 4 Oct 2017 Ladies: Here‚Äôs How You Should Be Shaving Your Face! Mon, 22 Aug 2016 goldenpast She obviously looks MUCH younger in the ad. Maybe it‚Äôs just me‚Ä¶ BUT I agree. They went overboard. However, I don‚Äôt know why people are continuously surprised about ad‚Äôs being excessively photoshopped‚Ä¶ Every ad in a magazine is photoshopped to the MAX! ‚Ä¶ And it‚Äôs not like anybody‚Äôs going to stop them. And even if people were able to get their attention.. chances are they‚Äôll STILL photoshop as many pictures as they want. That‚Äôs just how it works. If you want to look younger when you‚Äôre 50. Just eat healthy and workout. Take care of yourself. That‚Äôs my logic. Mary Monroe I‚Äôd like to see pictures that are more natural, maybe with a little touch up‚Ä¶ but over doing it, creates a perfect and unrealistic look. Hollywood is all about that, sad to say that probably won‚Äôt change. Women can‚Äôt feel comfortable with their true beauty and are forced to have to look perfect all the time, which is wrong! Renren ALSO! completely unrelated‚Ä¶but Huda someone‚Äôs in Grazia magazine! e7em, you! hehehe hudabeauty haha:) You found me?! üôÇ Renren yes! reviewing fashion like only a true fashionista could! hehe hudabeauty OMG! üôÇ Hahaha, thank you baby!! You‚Äôre so cute!! Renren she still looks pretty young in the none photoshopped pic so i don‚Äôt know why i don‚Äôt think they over-photoshopped her. In the picture below her skin is so smooth and glowing as well except she‚Äôs smiling. the photoshop is unnecessary. bear in mind, though, that alot of celebrities also are against their faces being photoshopped to perfection. imagine how you would feel if someone takes a pic of you then erases half of your face and changes your face shape till it‚Äôs perfect‚Ä¶.would make me VERY self conscious about my looks Sofie ‚Äúour perception of beauty is distorted‚Äù, i love the Dove commercial that shows the reality of how the above pictures are created http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XEHpyQbwM0 hudabeauty Ahhh!! LOVE this!! i actually did some work with Dove when they released this campaign in the states! Love it!!! AlReem wow she looks very different Photoshop is great as long as you know about it and are educated that people you see in the magazines don‚Äôt really look like that. We might know how much of a powerful tool Photoshop is but what about the young girls who haven‚Äôt got a clue about it and who view these celebrities as ‚Äòperfect goddesses‚Äô and aspire to be like them and have those unattainable measures? I think the more awareness we spread about it the more we help those young girls grow to be strong women instead weak ones with shattered self esteems. kaval A few touches here and there is fine. But in this ad Kate‚Äôs skin looks flawless without any kind of lines or wrinkles and what so ever. When in reality she does have wrinkles around her eye area. I don‚Äôt think that they should go so overboard with the photoshop. PS: Huda darling I have been following your recommended tomato regime religiously and my skin is nothing short of glowing. All my pimple marks have lightened and i always have this glow on my face. Thank you!! Absolutely love your blog. üôÇ Sheila It‚Äôs just to much all of these girls never look like real women, they need to make them look like real people! Tata I am so against it‚Ä¶Its fake and fake stuff makes me angry‚Ä¶to be honest I don find it attractive at all, I am overwhelmed by the brightness of the picture‚Ä¶The other point is that I always question myself why they don go this far in photoshopping pictures of male celebrities like George Clooney? Instead they try to show it to be more attractive? Women are not objects, and photoshopping a picture to this extent is nothing but treating this actress as an object! I feel sorry for her to allow for this insult and mistreatment‚Ä¶I think the only authority who can put a stop to this is US, WOMEN!</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>Celebrities Never Age!</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>2011-03-13 00:00:00</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>3ce7-4506-aac4</string></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>5146b8bf2a436709f0cedfdd4fbf8b91ade5dfb0</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Author</name><value><array><data><value><string>HB Team</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>http://hudabeauty.com/2017/04/07/hb-love-our-3d-highlighter-palette-on-different-skin-tones/</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>Thank you SO much to Laura Capon (as well as Alex and Shyvonne) from Cosmopolitan UK for testing our Huda Beauty 3D Highlighter Palette!

Next I use the Slant Tweezer to clean up around my brows and then the Mini Slant Tweezer to get the very small, hard to reach hairs. Lastly I used the Spoolie to brush my brows up then with the Brow Shaping Scissors I trim the small hairs that stick out.

After such an amazing response to our Pink Sands and Golden Sands 3D Highlighter palettes last year, we had tons of requests for another edition with deeper shades that would give the most insane highlight on tanned and richer skin tones. So because we can never have too many, we had to create the Huda Beauty 3D Bronze Sands edition. It has four stunning new shades to perfectly complement tanned and rich skin tones for emphasizing cheekbones and collarbones, lifting the brow bone, and adding a little shoulder bling to your look. Our signature Melted Strobe formula in a divine, rich gold is the perfect base for layering our three bronze and copper toned powders so you‚Äôre glowing like a bronzed goddess. The Bronze Sands 3D Highlighter Palette launches online next month (February) with all our online retailers, globally.

First, I think it‚Äôs important that I express to you all how much I love blush, like seriously LOVE blush! To me, it adds warmth to a look and if I leave the house it‚Äôs one of my staples, no matter where I‚Äôm going‚Äìgrocery store, to an event, running errands‚Äìit‚Äôs a must! Not only does it add a healthy glow to your face, but it also helps contour your cheeks and blend in any contouring that you might have done. Soooo after trying a million and one blushers, I finally found one that can‚Äôt be beat! I am IN LOVE with the Illamasqua Blusher in Hussy! It‚Äôs got that perfect marriage of pink or peach that goes with almost every look and the pigment is amazing! I also love that it looks like a natural flush so it also makes you look naturally gorgeous! It looks amazing on all my clients, models, and my sisters love it as well! No matter what your skin tone, this is the perfect blush! It‚Äôs without doubt my #1 blush of the moment that I simply cannot live without! If I need extra staying power, I pair it up with the Makeup Forever HD Blush for all day wearability! This can be purchased in the UAE at Bloomindales Dubai Mall or online at Sephora.com or Illamasqua.com image credits examiner beauty Makeup Mon, 4 Jul 2011 12 Comments Related Posts Beauty Glossary: Draping Mon, 3 Oct 2016 The Collection Which Left Us S-Peach-Less!

You‚Äôre always posting great products (some of which I go and buy as soon as I get the chance) but I find that you almost NEVER say WHERE we can buy them!! I‚Äôve been running around trying to find the L‚ÄôOreal Voluminous mascara in Carbon Black that you did a post on a few weeks ago..and have had no luck. While you‚Äôre doing a great favor to people and brands by posting ur insights on their products, you‚Äôre not helping us much by not telling us where to get them! On almost every post i see people asking ‚ÄùWhere can I find it?‚Äù So juuuust to save you the headache of us harassing you, pleaase put where we can find it‚Ä¶otherwise, the post is kind of useless! And i‚Äôm running out of blush, and in need of something new‚Ä¶.but dont know where this one can be found! x hudabeauty OMG!!! I somehow always forget that, but I will make sure I try my best to remember to always include that! üôÇ I added in the body of the post so hope you get this in time! You will love it!!! üôÇ MariamSRE ‚ô• You rock, thanks! We love you! Shaikha Where can I find this brand?? Mai Illamasqua is becomin one of my favourite brands! Their blushes by far beat MAC blushes! Much more pigmented! Check out their cream blush in Dixie &amp; Rude.. They‚Äôre amazing! I also love their lippies! R120 Hi Huda, I‚Äôm going to try this blush. It sounds a bit like Nars Orgasm. My friend is with me looking @ ur site and she tells me to tell you that she likes ur blog but feels that michelle phan‚Äôs videos are better bc she has music. I, personally don‚Äôt care abt that but thought I‚Äôd let you know.Xoxo Attia I respect her what ur friend says but i totally disagree with that, I have seen Michelle Phan‚Äôs videos a lot. No doubt she is amazing MUA but she lacks sensuality and sexuality which Huda has MASHALLAH. 2nd thing Huda speaks very well while doing tutorial but Michelle has recorded voice in her tutorials, I like way much to Marlena than Michelle Phan but there is no comparision of HUDA in this whole world. Her sincerity, the way she explains things and love to her followers is incredible. Power power to you Huda. &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 If i get chance in my life to fulfill my dream to become a MUA, I will definitely first of all assist Huda InshAllah hudabeauty I love you Attia&lt;3 Everyone has an opinion, I like Michelle Phan's videos, but I find the music sometimes distracting that's why I no longer use it in the background! But thanks for the input R120! Xxx Attia Im sorry R120, if I was rude, i dint meant to offend ya. I just expressed myself @ HUDA, when it comes to you i become partial, my love for u makes me so. lol &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>My Favorite Blush of the Moment!</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>2011-07-04 00:00:00</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>3ce7-4506-aac4</string></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>788c2c326f6d20b1a0b2c54b568d5eed79c0c74d</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Author</name><value><array><data><value><string>HB Team</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>http://hudabeauty.com/2017/06/20/hudas-beauties-we-cant-stop-watching-these-strobe-swatches/</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>A post shared by Huda Kattan (@hudabeauty) on Jun 18, 2017 at 6:23am PDT OMGGGG!

I want to know!! A post shared by Huda Kattan (@hudabeauty) on Mar 1, 2017 at 1:21am PST Hey My Loves!! So I cannot believe that I finally get to show &amp; tell you guys about our new Huda Beauty 3D Highlighter ! We have been working on this for almost 18 months, and I must admit ‚Äì I was SUPER anxious to reveal it today on Social Media!! I‚Äôve literally been dying to share this with you guys! Before I jump straight into the palette, I wanted to tell you guys a bit more about the inspiration behind this palette. So we all know that highlighters are super major right now, and I‚Äôve seen loads of stunning ones on the market which I absolutely love! I really wanted to launch a Highlighter Palette, but I promised myself I wouldn‚Äôt launch anything unless it was revolutionary. If we were going to create a highlighter, it had to push boundaries. I wanted to change the highlighter game forever and take things to the next level! Although I love wearing highlighters, I often notice that it magnifies my already large pores. That‚Äôs where the first inspiration came about with the Melted Strobe . It‚Äôs a pearlescent, creamy base enriched with shea butter to create a smooth canvas for makeup application. You guys might remember my coconut oil hack where I apply coconut oil before applying my powder highlight ‚Äì who would‚Äôve known that that hack inspired this formula! I always did this because layering beauty oil with powder highlights made my cheeks pop from miles away. What I love about the Melted Strobe is that it really helps boost the highlight because it amplifies the glow and it‚Äôs great to wear layered, or on its own. Huda Beauty 3D Highlighter: Pink Sands Edition Another goal I had was to make highlighting like a pro within each person‚Äôs grasp using our unique formula &amp; technique (which you‚Äôll see instructed on the palette to help guide you!). The technique is super special because that is what creates dimension on your cheeks and blends your highlight perfectly. Every single color in this palette is so important and although our palette may look like a normal highlighter at first glance, it definitely is not. Incase you didn‚Äôt catch the how-to on my Insta-Story or Snap; here‚Äôs the 4-step technique to create the ultimate 3D cheek glow: 1. Prep: Apply the Melted Strobe as a base to smooth the skin and amplify the light reflecting pearls. 2. Set: Dab the lightest highlight from cheek to temple to set and bring out the pop. 3. Sculpt: Apply the darker shade under cheekbones to add dimension and shape. 4. Flush: Sweep the rosy highlight on the apples of your cheeks for a healthy glow. Huda Beauty 3D Highlighter: Golden Sands Edition I really wanted to create an all-in-one cheek palette for everyone! The Huda Beauty 3D Highlighter comes in two editions ‚Äì the Pink Sands Palette is ideal for fair to medium skin tones, and the Golden Sands Palette we developed for medium to dark skin tones. The name inspo for these palettes also have a special story to it‚Ä¶but I‚Äôll tell you guys that another day. üôÇ Let me know what you guys think of this palette! I‚Äôd loooove to hear your comments! This was such a huge project and I‚Äôm just so happy I was able to share this with you guys. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è Thank you so much for all your love &amp; support, you guys are amazing!!! Oh yes ‚Äì I almost forgot to mention!! The Huda Beauty 3D Highlighter launches mid-April on shophudabeauty.com .

My brushes, and of course my beauty blender, are my essential tools‚Ä¶ But if there‚Äôs one very important lesson I‚Äôve learned in my many years as an MUA, it‚Äôs that dirty brushes will get you nowhere! Not only can makeup brushes harbor oil, dirt, and bacteria from your face that can lead to breakouts, but the old makeup trapped on your brush won‚Äôt give you the flawless application you could get from clean makeup brushes, particularly with your powders. In an ideal world, makeup brushes should be cleaned after every use, especially foundation brushes, but a more realistic expectation is once a week. You can use an instant brush cleaner in between washing ‚Äì I LOVE the Cinema Secrets Makeup Brush Cleaner , it‚Äôs really easy to use and dissolves all your makeup and purifies the brush. Your makeup sponge really should be cleaned after every use: I usually do it just before I‚Äôm about to use it, that way it‚Äôs clean and damp and ready to be used ‚Äì check out my tips here . It‚Äôs weird, but if you‚Äôre anything like me you‚Äôll actually find the process of cleaning your makeup brushes really relaxing and SO satisfying ‚Äì I love watching as all the makeup washes away and having them all clean and organized. A post shared by Huda Kattan (@hudabeauty) on Aug 19, 2017 at 1:30am PDT It might seem a bit extra, but this is the way I clean and store ALL my makeup brushes ‚Äì I have hundreds ‚Äì it‚Äôs really worth it if you want your makeup brushes to last, especially if you‚Äôve spent a lot of money on them! I use the Sigma Spa Brush Cleaning Mat ‚Äì it‚Äôs ahhhhmazing, and you can just put it straight in your sink ‚Äì and the Sephora Solid Brush Cleaner , which is so convenient. You can also use baby shampoo, or even just a bar of soap. Once the brushes are all shiny and new again, leave them on a clean towel to dry completely. After, I use my brush cleanser to ensure they‚Äôre sanitized, and then I store them with makeup brush guards to protect the bristles and preserve the shape ‚Äì they‚Äôre also brilliant for traveling. Finally, the best advice I can give you is to be gentle. It might seem like vigorously washing your brush will clean it better or by rubbing the bristles on a towel will get it dry quicker, but the rougher you are with your brush, the more damage you‚Äôre doing. Over time this will wreck the brush and the way it distributes your products, so it‚Äôs better to be careful. I get SO attached to some of my brushes, and I‚Äôve had some for years and years, so I really do treat them like my babies! cleaning brushes how to clean makeup brushes makeup brushes Sat, 19 Aug 2017 13 Comments Related Posts I Discovered THE Most Magical Drugstore Product in London Sun, 11 Jun 2017 Should You Buy These Weird Brushes?

But where does it stand in the spectrum of eyebrow needs? Here‚Äôs what we thought: What it is: A waxy, tinted brow gel housed in a sleek mini, black compact. What it does: With the help of a brow brush, waxy pigmented gel can easily help fill in sparse areas of the brows. What we loved: True to the Bobbi Brown spirit, this is best for a more natural approach to brows. The combo of pigment and beeswax helps achieve a natural, fuller look. It feels a bit like pomade for brows. We found it‚Äôs best for filling in sparse areas of the brows without looking like overkill. The color range (17 total) are also very close to natural hair colors (we love Saddle for brunettes) and shades for highlights to give hair the look of texture. What we didn‚Äôt like: While great for filling in brows, because of its waxy nature, it‚Äôs not the best for buildable, detailed work (such as defined strokes mimicking the look of natural hairs). A good pick if you‚Äôre looking for a little more volume with a more natural approach to brows. Also note, while it is water-, sweat-, and humidity- resistant, it can still rub off by mistake.

I picked up an interesting product from Korea recently: a peel off brow tint. It‚Äôs exactly what it sounds like‚Ä¶you use something that looks like a mascara wand to apply the dark gel to your eyebrows where you want it darker.

I actually am COMPLETELY one of those girls who takes a good amount of time doing my makeup (I will take as long as I have! If it‚Äôs 20 minutes to 2 hours!) and expects it to stay alllll day long! Other than my lips, I really don‚Äôt like readjusting my makeup throughout the day, so of course I am constantly looking for makeup that lasts as long as possible! I had a small baby shower on Thursday and I applied my makeup at noon that day, I couldn‚Äôt believe it, but my makeup stayed perfectly (aside from lips) without any retouching till 2 AM. What I was most impressed with was my blush! Ok, here‚Äôs the deal, I have been on a serious search for the best cream blush that (1) had the best blending texture, (2) the best pigment, and (3) lasts all day. I am so happy to say I really believe I have found it! I tested soooo many brands and this one just met all of my requirements! The Makeup Forever HD Creme Blush (I looooove #6) is AhhMAZING! I applied my makeup, contour, highlight, etc, then ever-so-lightly (I mean this) pressed the pump to get a tiny amount on my fingers. I then used my fingers to apply the blush very lightly. I like to follow with a powder blush for extra staying power, I used Illamasqua blusher in Hussy. I couldn‚Äôt believe how perfect my makeup stayed for over 12 hours! The photo above was after about 10 hours, I am completely exhausted, but my makeup is still in place! üôÇ image credits makeupgeek , indyabeauty beauty Makeup Sat, 18 Jun 2011 16 Comments Related Posts Beauty Glossary: Draping Mon, 3 Oct 2016 The BEST (And Cheapest) Drugstore Setting Powder‚Ä¶ Tue, 2 Jan 2018 Is Urban Decay‚Äôs All Nighter Setting Spray Worth the Hype?

I‚Äôm currently using Laura Mercier‚Äôs Secret Camouflage and it seems to wear after hour #3 giving me a very sickly look esp under my eyes. So I use YSL‚Äôs Touche Eclat to touch up. hudabeauty Hi darling!! I actually don‚Äôt like the Laura Mercier Secret Camouflage as much as the hype that‚Äôs built around it simply for the fact that it doesn‚Äôt stay for me! The best concealer I have found that lasts all day, but is soooo hard to find (especially in Dubai) is the Lise Watier Concealer wheel. It is really dry, but it gives great coverage so you don‚Äôt need to apply too much and it lasts through everything! I think you might be able to find it on Amazon.com, but honestly I got it a long time ago and I am having trouble finding another one! They have it at Naimies.com (they are almost always sold out of it) but they don‚Äôt deliver here, if you have anyone in the states, ask them to send it to you! Another option is the Giorgio Armani Under Eye Concealer which is quite good at staying all day, but I recommend you mix it with a tiny amount of your foundation to get the perfect match!

Naturally, we take the final step in our makeup routine very seriously, especially when we‚Äôre counting on it lasting all day. Urban Decay‚Äôs All Nighter has been a cult favorite to set makeup, but is it worth the hype? What it is: A makeup setting spray. What it does: This setting spray is said to actually lower the temperature of your makeup to keep your makeup looking smooth in humid or cold conditions without settling in lines or caking for at 16 hours. What we liked: It‚Äôs not really a spray as much as it is an even mist. Your skin with be lightly dewy as it sets and then it gives a nice, even sheen to your makeup. And our makeup actually does last a lot longer when we use this. Also one of our favorites to use after a good baking session . What we didn‚Äôt like: Aside from some occasional oil slick on our forehead and T-zone area, not much. The price tag is a little steep but considering it‚Äôs also around how much full size makeup setting sprays run, it‚Äôs worth the investment. Our advice: go light and let it dry first before layering too much, or you might risk running your makeup. Best for dry to combination skin types.

There‚Äôs a color for every occasion and every mood ‚Äì right now we‚Äôre feeling sassy in their siren red No. 54, but we like Bound‚Äôs muted mauve for every day (it wouldn‚Äôt be Nars if the names weren‚Äôt provocative). (Above, top to bottom: Swatches in Unlaced, No. 54, Playpen, and Bound) What we didn‚Äôt like : You might have to put more than one coat to get an even finish for some of the colors, which is normal for a lot of lip products. It lasts for a few hours (longer than most glosses), but don‚Äôt expect it to stay put when you drink your morning cup of coffee ‚Äì it‚Äôs not supposed to be liquid matte lipstick, after all. Other than that, not much‚Ä¶it‚Äôs found a happy place in our makeup bag.

Naturally, we take the final step in our makeup routine very seriously, especially when we‚Äôre counting on it lasting all day. Urban Decay‚Äôs All Nighter has been a cult favorite to set makeup, but is it worth the hype? What it is: A makeup setting spray. What it does: This setting spray is said to actually lower the temperature of your makeup to keep your makeup looking smooth in humid or cold conditions without settling in lines or caking for at 16 hours. What we liked: It‚Äôs not really a spray as much as it is an even mist. Your skin with be lightly dewy as it sets and then it gives a nice, even sheen to your makeup. And our makeup actually does last a lot longer when we use this. Also one of our favorites to use after a good baking session . What we didn‚Äôt like: Aside from some occasional oil slick on our forehead and T-zone area, not much. The price tag is a little steep but considering it‚Äôs also around how much full size makeup setting sprays run, it‚Äôs worth the investment. Our advice: go light and let it dry first before layering too much, or you might risk running your makeup. Best for dry to combination skin types.

Yep, apple cider vinegar is one of nature‚Äôs most potent creations, full of active ingredients, vitamins, mineral salts and amino acids. Its magical properties as an antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and antifungal, have been used in medicine for thousands of years, and it‚Äôs now a staple skincare supplement in my beauty regime. APPLE CIDER VINEGAR: Banish acne and fade age spots: The malic acid found in apple cider vinegar makes it a potent antibacterial and antifungal substance that kills bacteria and prevents pimples from popping up. It also removes excess oil from your skin, balances your PH levels, and over time works to draw out toxins from your skin for a glowing complexion. It also works wonders on age spots and acne scars, as the alpha hydroxy acids penetrate deep into the skin, removing dead skin cells. Try washing your skin a few times a week with one part apple cider vinegar and one part distilled water, or create a toner with the same solution. For age spots, apply the vinegar directly, rinsing with warm water after 30 minutes ‚Äì repeat every day for results within six weeks. Whiten teeth: Say adios to stains and rub apple cider vinegar directly on your teeth before rinsing with water. Or, try mixing one teaspoon of apple cider vinegar with a cup of water for a homemade mouthwash, which also kills bacteria that cause bad breath. Avoid doing it daily as it can break down tooth enamel. Get glossy hair: Get the Pinterest mane of your dreams and use apple cider vinegar to cleanse your hair. It‚Äôs awesome clarifying properties remove excess buildup from products and seals the hair cuticle. Check out my video on how I use it as a rinse after washing hair. Dry scalp? With natural antifungal properties, it will restore your skin‚Äôs natural PH balance and destroy dandruff by killing fungus and cleaning clogged pores and hair follicles. Try rubbing a solution of equal parts of cider vinegar with water, and a few drops of tea tree oil, onto your scalp for 5 minutes, and let it sit for 15 minutes before rinsing and shampooing as usual. Say bye bye wrinkles: Apple cider vinegar also hydrates skin and will minimize the appearance of fine lines. Make a mask with equal parts of honey and apple cider vinegar and leave it on your skin for up to 20 minutes, then rinse with warm water. Or, soak a cotton pad in diluted apple cider vinegar and dab it on your skin. After ten minutes rinse with warm water and pat dry. Soothe sunburn: When your glow is veering more towards a tomato tint, add two cups of apple cider vinegar to your bath and soak for ten minutes. It will restore your skin‚Äôs PH balance, soothe your skin, and get rid of the burning sensation. Be careful always to dilute apple cider vinegar, as it‚Äôs a strong substance that can irritate or dry sensitive skin, and remember, you need to buy organic, raw, unfiltered Apple Cider Vinegar ‚Äì otherwise all the magical enzymes will be lost during the filtering process.

To me, I always look for several factors, but most importantly I like one that removes all my dead skin and leaves my skin silky soft! I always try scrubbing again afterwards, and if there is any dead skin left, I know it‚Äôs time to toss the scrub (or in some cases, give to your sisters:) A scrub I have been using for quite some time now (it use to be called Ocean Salt and was slightly different) and I have to say I completely love it, is the Lush Rub Rub Rub bath scrub! I love it because the sea salt in the mixture means the texture is coarse enough to remove all the dead skin anywhere on your body, but it‚Äôs still gentle enough not to harm your skin! I also loooove them smell! It smells refreshingly delicious and kind of citrusy! It has fresh organic orange juice and jasmine with hints of lemon and it just does wonders on removing impurities in your skin! This has forever been my ultimate in bath scrubs and I highly recommend this to anyone who loves pampering themselves as much as I do! This one is without doubt pretty freaking awesome! üôÇ beauty body Makeup Sat, 13 Aug 2011 7 Comments Related Posts Get VDay Glamorous!

I managed to get control of the situation, but of course, if slip for a day, my skin reacts and that means my skin all over my body! So one of my favorite blemish-fighting body scrubs that works wonders on my skin is the award-winning Nuetrogena Body Clear Body Scrub. It contains Salicylic Acid, which is a great ingredient to help keep your skin acne free! I also loooove the way it lightly foams and still removes dead skin! It is a favorite amongst beauty bloggers and has won several awards for awesomely smooth skincare! Definitely a keeper for anyone who has battled acne!! Huda‚Äôs Tip: I don‚Äôt recommend using this all over your body, since it could cause dryness if used daily, but using it on areas that are prone to breakouts, specifically your back, arms, chest and derriere will help keep your skin smooth and blemish free from head to toe! image credits neutrogena beauty drugstore Skincare Sun, 14 Aug 2011 8 Comments Related Posts If You Have Body Acne, You Need To Try This!

Personally, my signature fragrance, Hermes Rose, costs just under $300 and I would never spend a penny more (in fact, I‚Äôd like to spend a penny less)! Considering all the recent talk of a double-dip recession, I guess it seems like the perfect time to release the world‚Äôs most expensive perfume! Regardless of the economic state, DKNY has released the worlds most expensive perfume! This perfume is obviously more of a keepsake with the bottle being unbelievably pricey! With nearly 3,000 precious stones, including one 7.18-carat sapphire, a 4.03-carat diamond and a 3.07-carat ruby all on a 14-karat gold coated bottle, it seems this bottle is one you don‚Äôt want to leave just anywhere. How much does this perfume cost? Oh just $1,000,000.But is it worth it? Would you buy this if you could?

I have literally no time for anything and I am dying to start shedding the baby weight and feel normal again! While it‚Äôs hard to fit a workout in right now, my sister Alya has helped me by recommending a diet plan. One of the things she has me eating like there is no tomorrow is grapefruit. I honestly didn‚Äôt think anything of it, until my entire family asked me if I had lost weight. I was pretty surprised, but Alya actually told me it‚Äôs the grapefruit that helps increase weight loss. After researching grapefruits, I found a plethora of benefits! Grapefruit is seriously AMAZING!!! Not only does it help with virtually every disease, it is like a serious detox for your body. I was amazed to read it actually stops cancer cells from spreading and is fantastic for breast cancer patients. It also is great for diabetes since it helps regulate the sugar and starch levels in our body (also the same way it helps us lose weight). It also helps with cholesterol, digestion, insomnia, fatigue, fever, water retention (especially during pregnancy), prevents kidney stones, boosts your metabolism, as well as maaany other benefits! It‚Äôs important to limit your grapefruit consumption to 1 per day. Too many grapefruits can cause depletion of calcium which can affect your teeth and bones! beauty food health Mon, 22 Aug 2011 22 Comments Related Posts The Best Thing For Your Skin Is Completely Free Tue, 25 Jul 2017 We‚Äôre Buying An Aloe Vera Plant Right Now!

If you have a more yellow-toned base color (I am so green, it‚Äôs ridiculous!), go for shades that compliment the tone. The best way to figure out what compliments what is to base it on the color wheel. For yellow-based skin, purples work best, you could even try one that has a bit of a pinkish undertone. Try it and let me know how it works. This is an awesome question!

So of course this means I spend a lot of time trying new foundations! One that I recently tried and loved is the new Dolce &amp; Gabbana Creamy Foundation! I love this product for a number of reasons! The thing I love the most is the color choices (I use the foundation in Bronze), typically it‚Äôs hard to find foundations that match olive skin, which is ironic because most people all over the world have olive skin tones. Finally someone gets that in order to match skin, you must add olive tones, Yaaay!! Needless to say, this foundation will match almost anyone‚Äôs skin, whether rich and dark or light and creamy! Another amazing thing I love about this foundation is the coverage is amazing! Although it might seem like it‚Äôs too heavy, it definitely applies and covers extremely well. Personally, I like medium coverage, but this foundation is definitely one that is not cakey, so I would be using if I wanted the extra coverage! If you have had trouble matching your foundation and need extra coverage, this is definitely a foundation you want to try! I would also recommend this foundation for a bride or anyone looking for foundation that you can wear all night and keep the coverage looking flawless and still natural! Now the lipsticks that were also launched with the foundation are UNBELIEVABLE! I love them so much!! They are kind of between lipstick and gloss, but they provide a crazy amount of moisture and the colors are GORG!! I love the fact that after I wore one, my lips literally felt more nourished and plump! I am also in love with the intensity and color selection, but the staying power is ok. The real reason why you MUST try this lipstick is because your lips will thank you! It just feels amazing and it‚Äôs almost like a treatment for your lips that makes them look gorgeous! How Fab!!

After beating 88 contestants, Miss Angola‚Äôs Leila Lopes became Miss Universe 2011 and the first from her country! When she had been asked earlier what she might change about her physical characteristics, Leila replied that she was satisfied with who she was. ‚ÄúI consider myself a woman endowed with inner beauty,‚Äù she told the judges and the audience. I have acquired many wonderful principles from my family, and I plan to follow those through the rest of my life.‚Äô Finalists accompanying Lopes into the top five were Miss Ukraine Olesia Stefanko, Miss Philippines Shamcey Supsup, Miss China Luo Zilin and Miss Brazil Priscila Machado. While the other countries that made the top ten were Miss Australia Scherri-lee Biggs, Miss Costa Rica Johanna Solano, Miss France Laury Thilleman, Miss Portugal Laura Goncalves and Miss Panama Sheldry Saez. source dailymail Miss Universe Tue, 13 Sep 2011 3 Comments Related Posts The New Cult Beauty Box Curated By Me!

It creates a super gentle exfoliator and helps keep skin gorgeous and youthful! I looooove this recipe for a bath soak that will leave you feeling nourished and relaxed!

Looking back, 2016 has been such a major year for Huda Beauty! We launched our Lip Contours, Liquid Mattes and our Rose Gold Eyeshadow Palette ‚Äì not to mention the Lip Contour sets, the Mini Liquid Mattes (which are the cutest EVERRRR), 3 new lash styles (Noelle is my fav rn!!) and my nail polish collab with Formula X. The ultimate was winning the Digital Innovator of the Year award at the WWD Beauty Awards. Above all, I am beyond humbled by the incredible support you guys have given me and Huda Beauty. Words are not enough to express how grateful I am for all of you. You guys are like my best friends and family. Huda Beauty would never ever have been possible without you! To think that I started the blog almost 7 years ago, filming my first tutorial 27 times (video editing was still unknown territory for me so I had to keep reshooting everything in one go until it was seamless ‚Äì for real!!), and how much the brand has evolved ‚Äì all I can do is say THANK YOU, THANK YOU and THANK YOU!

One product that I recently started to use is the Philip B Blue Spray! It sounds kind of quirky, since this product can be used as an air freshner or body spray, but this product is awesome at balancing your mood and calming you almost instantly! The scent is AHHHH-mazing! It has hints of Menthol, Lavendar, Eucalyptus, Peppermint, Rosemary, and a spicy bit of Pine! It‚Äôs actually been my go-to recently when I don‚Äôt have too much time to relax, but I need a little down time! It‚Äôs such a nice change from my typical Lavender scent and I love that it has a bit of a kick! So awesome!! Huda‚Äôs Tip: Spray your sheets 10 minutes before you go to bed, including your pillow and enjoy the incredible fusion of scents! beauty health skin Wed, 5 Oct 2011 5 Comments Related Posts 7 Things I Can‚Äôt Sleep Without Sat, 13 Jan 2018 The Product You NEED for Gorgeous Beach Waves Mon, 3 Oct 2016 My New Secret Weapon: Dallas Thickening Spray Sun, 22 Jan 2017 Lara I love your nail polish üòâ Moona thaankx aloot Anna :* Anna Philip himself likes to spray it on airplane seats when he travels as it is a natural antiseptic to and gets rid of germs!

I typically wax and I have never had issues with ingrown hairs until recently! My sisters were over the other day and pointed out that one of my legs had a few ingrowns‚Äînot becoming at all! One of the reasons why ingrowns form is due to bad exfoliation and poor moisturizing. As much as I preach beauty, being a new mom has left me little time for beauty! So after scrubbing away the ingrowns and using a little extraction, I tried using this little bump relieving mask and it left skin soft and help soothe the area! You can also use this after you wax sensitive areas to prevent irritation or bumps forming later on! It‚Äôs also great to help prevent scarring since it has honey, which is a natural antibiotic! BUMP BE GONE MASK Ingredients 1 1/2 tablespoon honey 1 teaspoon olive oil 1 teaspoon yogurt 5 tablets aspirin (uncoated and crushed) Mix together honey and olive oil in a bowl until blended well (you might want to zuk it in the microwave for 5 seconds). The let cool. Mix in yogurt and aspirin and place over your ingrowns. Let sit for 15 minutes before rinsing. beauty skin Skincare Wed, 5 Oct 2011 9 Comments Related Posts My Absolute FAV Acne Miracle Mask! Only 3 Ingredients!

After all, you really need to keep the skin exfoliated everyday to prevent ingrowns. Try the Vaseline Age Renewal body lotion, it is super cheap, a huge bottle, and it contains AHA‚Äôs to slough off dead skin. I swear by it! Just don‚Äôt apply immediately after shaving or waxing bc it might sting a little. Otherwise it‚Äôs great to use on a daily basis! Here‚Äôs a link: http://www.amazon.com/Vaseline-Renewal-Redefining-Lotion-20-3oz/dp/B001ECQ5F2 niina ooohh i have huge problem with ingrowns, will def. try it! how many times should it be done? once a week? JJ ‚Äúzuk it.‚Äù LOVE IT! bonkasaurus I have read pretty much like all of your posts, and I can conclude that honey,yogurt and olive oil pretty much cure everything lol. I just have bottles of this stuff in bulk in my cupboards and i don‚Äôt cook with it. I just use it on my skin. -Bianca at http://theinbetweengirls.wordpress.com/ Coco Hi Huda! What brand of honey do you usually use? Sorry, if the question sounds stupid, but there‚Äôs so much to choose from,sometimes I‚Äôm confused which one is honey and which one just sugar syrup (bad quality honey). Readers comments are welcome, too!!! Melissa Fernandes I have had such a problem with this, been trying everything under the sun, hope this works for me as I‚Äôm left with unsightly scars from the ingrowns :'(</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>Vitamin HB | Bump Be Gone!</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>2011-10-05 00:00:00</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>3ce7-4506-aac4</string></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>732c61fd9bddd411fd93d41b303c68ae7e889bf9</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Author</name><value><array><data><value><string>hudabeauty</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>http://hudabeauty.com/2011/10/06/lancomes-seriously-silky-body-lotion/</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>PRODUCT REVIEW | BODY By Huda Heidi Kattan I wish I could put into words just how luxuriously soft this body lotion is, but there no words except perfection! It seems that Lancome has found the perfect marriage of super hydration + the most delicious aroma and put it into a body lotion! The Lancome Baume Corps is surprisingly incredible and has become my new nightstand staple! After trying it me and my sisters agree there is absolutely nothing more hydrating with zero greasiness! It‚Äôs one of those things that makes you feel super sexy when you put it on and it kind of makes you feel like this is the way your skin should be feeling! The milk-based body lotion helps add radiance to your skin and uses rose extract to not only leave you smelling delicious, but also soothes and protects your skin!

Soooo just after I gave birth, I ended up flying out to Lebanon for an interview with Yasmina.com! I had such a great time at the interview and everyone was sooo sweet! I had literally given birth just 6 weeks before, so I couldn‚Äôt bare leaving Nour (although she didn‚Äôt notice)! So I literally flew in, with my makeup on, then flew out as soon as the interview was done! It was hectic! But I met a really adorable fan in the airport who was sooo cute! The interview is in English, but we tried doing it in Arabic at first, but my Arabic sounds kind of like a kid speaking so we moved into English quickly! üôÇ I need to practice!! Check it out here!

Ingredients 1/2 Teaspoon Olive Oil 1 Teaspoon Honey 3 Teaspoon Sugar Splash of Lemon Mix all ingredients together in a bowl, then massage onto lips.

Tue, 4 Apr 2017 Shumaila Hey huda, I had like a whitish complexion and somehow since an year it has turned into a yellowish pale complexion which has been bothering me since a while. I thought the sun was the reason so I started using sunscreen but it didnt help. How can I fix that? Thank you so much! Also, you‚Äôre awesome. I read every blog of yours .&lt; it's awesome. I kinda also use these ingredients for a body scrub. I just love how soft ur skin feels after u apply it. It's great üôÇ Natural healer You should not treat your lips all the time with any type of lip balm as you‚Äôll strip the natural oils from it‚Ä¶ Thus the need of having to use it daily and having chapped unhealthy lips all the time. Your best bet is to toss out all lip balm and allow the process of natural healing to take place‚Ä¶ Sure it will feel unpleasant for awhile but your lips will love you for it later and you‚Äôll love your lips too. Jagee Loved it Darling mona I just tried this! Absolutely love it! Thanks Huda xo. Jen do you mix one dose or can you make extra and keep it in the fridge? Fajas Can I use a calamondi or a ‚Äúcalamansi‚Äù instead of lemon? we dont have those locally available in our country. shari How should I store the leftovers? stevo works beautifully!! moisturizing, tasty, and easy!! Brittany I love using homemade beauty recipes, but I wanted to let y‚Äôall know that if you don‚Äôt want dry lips ever again‚Ä¶. use Vicks (yes as in Vicks vapo rub) I put it on every night before bed and I never have dry lips, my mom has been doing this for years and years and I‚Äôve been using it for as long as I can remember‚Ä¶ it does feel tingly but that just means its working! try it and you‚Äôll never be sorry üôÇ plus those bottles last forever‚Ä¶ enjoy!!! mani I had heard that lemon is very useful for skin‚Ä¶but your post has proved it‚Ä¶thanks a lot for such a nice post. rachael I didnt use lemon and it still made my lips super soft. I also used my finger to scrub some on my nose to clean out my pores and blackheads, and it made my skin really soft and exfoliated. mary My lips feel amazing!!!! Harsh new cold weather was chapping my lips and no amount of burts bees or carmax was working!!! Its always good to know natural ingredients are around to help üôÇ Only thing is I have so much left over and do not know what to do with it.

I‚Äôve said this before, but I actually like flaws! I think a nose that is slightly large or an interesting beauty mark or gapped teeth can be not only beautiful, but quite charming. That being said, I understand the risks involved of changing through plastic surgery, which is why if I ever did go under the knife I would do more than my fair share of research on the procedure and the doctor involved. So am I surprised that a Miami woman was injected with cement during her plastic surgery, well, Continue reading in DIY - NATURAL Vitamin HB | Super Cool De-Puff Eye Mask! by hudabeauty Sun, 27 Nov 2011 2 Comments DAILY DOSE | SKINCARE By Huda Heidi Kattan I‚Äôve never been a huge sleeper!

Of course that is simply just not an option and being an advocate of beauty, it‚Äôs my job to at least look like I know what I‚Äôm doing!

I absolutely looove things that let you do at home beauty treatments! So when I saw Nail Rock, I was seriously excited! They are super shiny and some of the awesomest nail designs I have ever seen! They are actually really easy to use too! All you need to do is apply some nail polish remover then put the stickers on! I will be honest, it can be a little tricky in the beginning getting them to go on without creasing, but it gets easier! I actually put them on my toes since they were so wicked! I was wearing a gorgeous maroon and gold dress (from Valley Dez) to the Emirates Woman Awards and I wanted my nails to match! So I added a top coat of Peridot from Chanel and it made my nails look metallic like real snake skin!

Only 3 Ingredients! Thu, 29 Dec 2016 Sabrima What is fruit apply? WTO This is a really interesting post! thanks:D I was actually browsing through some of your older posts and i noticed that you talk about everything and anything even remotely beauty related (which is really cool!), however i have an issue that nobody, not even you, has really dealt with. I have two toned lips, basically my top lip is dark (brown with a very discreet hint of pink) and my lower one is most definitely pink and although i don‚Äôt normally wear much make-up, when i do, i dread the time when i‚Äôm going to have to apply lipstick because a) the lipstick NEVER looks the way it does in the tube, not even close and B) i feel like wearing lipstick only emphasizes my darker top lip üôÅ and c) it would seem from research and personal experience that only really dark colors will look the same on both top and bottom lip and i‚Äôm not having that because they are WAY too overpowering for my features and my make-up style and they makes me look older (not cool). I have spent numerous hours on the internet looking for anything that may help but all that i‚Äôve come across is to use concealer/foundation on my top lip (despite it‚Äôs drying effects) to tone down the ‚Äòpigmentation‚Äô or to use ‚Äòlip-concealers‚Äô (although how that‚Äôs any different from average concealer i don‚Äôt know) and when i go make up shopping (which you‚Äôve really gotten me into!:P) I hear the same thing over and over ‚Äòthe only thing that will work for you is dark lipstick‚Äô. Should i just settle for the advice of beauty counter make-up artists? and what i‚Äôve come across on the internet?:( Don‚Äôt get me wrong, i‚Äôm being realistic here, i‚Äôm not asking for advice on how to create a nude lip‚Ä¶i just want lipstick that doesn‚Äôt look cheap/badly applied/horrific when applied to BOTH my top and bottom lip. Is it too much to ask? I‚Äôm pretty sure i‚Äôm not the only one out there with this problem, i just wish someone would actually recommend a lipstick brand/type/shade that would work well for people like me or at the very least address the issue! You have a very candid and practical approach to beauty and I respect that about you and it‚Äôs one of the reasons i trust your taste, your advice and your home remedies and I hope that two-toned lips will be your next blog post!:D Much Love! Tammy This mask sounds good. I think if you tried it on you top lip more often you might get some lightining to it since the acid in th apple works like that. Also have you tried the long lasting lipsticks? They are normally not sheer and have nice shades try lipfinity from maxfactor. PS: I not Huda just wanted to help. Luv and peace merisha huda, i did love to see you address this issue in your upcoming posts.. My bro‚Äôs at times points my doubled shaded lips and claims i smoke secrectly!!! :/ lime and honey is tried and always licked off! (by myself üòÄ ) anything else? LoveNiki I love how easy this beauty recipe is, I will definitely try it as soon as I can üôÇ Samra üòâ must try thnx babe üôÇ Mitsa G. Huda, I have to tell you that I never use to do any type of facials at all be it at home or at a spa. I always thought that it took way to much time and money to go, but ever since I started viewing our videos and reading your amazing blog, and I started to do the facials and masks at home and man what a change I have seen in my skin. I was always blessed ( thank you Allah (SWT) with clear skin no marks. I have tired the tomato facial, the okra, the Strawberry on my teeth. I am just so impressed. I have gotten so much complements lately on my skin. I noticed my skin looks amazing with out Makeup which was not the case before. Please continue to post more wonderful home facials and your list of your current favorite or all time favorite skin care and make up. You and your sisters are absolutely gorgeous girls.

Our long-term MUA crush and makeup legend, Val Garland , has been sprinkling her magic along the runways, on magazine covers, and on celebrities for decades, and now she‚Äôs joining L‚ÄôOr√©al Paris as their global makeup director. Excited is an understatement. Val has been responsible for some seriously iconic beauty looks: glitter eyeshadow, flower face painting, Lady Gaga‚Äôs prosthetic Born This Way cheekbone look, and most recently #SnoggedLips. Her penchant for color and her inspirational creativity is second-to-none. She‚Äôs worked on the runways of Preen, Erdem, Alexander McQueen and Mary Katrantzou to name a few, and on countless fashion editorials with photographers like Mario Testino. Now she‚Äôs bringing her creative touch to the product innovation and beauty direction at L‚ÄôOr√©al. The idea that such an incredibly creative and well-respected MUA like Val Garland will be at the helm of such a huge beauty brand is a revolutionary step in the beauty world, and we cannot wait to see how the brand evolves.

And as much as we believe we are paying for quality, a lot of times I think we know we are only paying for the logo! I actually remember my makeup teacher telling me that a lot of the drugstore makeup we see is manufactured in the same warehouses as our super pricey makeup, NYX was specifically one that was mentioned! If you feel NYX cosmetics, you know it feels reeeally good! Although the price tag is definitely drugstore, the makeup is not! I love their eyeshadow palettes, brow shapers and I die for their lip glosses! The lip glosses last super long, feel amazing on, and smell delicious! Every time I put one on, I get compliments on my lips! Here are a few of my favorite colors!

I honestly believe what we put inside our bodies and how happy we are really defines how beautiful we are on the outside! I think the more we eat bad foods, smoke, drink alcohol and pout, the less we look the way we really want to‚Äìsuper gorgeous! So if being beautiful starts from within, cleansing is a huge part of keeping us gorgeous inside out! A great beauty food that is SOOOOO good for you and we all MUST start to eat right away is figs . Figs are so good at cleansing our systems and revealing radiant skin! They are also great at helping us maintain our body weight, reduce the risk of heart disease, help reduce the risk of colon and breast cancer, is super high in antioxidants, and contains high amounts of B6, Calcium, and Iron, which means it helps keep us beautiful and healthy!

I was extremely honored to have her in our studio (ahem‚Ä¶we might be a little obsessed with how cool she is) and due to all your amazing feedback about the video, we decided to put together the Top 10 Things we learnt from Dr Doris Day. Trust me, your skincare routine will never be the same again!! 1. Adult acne is different from teenage acne. It is usually triggered by an imbalance of hormones and it often starts after your teenage years, sometimes in your mid 20‚Äôs to 30‚Äôs. It appears as cysts and pimples along the jawline, chin and lower face. This kind of acne is difficult to control without careful guidance from your dermatologist and can often lead to scarring. Teen acne is more visible over the entire face. Both adult and teen acne can occur on the back, chest and shoulders. 2. Cleansing your skin is REALLY important! Dr. Doris recommends that you do this daily and suggests that cleansing brushes are a better option than simply using your hands or a washcloth. 3. Your skin has its own personal bouncer or immune cells to protect it and is constantly regenerating itself to protect you from infection and aging. New skin cells take about 7 days to grow and fully regenerate or turn over every 30 days or so. If this process doesn‚Äôt work properly due to acne or dry or sun damaged skin, your skin will look dull, uneven in tone and ultimately wrinkled over time. 4. The sun makes your oil glands over-grow which makes your pores bigger and can ultimately make acne worse. YIKES! 5. Botox and Fillers are excellent tools to help you look your best and stay looking beautiful as you age, however it‚Äôs important to see an aesthetic physician who will make sure you look like the best version of yourself without looking unnatural. Botox is a very safe and reliable treatment for rejuvenation when used properly and in the right areas. In order to look as natural as possible, do not try to eliminate all your lines and wrinkles in your face. The goal is to re-train muscles so you can move and always look beautiful. 6. Don‚Äôt try new skin care products or treatments right before an important event. Stick to what you are used to and what you know works well for your skin. Keep your skin fresh: exfoliate, moisturize, apply a mask, drink water, listen to calm music, think positive thoughts and rest well. Changing your skincare routine can risk you getting a breakout or irritation especially when you have the stress of an upcoming event. 7. Eat all your meals within a 12 hour window, for example 9am-9pm. This will help balance your circadian rhythm which controls genes that affect metabolism and will help you lose weight. 8. It‚Äôs okay to use a moisturizer or foundation which has SPF as your sunscreen, however the key is to use enough and to reapply it every two hours if you‚Äôre outdoors. If you don‚Äôt want to keep reapplying over makeup, look for a powder SPF for the re-application during the day. 9. Your skin repairs while you sleep and it also loses more water at night than during the day so the best thing you can do for your skin at night is to apply a good layer of moisturizer and antioxidants, and gently pat or massage it into your skin, always applying pressure upwards your head. 10. Both UVB and UVA rays can damage your skin and UVA rays can even penetrate through window glass (even tinted ones!), unless they are specifically UV protected, and are a contributing factor towards skin sagging and aging.

The first time I tried Olay, I really wasn‚Äôt expecting anything spectacular, partly because I had tried everything under the moon and it became kind of my own mantra that for great skin, you should spare no expense! Needless to say I have spent unthinkable amounts on skincare through the years and I just didn‚Äôt really think a drugstore brand like Olay would give me the same results that my high-end face creams would‚Äìthat is, until I tried it! Now it‚Äôs shocking to me how I missed so many important points that come from brands that have been around for years working with some killer R&amp;D to bring great products to you at an affordable price (hence, the reason why I HAD to create a ‚ÄúDrugstore Product of the Week‚Äù). Sooo, when I read that Olay was one of the Reader‚Äôs Choice Awards for Allure magazine, which to me is kind of the beauty bible, I had to try their Total Effects since it had won so many awards! I recently started using it (probably for a little over a week now) and so far my skin loves it! I am using the Total Effects Day and Night Creams and the firming action is AWESOME from the Night Cream, that I actually use it on my neck as well! The Day cream is phenomenal at providing moisture to dry skin, it just makes you feel hydrated! I have a confession, and my hubby will never admit to this, but this weekend we actually went on a little getaway to Ras Al Khaimah. It was amazing, but as much as I had poured on the SPF 100, I got a slight tan and my hubby almost burnt! He is sooo against using face creams, but he had to use something since his skin was so dry! He actually loved the Total Effects Day Cream and it completely healed his skin and kept it from peeling at all, which was awesome! I definitely recommend this cream! If you are using it climates where it is extremely hot, try letting your skin soak up the cream, then blot lightly with a tissue before you apply makeup for an all day beautiful appearance! image credits dealfindingchik beauty products skin Skincare Sun, 29 May 2011 6 Comments Related Posts Why Your Faithful Skincare Regime Is Failing To Come Through Fri, 3 Nov 2017 If You Want To Look Like These Celebs At 50, This Is‚Ä¶ Wed, 4 Oct 2017 Ten Skincare Products That Changed My Life Tue, 6 Jun 2017 Alia But I forgot to mention that ive tried this product and it broke me out ..

I‚Äôm aware a lot of medical research involves animal testing, but the more I read about it and the conditions the animals are in the more i feel this knot everytime I consider buying products from companies well-known for that. And unfortunately, olay is. I‚Äôve never really been a fan of it, but i thought i should share. I also stopped buying l‚Äôoreal and am trying to find friendlier alternatives in terms of make up and skincare because i don‚Äôt think animals should suffer so we look beautiful. sigh‚Ä¶.warned you, this is a party pooper msg.

So, I did this super quick Zombie-inspired Halloween tutorial using just liquid lipsticks, with a combination of Kylie Cosmetics, Huda Beauty, NYX, and Jeffree Star Cosmetics. These shades were just what I had lying around, but you can use any liquid lipsticks in similar tones and they‚Äôll have the same effect. Even if you don‚Äôt have some of the shades in a lipstick, you can just use eyeshadow as an alternative. I love that this looks like you‚Äôve put in loads effort, but it‚Äôs actually super easy to do! I‚Äôm obsessed with these zombie contacts (you can find really affordable options on Amazon), but it still looks super creepy with just the makeup if you aren‚Äôt able to get contacts in time.

However, no one knows this is a problem (I hide it well). Since I was about the age of nine, my older sister ( Alya‚Äôs Fit Club ) taught me how to keep my knees and elbows super light and even with the rest of my body. She would cut a lemon and rub it on that might need brightening! It worked so well, I thought I would never find anything better! Recently I read that celebrities use the same method but actually add a pinch of sea salt to the lemon half before rubbing! The results? Sooo much more effective! Celebs like Jennifer Lopez use this technique a few weeks before an important event to keep their skin looking perfectly even! Love it!!

When I really need them to lighten up, I sometimes do it twice a day, but I recommend once every night for a couple of weeks! Hope it works out for you darling! I swear by it! XXxx Mary Monroe thanks! Sarah omg knees are my issue too..do you know anything about applying body makeup on your knees? if you do can u plzzz blog it üôÇ hudabeauty Hi darling! Generally speaking applying makeup on your knees is not advisable, just because there is extra skin there which might lead to makeup being obvious if applied there.

What we realized is pretty much every one of your favorite beauty treatments ‚Äì from toners to toothpaste ‚Äì can be found as a solid. Here are some of our faves: 1) Damaged Hot Oil Treatment Ever tried hot chocolate on a stick? You know, where you melt the chocolate by stirring it in a cup of hot milk? This inspired the cutest hot oil hair treatment from Lush. Their vegan Damaged treatment is a solid block of nourishing virgin olive oil, almond oil, and avocado oil (all superstars for shiny, strong hair) on a stick that you melt by stirring in a cup of hot water. After it cools, apply and leave on dry hair for 20 minutes then shampoo out (might take more than one go to get all the oil out). The result is hydrated locks with a beautiful vanilla scent we can‚Äôt get enough of. Tip we learned: If you find you don‚Äôt need the whole mixture for one use, cover it and keep it in the fridge until you‚Äôre ready to melt it down again for another use. 2) Honey I Washed My Hair Shampoo Bar We get it if a solid shampoo seems scary‚Ä¶it‚Äôs unchartered territory for most. But trust us, this is not to be underestimated. The self-preserving bar packs a punch of at least 80 washes which is the equivalent of three bottles of shampoo ‚Äì all in a tiny little bar. Just wet the bar and rub between hands to lather, and add to damp hair. It will sud up beautifully and clean your hair thoroughly. The honey will leave hair ridiculously soft. Extra points for easing your travel woes. No more throwing out oversized bottles of liquid at security. 3) Tea Tree and Dream Steam Toner Tabs For a legit blackhead buster, try one of these toner tabs. Just drop it in bowl of hot water like an alka seltzer and it will fizz up, dissipating in the steam. Hang over it with a towel over your head for a skin clearing (thank you, tea tree oil) and calming (lavender) blend of toning goodness. It‚Äôs like bringing the spa home. A cool tip we learned: put the water in a plastic spray bottle after use to store in the fridge for up to two days. You can use it to spritz on your face for a little pick-me-up. 4) Full of Grace Serum Bar A power moisturizer full of vitamins and skin calming chamomile blue oil and calamine powder, this little bar (that can be easily mistaken for soap) is actually a serum that feels like butter on the skin. Gently glide it over your face for a soft layer of serum that you can massage into skin. With ingredients like almond oil, murumuru and cupuaco butter, it‚Äôs amazing for dry skin, especially during the colder months. 5) Miles of Smiles Toothy Tabs Yup, even your toothpaste can come in a tablet. A cool, different take on cleaning your teeth, just bite into one of these to crumble them in your mouth (don‚Äôt eat it!) and promptly start brushing the mix of baking soda and mint oils to freshen breath and clean your pearly whites so they stay that way. You‚Äôll be amazed at how much it foams up with just a little water! Fair warning, this doesn‚Äôt taste amazing, unless you‚Äôre into that baking soda taste. But we did find it does a heavy duty job on cleaning teeth. Plus, it‚Äôs always nice to definitively see when you‚Äôre down to your last tablet, rather than squeezing a toothpaste tube for dear life and hoping for one more drop.

But let‚Äôs be honest, although we love the idea of getting all dressed up, the thought of spending a ton of money on an outfit we will most likely never where again is a little depressing (especially when we have a long list of beauty products sitting in our shopping baskets). So, we‚Äôve put together nine seriously scary Halloween looks to inspire you, and all you‚Äôll need is a little (or a lot of) makeup and a bit of determination‚Ä¶ Queen of the Dead Sometimes you want to look like you made an effort to be creepy, but you also don‚Äôt want to completely terrify the hottie at work, this is probably your best solution! Skill level: You finally get along with false lashes. Shimmering Egyptian Queen If you‚Äôd rather slay than make people afraid, then this Cleopatra tutorial is for you. We‚Äôre just wondering if it would be possible to pull this look off on the daily? Skill level: You‚Äôre familiar with a cut crease, and your willpower to slay knows no bounds. Intense Ripped Skin Demon Look If you‚Äôre really looking to freak people out, get your red-toned palette out and be ready to paint! This Demon look by Nikkie Tutorials is giving us major creeps. Skill level: You have contouring down to a fine art and a lot of time on your hands. Easy Werewolf Look We‚Äôre not sure how, but somehow, this look almost makes facial hair look a little, dare we say, sexy?! Another added bonus, if you already have a little facial hair, you can really make this work for you üòâ Skill level: You‚Äôve been wearing lipstick for years, and you own black eyeliner. Neon Skull If you ever wondered what a skeleton x 21 st century looked like, this is it. We love James Charles‚Äô refreshing take on the classic skull. Skill level: You know which brushes will blend out your eyeshadow best. Classic Sexy Cat Let‚Äôs be real, Halloween just isn‚Äôt for some of us, and that‚Äôs why the geniuses from a long time ago decided that whiskers and a cat eye were a fitting Halloween costume. A cat is, after all, a witch‚Äôs sidekick. Skill level: You‚Äôve attempted, and sort of successfully achieved cat liner in the past. Clown Skull with a Twist Last-minute Halloween invite? This is your answer to getting in the spirit in fifteen minutes. Skill level: You‚Äôve mastered mascara for years. Twilight Inspired Vampire Twilight may have been around for a while, but you can still channel your inner Bella (you can pretend Edward bit you) and look both creepy and kind of cute at the same time. Plus, it‚Äôs a great excuse to rock your black lipstick. Skill level: You‚Äôve applied makeup before, and it didn‚Äôt look terrible.

While I wouldn‚Äôt necessarily recommend it for hair loss, it‚Äôs AMAZING for making your hair grow faster! It has Cayenne Pepper which is a complete gem at stimulating your hair follicles!

What we realized is pretty much every one of your favorite beauty treatments ‚Äì from toners to toothpaste ‚Äì can be found as a solid. Here are some of our faves: 1) Damaged Hot Oil Treatment Ever tried hot chocolate on a stick? You know, where you melt the chocolate by stirring it in a cup of hot milk? This inspired the cutest hot oil hair treatment from Lush. Their vegan Damaged treatment is a solid block of nourishing virgin olive oil, almond oil, and avocado oil (all superstars for shiny, strong hair) on a stick that you melt by stirring in a cup of hot water. After it cools, apply and leave on dry hair for 20 minutes then shampoo out (might take more than one go to get all the oil out). The result is hydrated locks with a beautiful vanilla scent we can‚Äôt get enough of. Tip we learned: If you find you don‚Äôt need the whole mixture for one use, cover it and keep it in the fridge until you‚Äôre ready to melt it down again for another use. 2) Honey I Washed My Hair Shampoo Bar We get it if a solid shampoo seems scary‚Ä¶it‚Äôs unchartered territory for most. But trust us, this is not to be underestimated. The self-preserving bar packs a punch of at least 80 washes which is the equivalent of three bottles of shampoo ‚Äì all in a tiny little bar. Just wet the bar and rub between hands to lather, and add to damp hair. It will sud up beautifully and clean your hair thoroughly. The honey will leave hair ridiculously soft. Extra points for easing your travel woes. No more throwing out oversized bottles of liquid at security. 3) Tea Tree and Dream Steam Toner Tabs For a legit blackhead buster, try one of these toner tabs. Just drop it in bowl of hot water like an alka seltzer and it will fizz up, dissipating in the steam. Hang over it with a towel over your head for a skin clearing (thank you, tea tree oil) and calming (lavender) blend of toning goodness. It‚Äôs like bringing the spa home. A cool tip we learned: put the water in a plastic spray bottle after use to store in the fridge for up to two days. You can use it to spritz on your face for a little pick-me-up. 4) Full of Grace Serum Bar A power moisturizer full of vitamins and skin calming chamomile blue oil and calamine powder, this little bar (that can be easily mistaken for soap) is actually a serum that feels like butter on the skin. Gently glide it over your face for a soft layer of serum that you can massage into skin. With ingredients like almond oil, murumuru and cupuaco butter, it‚Äôs amazing for dry skin, especially during the colder months. 5) Miles of Smiles Toothy Tabs Yup, even your toothpaste can come in a tablet. A cool, different take on cleaning your teeth, just bite into one of these to crumble them in your mouth (don‚Äôt eat it!) and promptly start brushing the mix of baking soda and mint oils to freshen breath and clean your pearly whites so they stay that way. You‚Äôll be amazed at how much it foams up with just a little water! Fair warning, this doesn‚Äôt taste amazing, unless you‚Äôre into that baking soda taste. But we did find it does a heavy duty job on cleaning teeth. Plus, it‚Äôs always nice to definitively see when you‚Äôre down to your last tablet, rather than squeezing a toothpaste tube for dear life and hoping for one more drop.

We want it so bad that we‚Äôre prepared to spend A LOT on any product that promises to nurture our hair into red-carpet readiness. Shampoos, conditioners, serums, leave in sprays, there are thousands of products promising bigger, better, stronger locks. But what if we told you there was a way of achieving all that and more without you having to spend your dedicated Sephora money on your hair. We‚Äôve pulled together our favorite DIY hair masks to make the most of all that nature has to offer. Whether you‚Äôre looking to revitalize your sun-damaged hair, rid yourself of dandruff, or give it shine that glows brighter than your latest highlighter, we‚Äôve got a DIY remedy for it. Repair DIY mask for dry and damaged hair Practically everything is working against you having instagrammable hair 24/7, from products and straighteners to shower water, UV rays, dyes, and pollution. For most of us, this results in dry, brittle hair. Fortunately, it‚Äôs also one of the easiest problems to treat. This coconut oil mask adds much-needed moisture and nutrients to your hair, as coconut oil‚Äôs high levels of MCFAs (medium chain fatty acids) and lauric acid supports the hormone and cellular health of your hair. If you‚Äôre someone who is a product-fiend or serial hair straightener/curler, even if the damage has seemingly not taken root (pun intended) use this mask at least once a week. Ingredients: 2 tbsps of coconut oil 2 tbsps of argan oil (supplement with olive oil or canola if argan isn‚Äôt available) 1 egg 2-3 drops of peppermint essential oil, or lavender oil Combine the ingredients and whisk together until well-blended. Apply the mask evenly over damp hair (think towel-dried consistency), paying particular attention to the ends of your hair. If you suffer from dandruff or a dry scalp, work the mix into the roots, too. Clip your hair up, so you don‚Äôt get oil everywhere, and cover with a shower cap. Let the mask sit for 30 minutes before rinsing with your daily shampoo and conditioner. If you have long or thick hair, you can double the recipe. Clarifying DIY mask for oily roots There is NOTHING more annoying than oily hair! Oily hair could be caused by anything from overuse of products, using too many protein-based shampoos and conditioners, and fluctuations in hormones. If your oily hair has more grease than gleam, this lemon-based mask is essential; it‚Äôs filled with vitamin C and A, essential for bright and healthy hair. Because the mask is acidic, it breaks down sebum in oily hair and removes excess oil from your scalp. Salt, while helping scrub and remove impurities, will also separate oil from your follicles by absorbing it. Using coconut oil on oily hair might seem weird, but we don‚Äôt want to remove all oil; just the unnecessary stuff that‚Äôs weighing your hair down. Ingredients: 1/3 cup of lemon juice (or lime) 1 tablespoon of sea salt (use crystals instead of refined table salt) 1 teaspoon of coconut oil Mix all the ingredients into a part scrub, part liquid shampoo mixture. Rather than working it into the bottoms of your hair, focus on working this formula all over your scalp. Leave on for 5 to 10 minutes before rinsing with warm water and shampoo ‚Äì just don‚Äôt condition it. Growth boosting DIY mask for longer locks Long healthy hair might seem like an impossible goal, but we promise it is. This mask uses canola oil, which is deemed to be a perfect choice for hair related issues like hair loss and chronic dryness. Like coconut oil, the presence of unsaturated fatty acids helps sooth frazzled follicles and locks them together to prevent moisture loss. Canola oil is also rich in vitamin E, an antioxidant that helps repair and build tissue, as well as sterol, which helps damaged cells recover. Canola oil puts your hair in a good enough state that it focuses less on regeneration and repair, and more on growth. Both Jojoba oil and rosemary oil are capable of stimulating hair growth by improving blood circulation and moisturizing any dry or damaged hair follicles. This mask not only leaves your hair super soft but it will keep your scalp in the best condition for optimized hair growth. Ingredients: 2 tablespoons of canola oil 2 tablespoons of jojoba oil (grab some hazelnut or grapeseed if you don‚Äôt have jojoba oil) 1 egg 2-3 drops of rosemary oil (lemongrass is a great substitute) Whisk the ingredients together and apply it to damp hair. Leave on for 20 minutes and repeat once a week. Rinse with warm water before using your shampoo and conditioner.

HB Team Hi my love, check out my posts on how to recover your hair on a budget here . Hope this helps üôÇ xxx Nadz Hi Huda, Thanks for all the hair mask tips. I got oily roots but I heard if you apply lemon on your hair roots if will fade out your hair colour especially if you have coloured your hair roots. HB Team Hi my love, if you leave it on for long periods of time lemon can fade color. To be careful you could use this mask for twenty minutes and be sure to apply to damp hair. xxx A.D Hi huda, Thank you for life saving DIYs. I read them all and try to follow them. My hair is oily yet i struggle with dandruff once is a while(especially in winters). Pls suggest me DIY for my hair type. Thank you. Xx. isabella if it comes in winter it could be that you‚Äôre not drying your hair properly, if not try putting oils in your hair. i use schwarzkopf daily oil elixir and it does a good job for me.. hope this helps?</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>3 Super Easy DIY Hair Rescue Masks</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>2017-11-13 00:00:00</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>3ce7-4506-aac4</string></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>05bb6b7bd3f6f93e6ac05de9fc04550b1166b69d</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>lush</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>http://hudabeauty.com/tag/lush/</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>in beauty , product review 5 Crazy Cool Products We Discovered at a Lush Party by HB Team Wed, 12 Oct 2016 Leave a comment Our office has no shortage of Lush fans, so there wasn‚Äôt much convincing that needed to be done when they put together perhaps one of the best-smelling parties we‚Äôve ever had in the office. What we realized is pretty much every one of your favorite beauty treatments ‚Äì from toners to toothpaste ‚Äì can be found as a solid. Here are some of our faves: 1) Damaged Hot Oil Treatment Ever tried hot chocolate on a stick? You know, where you melt the chocolate by stirring it in a cup of hot milk? This inspired the cutest hot oil hair treatment from Lush. Their vegan Damaged treatment is a solid block of nourishing virgin olive oil, almond oil, and avocado oil (all superstars for shiny, strong hair) on a stick that you melt by stirring in a cup of hot water. After it cools, apply and leave on dry hair for 20 minutes then shampoo out (might take more than one go to get all the oil out). The result is hydrated locks with a beautiful vanilla scent we can‚Äôt get enough of. Tip we learned: If you find you don‚Äôt need the whole mixture for one use, cover it and keep it in the fridge until you‚Äôre ready to melt it down again for another use. 2) Honey I Washed My Hair Shampoo Bar We get it if a solid shampoo seems scary‚Ä¶it‚Äôs unchartered territory for most. But trust us, this is not to be underestimated. The self-preserving bar packs a punch of at least 80 washes which is the equivalent of three bottles of shampoo ‚Äì all in a tiny little bar. Just wet the bar and rub between hands to lather, and add to damp hair. It will sud up beautifully and clean your hair thoroughly. The honey will leave hair ridiculously soft. Extra points for easing your travel woes. No more throwing out oversized bottles of liquid at security. 3) Tea Tree and Dream Steam Toner Tabs For a legit blackhead buster, try one of these toner tabs. Just drop it in bowl of hot water like an alka seltzer and it will fizz up, dissipating in the steam. Hang over it with a towel over your head for a skin clearing (thank you, tea tree oil) and calming (lavender) blend of toning goodness. It‚Äôs like bringing the spa home. A cool tip we learned: put the water in a plastic spray bottle after use to store in the fridge for up to two days. You can use it to spritz on your face for a little pick-me-up. 4) Full of Grace Serum Bar A power moisturizer full of vitamins and skin calming chamomile blue oil and calamine powder, this little bar (that can be easily mistaken for soap) is actually a serum that feels like butter on the skin. Gently glide it over your face for a soft layer of serum that you can massage into skin. With ingredients like almond oil, murumuru and cupuaco butter, it‚Äôs amazing for dry skin, especially during the colder months. 5) Miles of Smiles Toothy Tabs Yup, even your toothpaste can come in a tablet. A cool, different take on cleaning your teeth, just bite into one of these to crumble them in your mouth (don‚Äôt eat it!) and promptly start brushing the mix of baking soda and mint oils to freshen breath and clean your pearly whites so they stay that way. You‚Äôll be amazed at how much it foams up with just a little water! Fair warning, this doesn‚Äôt taste amazing, unless you‚Äôre into that baking soda taste. But we did find it does a heavy duty job on cleaning teeth. Plus, it‚Äôs always nice to definitively see when you‚Äôre down to your last tablet, rather than squeezing a toothpaste tube for dear life and hoping for one more drop.

Many women (and some guys) said that they used head massage for hair growth and it really worked! However, one very interesting member told me that she has her own way of getting the most out of her massage. Instead of just doing a regular head massage, she massages her head upside down. Sound crazy? It‚Äôs brilliant! It actually helps with the blood flow when your head is upside down while the massage makes sure that all of your hair follicles get the right amount of attention. I have been addicted to this new method and I‚Äôve been doing it every day! I simply stand up, then bend all the way over as if I were reaching my toes to stretch my hamstrings. I massage my head for a couple of minutes, and believe me, you can feel the blood flow! Try this as often as possible to help encourage hair growth and health! image credits centralfloridapersonaltrainers bad beauty cut hair Hair follicle health heidi huda kattan long Massage Therapy and Bodywork shopping Mon, 13 Sep 2010 6 Comments Related Posts Could Sleeping With Your Hair Up Cause Hair Loss?

I used to spend every weekend buying BAAGS of Lush so much that my entire apartment smelt like Lush‚Äîahhh there is no better feeling! I love Lush because they are super natural and use just basic ingredients!

At my recent visit to Lush I picked up their Lush Mint Julips Lip Scrub. The reason why I bought it was honestly because of the smell! It‚Äôs a mix of chocolate, sugar, and mint‚Äîahhh, divine! Aside from smelling like Mint Chocolate Chip ice cream when I tried this on my hand, it felt super smooth and gentle, so I had to get it! THE RESULTS: I‚Äôm convinced, this lip scrub has super powers! Not only does it make my lips super soft, but the mint extracts in the mixture make my lips this gorgeous red! I love that it is a great scrub that you can take with you easily everywhere, but I will say the scrub comes really full, so you definitely need to keep the cap clean to avoid sugar going everywhere! It‚Äôs also a DRY scrub, so there‚Äôs no oil, you just wet your lips and work the scrub into them. I thought maybe it might need some liquid of some type, but it works fine with just a little water! This will make your lips soooooo soft! A MUST!!! lip lush scrub Mon, 25 Jun 2012 7 Comments Related Posts Is The Sea Your Answer To The Softest Lips Ever?

In case you missed Part 1 &amp; 2, check them out here: Part 1/3 and Part 2/3 Hair Recovery is a looong process which requires a lot of patience, but the main thing is that you have to give yourself at least 4-odd weeks before you start seeing a difference. It‚Äôs taken me almost 6 months to fix mine so I def get your frustration! If you guys have read my first two tips about the Coconut Oil and Biotin, here‚Äôs my final tip for recovering your hair on a budget! Use a highly effective product like Kerastase Densifique. Yes, I know ‚Äì this product is not exactly on the budget-friendly bracket but it has really helped my hair soooo much! There are a few alternatives available on the market so definitely check them out (like Liquid Biotin and Keratin). What I did: o Make sure you have clean hands o It says you take a whole ampoule, twice a day (I just use a third of that, still twice a day though) o Apply and massage the product into your roots and scalp. Every morning and at night. Actually, just by massaging your head you‚Äôll stimulate hair growth. As your blood flows, you improve circulation and that improves hair growth. I know it sounds weird, but massaging your scalp is very VERY effective!! I have a double-whammy trick to help my hair fall stop and make it look thicker: I use a mix of K√©rastase Densifique Minoxidil solution (which helps to add density to hair) and a dark eyeshadow shade (here I used Too Faced‚Äôs Natural Matte Palette) to cover up any exposed scalp areas. You can see a difference in just minutes with this super easy beauty hack! A video posted by Huda Kattan (@hudabeauty) on Sep 7, 2016 at 10:23am PDT EXTRA TIPS: Eating, of course, is veeeery important. As they say, you are what you eat. Eat foods that are high in Omega-3 like Salmon ‚Äì I normally just grill it at home and eat it twice a week. This will help your hair become shinier and healthier, as well as prevent breakage. I would also recommend eating walnuts as snacks (maybe twice a week) because they are full of B-vitamins which is great for hair and nails. So my loves, these are some of the things I‚Äôve been doing to recover my hair ‚Äì and trust me, they‚Äôre working!! Let me know if you have any questions, and I hope this series helped you guys a bit! Xx PS None of these posts have been sponsored.

Elise Morgan After I bleached my hair it was a disaster, and the product which helped me save it was this one http://www.facialco.com.au/brand/nioxin/system-3.html . And it did magic. But for the next time I‚Äôll follow your steps, they look promising. aseel any idea where i could find the oil in abudhabi? ISRAA Hey huda, I have terrible hair loss situation going on NOT EVEN words can explain my hair situation and i needed help I did try the coconut oil and it helped in the texture of the hair but not filling the bold spot. Maybe i can send you pictures and you can see but idk where can i send you the pictures. I really need help please. HB Team Hello darling. I def recommend following the steps I mentioned in this blog piece. It really helped me!! Also pay attention to your diet, and be patient. It took me around 6 months to recover mine. Xx Salma I made up my own concoction of oils‚Ä¶.avocado, coconut and castor oils with a few drops of rosemary essential oils. I use it mainly on my scalp to stimulate the growth which the rosemary does, and also nourishes the scalp which the remaining oils do. I also found a cheaper alternative to the densifique but can‚Äôt remember the name!! If your hair is falling from the roots rather than breaking off then you need to take iron supplements too as low blood serum iron levels contribute to hair loss. My hair is beginning to grow back and I have a ton of baby hairs sprouting everywhere! HB Team Thank you so much for the tip!

It‚Äôs seriously easy and it makes a BIG difference! It‚Äôs super simple! When you get out of the shower, immediately turn your head upside down and brush your hair all the way up (so that you look like an upside down treasure troll). Then tie your hair up and let it hair dry slightly so that the roots dry upwards. I use this time to do some errands! Then blow dry and style hair as usual for super voluminous hair!

Our lips don‚Äôt have any oil glands, and therefore have no way of replenishing themselves. That means it‚Äôs up to us to make sure these babies get all the moisture they need! It‚Äôs important to always carry a chap stick in your purse and to apply as needed. And remember, it doesn‚Äôt matter how expensive your lip product is, it‚Äôs the constant care that will make a difference and keep your lips from looking rough, and nothing is hot about peeling skin! Try this at-home lip scrub which will help fight dry lips. Lip Scrub: Ingredients: 1/4 cup sugar 3-5 drops peppermint oil 1 tablespoon honey 1 tablespoon olive oil In a bowl, mix together sugar, peppermint oil, honey and olive oil. Add water sparingly. You want to create a thick paste. Mix thoroughly. Take a warm wash cloth and hold over lips for 5 minutes. This will cause the dead skin to soften up. With your hand, take a small portion of the scrub and gently rub on lips in a circular motion. Do this for 1 minute. With the warm washcloth, wipe off scrub.Finish off by using your favorite lip moisturizer. image courtesy of arxbeauty artist at chap chapped cloth dry home honey lip Makeup natural oil olive peel peppermint remedy scrub service sugar wash water Sun, 23 May 2010 5 Comments Related Posts DIY Face Scrub for Glowing Skin!

It has become an indispensable part of my Beauty Mantra !! I love the way you write and your gorgeous self too !!! Thanks so much for your beauty regime secrets, I have just ordered the O H pack and cant wait to start it ! I have no such regieme i Just wash my face and go to bed, I am turning 25 this year and thought i should start something. The main help i wanted is that in the past year i have lost my glow and i want to get it back, my skin looks dull (and acne) how could i get some glow on my face back ?? Keep up the good work, you are truly inspiring ! &lt;3 you already üôÇ hudabeauty Aww Baby!!! You‚Äôre so sweet!! thank you soooooo much:) You have no idea how much your sweet words mean to me!! üôÇ You will looooove OH!! It‚Äôs amazing!!! The entire pack will help add that glow back to your skin, but also try the Blemish Attack roll on or gel. I love them both, but the roll on works better for me, it‚Äôs a bit stronger! I just put a slight (very very little) all over my face and I swear it keeps me from breaking out! My skin used to be sensitive to everything, now I can put anything on my face and I almost never break out (unless I forget to use it)! I hope it all helps baby and you have the best skin ever!

Let me know if you still can‚Äôt find it! Nadia No luck at Kitson either. They have a few Ole H. cleansers and toners but that‚Äôs about it.

Believe it or not, most of my favorite tips are super simple tips that require just a simple change in routine, but dramatically improve results! I have already confessed my love for how I get super voluminous blowouts , but I have received so many questions about breaking splitting hair that I felt compelled to share another easy but important trick for avoiding hair breakage! When our hair is wet, it is at it‚Äôs most fragile state. It breaks easily, can fall out more easily and quite frankly, our strands need a little TLC in the shower! The best way to care for your hair is before you get in the shower! Make sure you brush your hair completely so that you are 100% knot free! Try not to brush your hair at all the shower! I seriously couldn‚Äôt believe the difference in my hair when I started doing this. I noticed so much less fell out and I can imagine the difference it made on the quality of my hair! Super simple, yet soooo necessary! No Combing in the Shower (if possible)! image credits articlesbase beauty hair Hair Care health Makeup Wed, 16 Feb 2011 5 Comments Related Posts Why Your Water Could Be The Reason Your Hair Is Ratchet AF Sun, 29 Oct 2017 Could Sleeping With Your Hair Up Cause Hair Loss?

One of the issues I always have with drugstore conditioner is that they typically weight down my hair, so when I saw the Dove Weightless Nourishing Oil Care, I thought I would try it! I have seriously curly hair and I tend to be very picky with my hair masks since almost most products either weight it down or just don‚Äôt tame the frizz! I personally love the fact that there is no sulfate or parabans in the product and it has some great ingredients like coconut oil and sweet almond oil! I have to admit, after just a few times of using it, I‚Äôm impressed! I love the way it makes my hair feel super soft and incredibly conditioned! I actually left it in my hair for a few hours since I was a bit busy, but it still left my hair with a great amount of volume, although I always recommend avoiding your roots! The only thing which might bother some people is the fragrance is quite strong, even though it smells amazing! I find every store bought mask has pretty strong fragrance! beauty drugstore hair Sun, 1 Apr 2012 9 Comments Related Posts The Best Smelling Hair AND Body Oil You‚Äôll Ever Use Sat, 10 Jun 2017 My Curly Hair Routine And My Secret $5 Hair Mask Thu, 25 Jan 2018 Product Review: Hair Rehab with Ouai Hair Masques Tue, 1 Nov 2016 sana I have bleached and coloured my hair since I was 16 my hair is damaged and not healthy anymore I have used this mask OMG im lovinggggg this mask thank u soooo much huda xxx lulu Dear Huda, I feel that my hair isnt as thick as it was before,i Know that styling and colouring your hair have an effect on the thickness too. are there any hair masks that you recommend for it to grow thicker and healthier?

I actually love to wear a good amount on my cheeks no matter how much makeup I‚Äôm wearing! To me, it warms up your smile and makes you look MUCH healthier! I got a few questions about Dolce &amp; Gabbana‚Äôs Blushers and my top blushers of the moment! I know I did a post a while ago on my favorite blushes , but they have changes a bit (of course with new product launches, etc), soooo here are my new top favorite blushes of the moment! A few are from the older list, since I still love them!! üôÇ My Ultimate Fav : Dolce &amp; Gabbana‚Äôs Mauve Diamond Blush (I haven‚Äôt found anything that comes even close to being as amazing as this one), for some reason, it‚Äôs warm and cool, so it works no matter what look you‚Äôre going for, since it honestly looks like a natural flush My Favorite Warm Blush : Illamasqua‚Äôs Hussy ! I love this since it has a peach tone! It‚Äôs got to be the best peach toned blush ever created! My Favorite Natural Blush: Pinch Me from MAC, I love how this one literally looks sooo natural in color! It‚Äôs not strong, so this is great for every skin tone, but it looks great for that natural look! My Favorite Pink Blush: I looooove Pink Swoon from MAC! It‚Äôs such a soft pink and is great to use as a base for a more powerful blush! Sometimes I use different tones on my clients to create more dimension and a more natural finish! My Favorite Soft Blush : I love Melba from MAC as well and it‚Äôs great since it is peach in tone. It‚Äôs just as soft as pink swoon, only peach in tone and they actually work great together if you mix them! I also use this for contouring the eyebrow bone and it works lovely! My Favorite Cream Blush : Ok, I know I said 5, but I loooove Makeup Forever‚Äôs Cream Blush in #6 , it is AMAZING if you want to keep your makeup on for the whole day without reapplying it! I always use it first, then apply a powder blush on top! The only thing, the blush does dry up a little at the top of the pump, but the colors are AWESOME! beauty Makeup Sun, 1 Apr 2012 13 Comments Related Posts Beauty Glossary: Draping Mon, 3 Oct 2016 The Collection Which Left Us S-Peach-Less!

Hassani (@EnnHassani) Where exactly is the Hussy blush sold in Dubai? The last time I went to Areej in MOE it was sold out and Sephora doesn‚Äôt have that many Illamasqua products üôÅ Lola at Bloomingdales Dubai Mall üôÇ i loved it and the pigment is perfect but I think i wanna try the MUFE one.

I wasn‚Äôt looking for the most dramatic mascara, most lengthening, most voluminous, no! I was looking for the absolute darkest mascara known to man, and I do believe I have found it! There is nothing I love more than bold dark liner and mascara‚Äìit just makes everything seem so dramatic and beautiful! I love the way it looks from far away and up close! I literally tried every mascara I owned, which is an entire drawer labeled ‚Äúmascara‚Äù, filled with about 20+ mascaras I use at any given time (would be more if I didn‚Äôt throw them out so often, I hate expired makeup) and then went to Sephora to compare some more! The darkest mascara I found? I was pleasantry surprised with the L‚ÄôOreal Voluminous in Carbon Black. It beat all of my other mascara‚Äôs no matter what their price range or promise(came close to Smashbox Lash DNA)! I actually have this mascara in waterproof as well, and it‚Äôs definitely my fav! I don‚Äôt usually like waterproof makeup, but this mascara comes off quite easily, yet there is no flaking, or smudging, so I might just covert to waterproof for the time being. I will say, this is my favorite mascara to finish a look off. It doesn‚Äôt necessary provide volume the way the name might suggest. It‚Äôs much better used last to add some drama to the entire look and also seal everything in (since it‚Äôs waterproof). When I wear false lashes, this is the only mascara I use. However, on an everyday basis, I would start by using another mascara (right now I am using Giorgio Armani‚Äôs Eyes to Kill Excess, it gives you super feathery, yet dramatic lashes) then topping off the look with this! It adds the drama and depth your normal mascara might be lacking! I love it so much, I just bought three more today! image credits beautythesis beauty drugstore Makeup product Mon, 16 May 2011 7 Comments Related Posts This Drugstore Mascara Just Became My Go-To Mon, 4 Sep 2017 Extra Long Lashes With Cotton And Mascara?!

I was very disappointed when I saw that some of the winners didn‚Äôt even adhere to the rules and do the competition as per what was requested to do! I was even more upset to see that a brand so sincere like yours, didn‚Äôt even keep your word when it came to the recent competition you all had. I‚Äôm saying this because there are a couple of people who‚Äôve won but didn‚Äôt even repost the picture on time (before the 7th). This is really unfair to those who sincerely did the competition! There were sooo many people who entered the competition and did it according to the rules. I am such a BIG and loyal fan of you and the makeup empire you‚Äôve created but this really disheartened me.

POSTED A 1000TIMES AND IT WAS MY BIRTHDAY :(((((((((((( HUDAAAAAA PLEASE PLEASEEEEEEEEEEEEE DO SOMETHING Kk Omg stop blowing up her page. You didn‚Äôt win get over it. You should be thankful for all that she has done and stop harassing her. Anika CONGRATS WINNERS! i didn‚Äôt win but how exciting for those who did !! MaryamS You guys have wronged your followers. The contest stated that it ends Saturday Oct 7 midnight Dubai time, yet some people who were ‚Äúwinners‚Äù only posted AFTER it was over. @ka_94ox @glambysujitha @rabyazuberi @fiza_syed. These ‚Äúwinners‚Äù only posted 1 day ago. The contest was supposed to be over Saturday Oct 7th midnight Dubai time. Apparently you don‚Äôt need to follow rules to win. @_moonlightspirit @sarahjade_710 @anisa.k89n @anisha_nihaar @swe3tnectar also posted 2 days ago as well as before the contest ended. However if they were chosen from their most recent posts that is really not fair to the rest of the people who followed the rules. I unfollowed @hudabeauty and @shophudabeauty. I am never participating in your ‚Äúcontests‚Äù again because apparently rules don‚Äôt matter at all during the selection process. I‚Äôve entered every giveaway but never won once and now I know why. Thanks for nothing. Sincerely, Maryam Siddiqui HB Team Hi my love, a lot of people have deleted their posts since we announced the winners. We did the best we could to choose worthy winners, but as I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre aware, with thousands of people taking part, it‚Äôs very hard for us to be able to see every single entry, as we are only a very small team. Wishing you lots of luck for our next giveaway and thank you for all your support, it really means a lot to us. Lots of love xxxx Susan_Bonnie I still have my post on my page‚Ä¶. it‚Äôs very surreal for me that I didn‚Äôt make it, it‚Äôs HudaBeauty Makeup, I‚Äôm not giving up .. and I‚Äôm not taking them down any time soon until recognized Hanihere Hi huda The new winner @a.khan905, her sister has won the desert dusk pallette. Her Instagram id is @shaziakhan65. Kindly check the winners profile while announcing Huda, because you have many loving fans. It‚Äôs unfair for us. The people who have won previously win either the ones whose own sisters have won are being selected. They at least own a HB product, we don‚Äôt even do that. Madeeha Huda plz choose me as well. . I had so many expectations from all of your giveaways but I am not that lucky to win that. . . Whenever I take my mobile in my hands, my always first task is to see your profile. . you don‚Äôt have idea how many times I visit your profile and blog as well. . . I love your products so much but cannot purchase . . . Well congrats to all the winners Afsha Hi , no love she‚Äôs my cousin sister ,, and I have no right on her products ,, we both don‚Äôt even live together ,, but we are like bff and cousins sisters after all ,, for me this is my first time winning this giveaway ‚Ä¶. I have tried soo much , and I‚Äôm so happy HUDA has noticed me ‚Ä¶ And good luck for next time !! Don‚Äôt be disappointed I have tried a lot and now I have won !! Grace Can you do more giveaways it actually hurts so much that most of the people who won didn‚Äôt even put in any effort and the ones who did didn‚Äôt win like some people like me posted atleast 1000 times and it hurts to see people who posted once won I couldn‚Äôt even sleep properly 2 days. Your products are amazingggg and not everyone can afford them. The ones who can won as well. Some people don‚Äôt even need them. I believe you‚Äôre a great person and I love you sooo much you‚Äôre literally goals. Thank you for the opportunity tho Gigi.vi Lucky you ! Huda Beauty will be soon available in India! Check her latest posts üôÇ !!! Marina Luisa I really hoped to win, but I am so unlucky girl‚Ä¶. @hudabeauty I‚Äôm so sad‚Ä¶ i really love you so much and I did want all of this because I love you and I love all you do, all your makeup and I really hoped but it‚Äôs not my lucky day‚Ä¶ today‚Ä¶ maybe in the future ‚Ä¶ Princessnanita Well that sucks &lt;/3 Syeda Hi Huda and team. Just wanted to bring to your kind notice that @anisha_nihaar won your previous giveaway held in the end of May 2017 for 20 million followers. @anisa.k89n won the recent giveaway for the desert dusk pallette. @afifa_khan101 won @aviyr Huge Hudabeauty giveaway 2 weeks ago, you can also cross check with her as well. I think its really unfair with the other people who have posted many times just in the hope to win. All of them have won Hudabeauty products giveaways. So kindly look into my matter and also consider a new winner asap. Thanks and regards‚Ä¶ Atika I reposted that picture 1,810 (@akhtarparveen57)times and my sister reposted it 735(@ruqaiyya25), I find it so frustrating that people who only reposted it once got picked. I literally started posting on Tuesday and even did it during lessons and work. I understand 1000% that it‚Äôs a competition and people get picked at random, but I really thought my odds were higher and that I had a chance- it would have been nice to win. Shaheen M i m heartbroken.. even after reposting it 300+ tyms n commen≈•ing several no. Of tyms.. i didnot win‚Ä¶ i really put a lot of efforts 2 win dis giveaway ‚Ä¶ but still failed .. i participate in every hudabeauty giveaway but neva win.. layal123 IT WOULD BE AMAZINGGG if you would reply and cheer me up so I can have hope for another time to win üôÅ so sad omg!! but either way stilll love your brand and you will still be amazing and inspiring huda!!!! lots of love alwaysss!

I cannot wait to purchase this foundation when it releases! üôÇ Marian I think by you guys choosing a link to pick your winners is a little unfair. I understand there was thousands of entry‚Äôs but clicking on some of these names and seeing how they posted compared to my self and many others that actually reposted hundreds of times and put extra into the picture that was reposted Is disappointing. I bet half of those people who won probably followed this line because of the giveaway. I mean I went extra on my phone and so did many other fans. To do a giveaway this big to your fans should of been HAND PICKED if you guys saw how many times and how much effort this would be a whole different list. Just sad but anyways congratulations to the winners. Smh Afnan I agree so much with you! Vanessa Agreed I reposted this 2000 times and didn‚Äôt win Latoya Dear Hudie, can you do a foundation giveaway? I wish I can get a feel mainly of the foundation‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.not fussing about the entire collection even thought I don‚Äôt own a Huda beauty product because living here in the Caribbean makes it REALLY HARD to get her products. Nevertheless, I still love her, her brand and everything they stand for #TeamSnapchat Gigi.vi It‚Äôs really hard to hand pick thousands of commments‚Ä¶ randomly picking winners is a fair way! üôÇ I believe they have done their best! 30 winners is AAAAAmazing!!! Next time might the good one Azhar Wow you guys it‚Äôs a giveaway!! Her own products so just be happy for the winners and move on. Better luck next time to us all. If people constantly give Huda a hard time about these giveaways and how they‚Äôre so unfair she‚Äôll stop doing them. So be happy for your fellow winners and hopefully you win next time. Don‚Äôt turn something fun and exciting into a headache for the HudaBeauty team. Nuss I‚Äôm literally so sad!! I honestly thought I would win!! I reposted it so many times and also lost over a hundred followers. It‚Äôs so frustrating when I click on the winners names and they‚Äôve only reposted once. Clearly no effort was put Into it compared to the people that reposted over a thousand times. I‚Äôm suchha sad bunny just sitting here deleting the #hudabeautygiveaway posts from my page Afnan I feel you so much! I actually entered 1,778 times and had such high hopes to win and I couldn‚Äôt even sleep at all! I‚Äôm so sad honestly I‚Äôm so heart broken. Vanessa Me too! I lost so many followers and I posted this 2000 times I really thought the people who posted this so much would win considering it said you can enter multiple times well what was the point of sharing 2000 times and loosing half my followers to not win anything Sarahjst3 I only posted twice lovely and i didnt win either and ive entered other huda beauty competitions too and not won so dont let it dishearten you fingers crossed for next time and dont give up stay strong lifes too precious xxx Huda khan Em participating in every giveaway of urs but never won seriously being so crazy follower and fan of urs but now em jus dissapointed Leyla So Sad the same people win over And over again.

I understand 1000% that it‚Äôs a competition and people get picked at random, but I really thought my odds were higher and that I had a chance- it would have been nice to win. Mila I‚Äôm literally crying‚Ä¶I never won anything in my entire life so sad. Pearl How do you pick your winners? I tried so hard on both your giveaways. Never won. Congrats to the winners. I clicked on all these names and the last third name ( chrys_104) there did not work. If they don‚Äôt respond please contact me and I‚Äôll be more than happy and humble to accept anything extra. Mursnika Hudabeauty chrys_104 and dzzyzzle are the same account. Will you maybe give other a chance??

I‚Äôm actually waiting on the photos, but I was literally there for one whole day (believe it or not, that‚Äôs not my shortest trip)! While I was there I was SOOOOO excited to sit down with some amazing beauty editors from all over the world and lovely, amazingly talented Pat McGrath (who I LOOOVE so much) to talk about all the looks she created for all of her runway shows! One of her favorite products to use, which I also love is the Max Factor Masterpiece Eyeshadow ! I love this for soooo many reasons, but mostly because it literally doesn‚Äôt budge for hours! It‚Äôs probably one of the best products I‚Äôve ever used on my eyes to create crease-less shadow that blends with amazing pigment! Pat said she loved using the lighter one, which is more pearl in color! It looks like it would create a great highlighter as well, and considering it‚Äôs staying power, it‚Äôs probably one of the best products you can use for a gorgeous highlight that would last all day long! I just found it on the top of so many blogs and Allure Magazine ranks it as one of their best products at a bargain price! AMAZING!!! I have to say, I am really loving Max Factor/Covergirl lately!

It‚Äôs so awesome, I can‚Äôt get over it‚Äôs amazingness! The texture, the color, the lasting wear, it‚Äôs just all around one of the best liners ever! I thought maybe since the Bobbi Brown was more known and a department brand it would be better, I was wrong! LOVE this!!

Love you! Xx Sha I was initially using bobbi brown gel eyeliner. A friend recommended maybelline which was a third of the price. Tried it and never went back to bobbi brown. The small gel container lasts really long,compared to bobbi brown which dries up fast. Maybelline is smoother to apply as well Reem I went out and got all 3 Maybelline eye studio gel‚Äôs after watching your video .. My fav is the brown (u should try it), black then blue ! jihane morocco I love you so so so much that you look amazing kk Thanks Huda‚Ä¶. I have recently joined ur blog n lemme tell u Baby‚Ä¶ am addicted. Been using Maybelline eye studio for a while now. Very Happy my like for eyeliner is similar to urs üôÇ zuhra just got maybelline eyeliner. i think the brush is too thick. zuhra now i just love it! thanks darling! Neha Can you please do a tutorial on this look? Maha ur nailpolish! i love it salma thank you dear &lt;3 Gabriella Hey huda! Can you please tell me what blush and eyeshadow you‚Äôre wearing? Love your blog! Thank you XOXO hudabeauty Hi darling! It‚Äôs actually lipstick! I did this the same day I did my favorite pink lipsticks!! Check out the vid here! It shows what lipstick I used!! üôÇ Xxx S I loove this too . Its also only 40 AED and comes with the brush which is great üôÇ Thanks for the video alejandra U look absolutely amazing in the pics above! Can u do a tutorial on this look please! ThankS üôÇ lulu hey huda .. can you please tell me what lashes you are using ? i dont seem to get the right ones for me thanks xx Neha Hi Huda! Can you tell me what eye shadows you‚Äôre wearing? üôÇ Strawberry hi huda, i‚Äôve always been wondering‚Ä¶what eyelashes do usually have on? not the ones u have on in this video, but the ones that are always on in most of ur recent pictures. üôÇ Mary Monroe I purchased the bobbie brown gel liner because you recommended it but i have to say it isn‚Äôt the best at lasting long‚Ä¶ I haven‚Äôt tried any other gel liner but i will grab this up sounds great.. You look so pretty love your makeup really enjoyed this product review video you should make more often. I wanted to suggest that maybe you could show us your beauty room üôÇ I‚Äôm in desperate need for a makeup organizer and the only one i Loveee is the acrylic clear cube makeup organizer idk where to find like the one seen on the kardashian episodes.. any clue? Hanan Huda what do you think of the BE Buxom gel liner? I love that it has natural stuff in it and promotes lash growth. I think it worked for me. And it‚Äôs super black which I love! I tried to love Bobbi Brown‚Äôs liner but kept going back to buxom. Will give Maybelline a try though now! (Though BE would still win in my book for everyday use because it‚Äôs ‚Äòsupposed‚Äô to be chemical free.) Hafsa Issa-Salwe I like the Maybelline liner but I‚Äôve found it to dry out a little and I find myself having to dip the brush into the gel twice to get the whole lid covered. But I do agree about it being better than the Bobbi Brown liner and it‚Äôs super cheap! emo0o0o0oz put it in microwave to heat it up or in hot water ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶sometimes i use eyesealer too üòõ the worst gel liner is makeup forever gel liner‚Ä¶.i HATE it!! Hanan Agreed! I thought I was the only one that hated MUFE gel liner. It dried up a month after I opened it, the color faded throughout the day even though it was waterproof. Dee Hi Huda! Love your site!! Can you please post something on makeup storage or organization? I would love to know the techniques you use to organize your makeup. www.khaleejikat.blogspot.com Thanks for doing this one. I have the Maybelline one and like it although I did keep wondering if the Bobbi Brown one was just that little bit better. Good to know the Maybelline one is just as good! I also love Maybelline mascara ‚Äì although the Max Factor one you reviewed a few weeks back I have now got and love ‚Äì it reminds me a bit of the Dior Show (the original one) Thanks.

I don‚Äôt like it when makeup removers take forever to remove makeup, especially when you use some pretty heavy duty professional makeup! When I got the Nivea Double Effect Makeup Remover I wasn‚Äôt sure if it would really remove my super hard to remove waterproof makeup, but did it ever! If you shake the bottle well, this makeup remover will take off literally all of your makeup. To be honest, when I don‚Äôt shake it well, it still does a seriously good job, but when you shake it up, it‚Äôs pretty much the best eye makeup remover! I was really impressed because it definitely compares to my more expensive eye makeup removers (Chanel and Lancome are my favs) and it‚Äôs awesome to find something this effective at such a great price! Definitely impressed!! An awesome product!!

Not only do I look for pigment, but also the right tone that brings out our natural flush and as well as one that lasts all day! Now I know I‚Äôve preached about Hussy and I can‚Äôt tell you how many of you have written me telling me you are obsessed with it, but I did find a blush that just brings out the best for this seasons‚Äô trends! Flushed cheeks are so hot this season and nothing, absolutely nothing is better than Dolce &amp; Gabbana‚Äôs Mauve Diamond blush ! I have been using it since it came out and I love the way it looks on! It works for all of my clients no matter how fair or dark and is just the perfect amount of pink! I‚Äôm completely obsessed with this blush! It‚Äôs limited edition, so make sure you get it while you can! I have two (one for my kit and one for myself) and I love it so much, I think I might get another! üôÇ beauty cosmetics Tue, 29 Nov 2011 6 Comments Related Posts Beauty Glossary: Draping Mon, 3 Oct 2016 NARSissist‚Äôs Unfiltered Cheek Palettes ‚Äì‚Ä¶ Mon, 24 Apr 2017 On the Go: Tarte x Styled by Hrush Palette Sun, 30 Oct 2016 Janine wowsers, loooove that blush on you! what lipgloss are you wearing in the headband pic??

So far I‚Äôm on my 3rd treatment session, and I have seen great results. The redness and scaring are getting lighter and lighter, however I did flake for about 4 days after each treatment so I just avoid putting any kind of makeup on during the aftermath. My makeup seems to go on better and my skin overall seems to look a lot healthier. I definitely recommend it. I was told I can need up to 6 sessions, I dont mind it since people around me are also seeing this drastic difference.</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>Friday Favs | Gorgeously Flawless Skin!!

But there‚Äôs good reason for it ‚Äì girl knows beauty. Understandably, when she partnered up with Tarte to come out with her own mini-palette, it sold out quicker than you can say Styled by Hrush. Good news is, you can still purchase it at Ulta.com. Here‚Äôs what we thought about her limited-edition palette: What it is : A palette co-created with celebrity makeup artist Hrush Achemyan containing three shimmery shades (including a limited-edition white gold one), three matte shadows, and one peachy-pink blush. What we liked : We loved the pigmented colors that you can use matte for a sophisticated day time look, or blend with the lusters to amp it up as a liner or shadows for an evening look. The colors are a universally-flattering combo for all-over, crease, and highlight shades. We love to use the peachy ‚ÄúPinch‚Äù for everyday, the brown ‚ÄúKitty‚Äù for our crease, and the decadent ‚ÄúRoyal‚Äù purple as a hint of liner. The shimmery ‚ÄúBliss‚Äù and ‚ÄúSmitten‚Äù add a nice pop of bling that‚Äôs so very Hrush. Not to mention, a peachy-pink blusher that gives us the prettiest flush to our cheeks. It has personality, with still very wearable colors. The size is perfect to throw in your purse ‚Äî the sleek faux-crocodile leather embossed cover even makes it look like a mini-wallet.

The different types of fashion is reflections of all the different cultures blended. You‚Äôll see kids in acid wash skinny jeans w/ vans, and a wooden cross around their neck.. or guys in chinos and converse. Then, you‚Äôll walk down the street and see girl‚Äôs with sky scraper heels, snake skin mini skirts, and neon tops.. or boho girl‚Äôs w/ sun dresses, nude sandals, and a scarf around their head! It‚Äôs amazing what you‚Äôll see, and how confident everyone seems to be in what they are wearing (even if it looks completely ridiculous)! Roxanne Madrid I‚Äôve only been to LA once for business.

There are more things about LA that I adore than I could possibly put into one readable article, so I will limit myself to the things that keep me coming back. The three things LA just blows every other city in the USA out of the water with are ‚Äì convenience, culture, and beauty. Another great thing about LA is that it‚Äôs centrally located to virtually everything: You want the beach, drive a max of 30 mins and the ocean‚Äôs right there for you. You want amusement parks? Drive an hour tops, and you‚Äôve got Six Flags, Disneyland, and Knotts. You want snow? Again, drive an hour to the mountains, and you‚Äôve got it. LA‚Äôs also got a multitude of museums for the ones who love to learn, and then‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs the night life. Basically, everything you could ever want and need is in LA. You just can‚Äôt stop loving it ! Elsa El Osta email : elsaelosta@yahoo.com Marissa Vishnu Hello Beauty, I love LA ESP for the ambiance and of course there‚Äôs the best shopping!!!

Sejuti I love LA because, when i walk through the streets of LA, i get so much inspiration by seeing all the different types of people and their unique styles. Its not as up beat and fast as NYC, but it has its own relaxed and calm vibe which makes me feel content and comfortable in my own skin.

Sabrina I love LA because there‚Äôs lots to do there; fun in the sun. LA is also a shopper‚Äôs paradise &amp; my credit card needs to be dented üòâ IslandEye Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I love where I‚Äôm from (Hawaii). But I have to say that I love LA because it‚Äôs a beautiful juxtaposition of cosmopolitan and a Pacific laid-back coastal attitude. You can stuff your face with Korean Tacos downtown, hit up the craziest clubs in West Hollywood, attend a red carpet event, and still relax at the beach in Malibu, or people watch in colorful Venice Beach. ‚Äú‚Ä¶LA, it‚Äôs the place to be. You‚Äôve got to be there to know it, what everybody wanna see.‚Äù Sara I am very excited to hear about the West LA Boutique in Dubai. I was going to buy a beauty blender look alike from sephora this weekend, but pleased to know I could purchase the actual thing now. Thank you Huda xoxox Sara I love LA bc the fashion is boho chic and its the home to all celebrities nasreen I love La because the vibe there is so relaxed maheenhaider Best brand in town .. simple and elegant .. üôÇ as per your requirement thats y i love LA.</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>CONTEST TIME!!

The newest addition to Chanel‚Äôs fabulous collection of fragrances, Coco Chanel Noir is INSANELY delicious ! It‚Äôs such a great way to head into fall, and honestly I will be wearing this alll year round! It‚Äôs definitely one of the spicier fragrances from Chanel and at first, I thought it was a mens cologne, but after I sprayed it on, I was in love!! It lingers so beautifully! It‚Äôs definitely a very sophisticated and beautiful fragrance, I am reeeally loving this one! This one will be a classic!

REVIEW | SKIN By Huda Heidi Kattan When it comes to Drugstore Brands, there are a few brands that just seem to deliver time and time again! One of them is DEFINITELY Bioderma! I had heard from friends that it was amazing, but it wasn‚Äôt until I had a baby, that I tried it ( since it is VERY baby friendly, which means it‚Äôs very natural) ! This week my hubby had a slightly heavy work week which means he broke out a little! I am a little embarrassed to admit this, but while he was sleeping I put some of the Bioderma Sebium Masque on his breakouts and left him. When he woke up the first thing he said was ‚Äúdid you put something on my face last night?‚Äù He couldn‚Äôt be mad since his breakouts were sooo much better, and by better I mean some were gone and others were almost gone! This mask is AWESOME!! I t basically works by controlling the levels at which our sebaceous glands release oils and keeps them clear ! The entire sebium line from Bioderma is pretty amazing and so far this is my FAVORITE drugstore acne mask!

Do you have any super fast treatment for acne scars and discoloration too? SOS, help anyone? Ms Maca You should really try NeoStrata brand. Dermatologist prescribed it to me and it works really well. You should initially have few breakouts, even maybe peel little, until you skin adjusts (3 weeks). You should use it only at night and little goes a long way. If you put too much, you will peel. newmom Hi ! i had really bad acne that left bad scars , i tried so many products from cheap to expensive and i wasn t happy at all till i tried CAUDALIE it s a french line , i ve been using it for more than a year , i m very happy with the results , my scars started to go away which is amazing as they were pretty bad even full coverage foundation wasn t helping to cover them‚Ä¶ http://www.caudalie-usa.com/face/radiance-anti-dark-spot-vinoperfect.html I ll recommend this line to family and friends.

You see my hair is so thin and flat and fine it makes me very uncomfortable. My husband even started to take notice and it makes me feel ugly‚Ä¶.please help you are my beauty icon Hi darling! You are sooo sweet and trust me, if you see me first thing in the morning you‚Äôll know that I am NO beauty icon! We‚Äôre all the same, some of us just have some tricks up our sleeves, which is why I‚Äôm here:)) Darling I have the same exact problem! My hair may seem thick, but it is soooooo NOT! It‚Äôs sparse, my head is small, (I always have to buy extra small hats, which means if your head is small, your hair will look thinner) and I‚Äôm pretty sure I was balding at one point. Don‚Äôt worry, I can help!! Here are my best tips for giving your hair the volume you‚Äôve always wanted!! I hope they help darling!! :)) Biotin is your friend! Biotin has done WONDERS for not only my hair but also my clients and friends! Ok, don‚Äôt expect a miracle, but you can expect your hair to look anywhere from 10-30% thicker which in my book is pretty awesome! Use Volumizing Hair Masks! There will always be some ingredients that naturally give your hair natural volume! One of my FAVORITE things in nature is apple cider vinegar and one of my favorite ways to use it is in my hair! There are so many hair masks that you can use to give your hair serious bounce! Might sound crazy, but keep your hair on the Dry Side! Hair that is too oily or shiny is flat. Quite frankly it‚Äôs hard to have volume and shiny hair, but you can always keep your ends slightly glossy and your roots a bit more clean. I like to use dry shampoo after I fix my hair and it really helps give my hair volume! Tease, Tease, TEASE! Teasing your hair is a MUST! Every celebrity does it and it makes such a HUGE difference, literally! I always tease before I go out to an important event, but sometimes at home I just do the back a bit and it makes my hair look alive! I love teasing with a tooth brush, it‚Äôs my favorite thing to use! Check out the difference in these photos when I have no teasing vs mega teasing! Use Volumizers! Volumizers are Awwwwwsome!! I love them! I love blow drying my hair, then using a volumizer all over! I flip my hair upside down and blow dry it after I apply it and it helps boosts my hair to serious height! 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2012 acne al alanoud algabbani alya anoud arab arabia arabic artist baby badr bazaar beautiful beauty beauty blog beauty blogger beautyblogger before beyonce blog blogger botox british buy camilla coehlo carli bybel cheek color contest dalia decay dogmoch Dubai east eyebrows Fashion fillers freebies gabbani gaga get Giveaway habtoor hair harpers homeopathic homeopathy how huda hudabeauty jennifer job johnson kandee kardashian kattan kim lady lashes lina lipgloss lips lopez louis Makeup michelle phan middle mohamed mona naked natural nichols nose noura nude palette plastic recipe rihanna Samman saudi sephora sexy soubra sultan surgery Tala tamara to top Tutorial uae urban wedding where woman women Youtube Mon, 17 Sep 2012 21 Comments Related Posts My New Secret Weapon: Dallas Thickening Spray Sun, 22 Jan 2017 Recovering Your Hair‚Ä¶On a Budget!

Will really appreciate it. NardeenMarkos I‚Äôve been using a supplement called Perfectile for Skin, Hair and Nail for over 2 months now and I noticed a big change in my hair loss.

Whats the limit of taking biotin? How many mcg? And how much do you take?

I dont really want to be taking both and I am really confused!! thanks for your help! üôÇ sheela yes huda please tell me what to do with the vinegar smelling afterwards? even after rinsing? plzzzzzzzzzz answer xxx hudabeauty Hi darling! I always rinse with water! I typically use less vinegar! Sometimes I only use a little and dilute it with water, I know the smell is terrible, but it only lasts a while if you dilute it with water! MakeUpNaive I have tried the apple cider vinegar hair rinse and boy was it awesome!! My only concern is the stink even after i rinse it with cold H2O and some say it will lighten your hair color so i stopped using, is their anything to solve this issue because i really love this! Ditto on the hair teasing, can you do a video tut on how is it done using the toothbrush PLEASE? Much appreciated, thanks hudabeauty You got it! üôÇ BeautyGlam These are some seriously awesome and very helpful tips! Thanks a bunch!

I personally take Biotin every day and I do take it with my Fish Oil and it‚Äôs fine. If you are worried about anything, you can always speak to your doctor! üôÇ paigesalexander Hi Huda. I am new to your blog, and LOVE IT!!! Thanks for all of the beauty advice. Do you think the apple cider vinegar mask is safe for colored hair? Also, could you give some pointers on exactly HOW you tease with a toothbrush?? Thanks so much Paige hudabeauty Doing a video!

Huda I feel I have a problem and I hope you can aid me with a way to get rid of the issue I have with my blackheads. My pores are very big and I feel so unsure about them‚Ä¶I hate the way I look in the photo because of them and I really need your help! I want to know if I can do extraction myself? I love you Huda and I am huge fan of yours, so I hope you can help me !! Hi sweetheart!!! Awww babe, you are sooo undeniably adorable! üôÇ OMG! Pores!! Ugh! The thought of them makes my stomach turn! I typically take extra good care of my pores, but when I don‚Äôt‚Äîahhhh, the BLOW up! I don‚Äôt recommend doing at home extraction, simply for the reason that it is very easy to damage our skin and you could cause some of your veins to become very obvious if you put enough strain on your capillaries. One of the things I love to when is a clay mask! Clay is sooo awesome for pulling out any impurities and it almost works like a magnet, scratch that, it completely works like a magnet and pulls out all of the yucky sebum and dirt in our pores to reveal beautiful skin! There are some awesome ready to use clay masks out there if you don‚Äôt want to do it at home! If you don‚Äôt like the idea of putting clay on your face (although, I highly recommend it), you can always try very natural remedies such as using lemon juice. Try using a cotton bud to saturate your face with fresh squeezed lemon juice. Let the juice sit over night and wash off in the morning. The acidity levels in the lemon juice help loosen up the dirt and will help remove the blackheads over a few nights. I hope these tips helped!!! Good luck darling!!! &lt;3&lt;3 at home beauty diy Makeup natural Tue, 12 Jul 2011 7 Comments Related Posts The Best DIY Face Masks For Oily Skin Mon, 6 Nov 2017 This Insta-Famous Face Mask Is Actually The Easiest DIY Mon, 23 Oct 2017 Get VDay Glamorous!

But there‚Äôs good reason for it ‚Äì girl knows beauty. Understandably, when she partnered up with Tarte to come out with her own mini-palette, it sold out quicker than you can say Styled by Hrush. Good news is, you can still purchase it at Ulta.com. Here‚Äôs what we thought about her limited-edition palette: What it is : A palette co-created with celebrity makeup artist Hrush Achemyan containing three shimmery shades (including a limited-edition white gold one), three matte shadows, and one peachy-pink blush. What we liked : We loved the pigmented colors that you can use matte for a sophisticated day time look, or blend with the lusters to amp it up as a liner or shadows for an evening look. The colors are a universally-flattering combo for all-over, crease, and highlight shades. We love to use the peachy ‚ÄúPinch‚Äù for everyday, the brown ‚ÄúKitty‚Äù for our crease, and the decadent ‚ÄúRoyal‚Äù purple as a hint of liner. The shimmery ‚ÄúBliss‚Äù and ‚ÄúSmitten‚Äù add a nice pop of bling that‚Äôs so very Hrush. Not to mention, a peachy-pink blusher that gives us the prettiest flush to our cheeks.

Whichever way you may have come across her, one thing we can all agree on is Hrush Achemyan gives good brow.

While in Dubai to celebrate the launch, we caught up with Hrush about some of her makeup tips and the surprising things you might find in her purse. Read on! Why was it so important for you to collaborate with a brand like Make Up For Ever? It‚Äôs exciting! I was extremely honored that a brand which, when I started off as a makeup artist would have died to have the whole collection, actually asked me to collaborate with them on something I‚Äôm obsessed with. I have such bushy brows myself and I used to be made fun of for them for so long, and now it‚Äôs the it-trend. It‚Äôs like, look at me now! I‚Äôm just so obsessed with eyebrows. It was really a no-brainer for me to get on board. What are your tips for making brows look fuller? A new product that Make Up For Ever launched is the Brow Liquid Liner. You can fake extra hair if you use it properly. It adds the look of texture. The Aqua Brow for me though is what really attracted me to brand in the first place. I like to use it to lighten my eyebrows because they‚Äôre so aggressive looking. It‚Äôs actually what got me on to first using brow products. Who in your opinion has the nicest brows right now? Cara Delevingne! If we look in your purse right now, what are three things we‚Äôd find? You‚Äôre going to find a mini Sriracha bottle on a keychain‚Ä¶I‚Äôm not joking! You‚Äôll probably find Chapstick, and I always carry a brush for my brows because if someone touches or rubs my face, one eyebrow goes down, so I have to brush it up again. Being based in LA and visiting the Middle East, what do you think is the biggest difference between beauty in both places? The Middle East loves black and I love that a woman feels so confident with her face. Girls in the U.S. like to glam, don‚Äôt get me wrong, even if they‚Äôre a little more low-key about it. I just believe wherever you are in the world whether from the U.S. or Middle East, with anything you wear if you wear it with confidence, you‚Äôre going to slay.</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>b567f1dc28d57c71eca7f575b41352595a40b48d</string></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>3ce7-4506-aac4</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>hrush achemyan</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>http://hudabeauty.com/tag/hrush-achemyan/</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>in product review On the Go: Tarte x Styled by Hrush Palette by HB Team Sun, 30 Oct 2016 Leave a comment We haven‚Äôt made our affections for makeup artist Hrush a secret.

If you haven‚Äôt realized it yet and it‚Äôs pretty obvious, this gorgeous goddess was destined for fame. In her short time she has opened several companies, launched numerous products and is endorsing everything from makeup to salads. Let‚Äôs face it, whether you love her or love to hate her, she is hot. Just how hot? She has been regarded as one of the hottest women in Hollywood. After meeting her in LA, I realized the dazzlising dash-doll is just as sweet as she is sweetfaced. From impeccable style, to a killer bod, Kimmy K is here to stay. RESPECT!! She will be releasing two calenders next year, one as a blond and one as a brunette. Here are some sneak peaks from her 2011 calender as a brunette.

So the other day I Instagramed this picture with the caption ‚ÄúJust found a new #hair product that made my hair faboush!!! Love it‚Äù and now I am DYING to tell you guys about this product! I recently went through a phase where I bought every body-building hair product I could get my hands on! Some worked, but most didn‚Äôt! One product that worked incredibly well on my hair, was actually one that my BFF Candy has been obsessed with! The TIGI Superstar Queen for a Day Body Building Spray is AhhhMAZING!!! Ok, honestly it definitely makes your hair look a little dull and less shiny, but the volume this product gives on your hair‚Äìit‚Äôs like multiplying it by two! I applied to it to air dried hair, then blow dried and curled with a curling iron, the results, gorgeous salon hair! I do believe this product just works better on dry hair, so I recommend applying it to at least semi dry hair before a blow dry!

Of course being beauty bloggers, many of them had their own natural remedies! I was so shocked to find out that a few of them contributed their perfect skin to two things, Green Tea and Rose Water! I recently posted about how amazing Green Tea is and I have personally seen amazing improvements in my skin when I drink regularly, but Rose Water is something I am definitely getting more into! I actually love this recipe for a natural DIY Rose Water Spray! It‚Äôs super easy and you can use it as needed! This is great for stabilizing skin, especially oily skin! It also helps keep your skin flawless and if you have any blemishes or open wounds (including from acne or sunburn) this is awesome to help cool and heal!

And by clean, I mean really clean! Most of our pores are full of oils and dirt from not only fro what we put onto our faces, but also from things in our environment. Until you have a serious cleaning, you don‚Äôt realize how dirt your skin really is! This recipe for a simple microdermabrasion at home is great for oily skin or to combat breakouts! All you need to do is mix equal parts of nutmeg and milk together, while rubbing on your skin! Nutmeg is awesome at scrubbing our skin clean and getting rid of excess oils, while the milk is AMAZING at removing dead layers of skin! I love this recipe!

Of course everyone‚Äôs skin will react differently, but if you are looking for radiantly soft, even toned, beautiful skin without blackheads, I may just have something for you! And it‚Äôs probably one of the easiest facials I have done! All you have to do is take a good portion of baking soda (I used about 3 tablespoons) and mix in enough grapefruit juice to get a loose pasty texture. Then just rub on your skin, starting from your nose out to your forehead, cheeks and neck! You can let this sit for a couple minutes before rinsing, but your skin will feel soooo soft! Why is this sooo awesome? Well aside from the way it makes your skin feel, grapefruit is Ahhhhmazing at clarifying and toning your skin and is one of the best fruits to help fight acne! It‚Äôs high quantities of vitamin C means it helps reduce the signs of aging, scarring and anything else that is keeping you from perfect skin! I also love the way it smells and it reminds me of my favorite acne body wash , but at home (which means it‚Äôs awesome). This facial scrub is ideal for people of oily/normal skin or acne prone skin! Try this and let me know how much you love it! If you have skin allergies, be careful since grapefruit is acidic and can cause reactions.

The most beautiful, I don‚Äôt know! I think that‚Äôs a really hard title to give someone! Who do you guys think is the most beautiful person in the world? I honestly can‚Äôt pick just one! If I had to pick one, it would be between Salma Hayek, Scarlett Johansson, Heifa Wehbe (I‚Äôve always thought she was gorgeous, even though she may not be the most natural), Sanaa Lathan and Priyanka Chopra!

Uh she is attractive and elegent Reem Haifa Wahbe are you serious? She‚Äôs so fake ! So dissapointed u picked her ! FleursSauvages I think it‚Äôs great that an African-American woman has again been chosen (the last was 9 or so years ago). The idea of ‚Äúbeauty‚Äù needs to be expanded to include women of all skin tones, body types, hair types, etc. Let‚Äôs celebrate the beautiful characteristics of all women!! I look forward to an ever-diversified lsit of women in years to come‚Ä¶ ArchiTah I don agree at all‚Ä¶How can they say most beautiful woman in the world? # 1: they have not seen all women in the world and pick Beyonce out of them..#2: I think ‚Äúbeauty‚Äù as perceived by many people has become materialistic..how? just think of the amount of money people like Beyonce would spend to get such looks‚Ä¶these are normal people who were lucky enough to buy whats nowadays called ‚Äúbeauty‚Äù‚Ä¶.I think any woman who is confident and doing what she loves to do is beautiful and Beyonce could be one of them‚Ä¶and there is no most beautiful woman in the world!!!! Jadebella I don‚Äôt agree with naming them the most beautiful people of the world‚Ä¶ There‚Äôs Alot of regular people who are if not more gorgeous than celebrities!!! zuhra Charlize Theron &amp; Monica Bellucci! i love their beauty. Sahar Adriana Lima hands down. Sorry but almost all celebrities have plastic surgery. B Priyanka Chopra is plastic-surgeried through and through!!! Beyonce is definitely one of the most beautiful along with eva longoria, penelope cruz, angelina jolie‚Ä¶ok i could go on forever lol Mary Monroe I agree I couldn‚Äôt just pick one‚Ä¶.

You may already know how obsessed I am with beauty DIYs, so I thought I‚Äôd round up some of my favorite (and inexpensive!) beauty remedies that is as close as your kitchen cabinet. Some of these things work even better than the most expensive products, so I picked out some of my trusted ingredients, like coconut oil, apple cider vinegar, aspirin, and potatoes to do a video on how you can use each of these to be even more gorgeous. I really hope you guys enjoy watching this video and please leave me comments on any beauty DIYs that you guys LOVE! Maybe I can do another video and include some :). Thank you so much for watching! Xx RECAP: ASPIRIN ‚Äì Smash an aspirin (preferably one with vitamin C‚Ä¶if not, just add a little lemon juice). Add to a glass with a little water and dab on any acne spots. It has salicylic acid that helps dry out acne. COCONUT OIL ‚Äì Take a tablespoon of coconut oil, warm until it‚Äôs liquifies and coat hair overnight. Wash out in the morning to add hydration to hair. LEMON ‚Äì Slice a lemon in half, top with brown sugar and use to exfoliate dark areas like your elbow and knees. Helps to exfoliate naturally. You can use on your face to minimize pores. GARLIC ‚Äì An amazing anti-fungal for nails! Also keeps it clear, white, and beautiful. It also helps to strengthen nail. Just slice half a clove of garlic and place in a bottle of clear nail polish. Apply to nails often to help strengthen them. POTATOES ‚Äì Slice in half and rub where you need to lighten, like underarms, knees, elbows, and even under eyes (you can slice thinner slices for the eyes). APPLE CIDER VINEGAR ‚Äì I put a couple drops in a bottle of water and rinse after shampoo and conditioner for INSANE shine. Also amazing to get rid of any lingering residue from products. The only thing is if you had your hair recently coloured, keep in mind it can lighten in. For skin, it‚Äôs amazing at managing the pH levels of skin. Combine equal parts water and ACV, and dip in a cotton pad to rub on skin. HONEY ‚Äì A super humectant! Whenever my lips are feeling chapped or red, I apply a little honey to soothe and calm my skin. TURMERIC ‚Äì A great anti-inflammatory for skin! A great facial mask I like to use is combine coconut oil, honey, and pinch of turmeric until pastey and apply on skin. Leave it on for a few minutes, and rinse off with warm water. in product review Weekend Fragrance | Sweet &amp; Exotic Indulgence! by hudabeauty Sat, 31 Mar 2012 9 Comments PRODUCT REVIEW | FRAGRANCE By Huda Heidi Kattan Fragrance is something NOOOO beauty junkie can live without and personally, I always look for something that leaves everyone wanting more!

I for one, am incredibly critical of myself. In fact, I simply don‚Äôt believe it when people tell me I am beautiful or attractive. I am quite certain that many of the women who are regarded as the most beautiful in the world, feel the same. Why? Because we are way too hard on ourselves. I love this new campaign called Operational Beauty , where you leave notes for women in random places like the bathroom, powder rooms, etc. with messages that say things like ‚ÄúSmile, you are beautiful‚Äù. I just think it‚Äôs adorable! Even if we don‚Äôt want to leave a note, I think it‚Äôs important to encourage each others confidence and let your BFF, sister, or colleague know, she‚Äôs beautiful, just the way she is! image credits operationalbeautiful beautiful beauty campaign health hollywood House Beautiful Magazines and E-zines natural new operational People vitamin women Tue, 12 Oct 2010 5 Comments Related Posts HB Love: Women‚Äôs Day!

I‚Äôve literally tried it all: dunking my face in water to set my makeup , Vagisil as a makeup primer , you name it, I‚Äôve probably tested it. The ingredient that I‚Äôve been majorly crushing on for a few years, but which still isn‚Äôt widely recognized for its supernatural properties, is snail slime (call it mucus, mucin, secretion‚Äì it‚Äôs the same stuff!). Snail secretion (Ewww, I know!) is incredibly beneficial for your skin in so many ways: It can help fade acne scars, revitalize your skin, clear your complexion, and give your skin an insanely gorgeous glow. Its impressive regenerative properties were discovered 20 years ago when Chilean snail farmers found that their hands were incredibly soft, looked younger, and even their scars disappeared after handling snails on a daily basis. The origins of snail mucus in beauty go as far back as Greek physician Hippocrates, who would recommend crushed snails for healing inflamed skin. Picking up on the phenomenon, Korean beauty brands did what they do best, and turned snail mucin into a ton of awesome beauty products. Wondering why it‚Äôs so good? Snail mucus is packed with nutrients and antioxidants, including hyaluronic acid, which is a key ingredient for reviving skin‚Äôs moisture levels. The intense hydration plumps and softens your skin (50% of your body‚Äôs hyaluronic acid is found in your skin), and generally wards away the signs of ageing like a slimy fairy godmother. Snail mucus is also rich in a ton of other ingredients that beauty brands use, including copper peptides, which help to stimulate collagen and elastin production. Before you rush outside to find the closest garden snail to smother on your face (I doubt you would!), you‚Äôll be pleased to know that the snail slime used in cosmetic products is carefully controlled, and goes through an intense filtration process to make sure the slime is pure and concentrated. Fortunately, beauty brands do the hard work for us and turn the snail mucus into amazing products that we can use, from moisturizers and lip balms, to face masks, firming creams and cleansing gels. My FAV snail ingredient product is without a doubt, the Tony Moly Intense Care Snail Gold 24k Hydrogel Mask ( check out my review ), which absolutely proved to me snail slime really can make a huge difference to your skin (I never thought I‚Äôd say that!). Tony Moly also has a load of snail products I‚Äôve tried and loved, and some more I‚Äôve just discovered that I can‚Äôt wait to try. What do you guys think, would you be happy to try snail slime products?

HB Team Hi my love, try doing a small test patch on your inner arm or neck first and see how it reacts to your skin before you put it on your face. If there‚Äôs no irritation or redness you should be okay. xx Tavia The Ordinary has bottles of this stuff for a really reasonable price and its an amazing company!

It made my skin reaalllyyy soft and hydrated! There are some brands who make moisturizers with snail extracts as well.
