We‚Äôre in the home stretch! Naturally, I will not have ALL the brands in the market for this head to head comparisons ‚Äì Korean brands aren‚Äôt all that generous at providing samples, unlike the Western brands I worked with before this ‚Äì but I have enough to take you through 7 (yes, count that) SEVEN days of Cushion Foundations. This time, we will have a whole WEEK of cushions and then on Day 8 (if I have not yet collapsed from exhaustion), I‚Äôll give you a round up, and on Day 9 (Yes, I‚Äôve thought this through) I‚Äôll do you a quick comparison of Korean vs Western brand cushions based on what I‚Äôve tested so far. Whew! There‚Äôs a lot to get through so, fasten your seatbelts, here we go! When I showed you my favouritest cushion foundation , I received rumblings of ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs so expensive!‚Äù Hey guys, this can‚Äôt possibly be your first visit to MWS, can it? You come to MWS for the expensive stuff, don‚Äôt you?! üòõ LOL! But happily for some of you, here‚Äôs one that I quite like (it falls a few steps short of being No. 1 on my list) Day 5 of Cushion Foundation Week 2 (the K-Beauty edition) is a the more affordable Mamonde Cover Powder Cushion , a brand that‚Äôs just entered our beauty scene just last month! Cushion Foundation: Mamonde Cover Powder Cushion SPF50+ PA+++ Mamonde is a new and fairly affordable brand under the Amore Pacific umbrella, having flowers as the source of its brand story, and has just been made available in Malaysia in August 2016. Incidentally, this product is the very first product I‚Äôve tried from the brand! Apparently, this brand and its Cover Powder Cushion has a lot of raves due to the popularity of the Mamonde ambassador, Korean actress Park Shin Hye. (Please don‚Äôt ask me who she is. I have no freaking idea. I may use the occasional Korean skincare or makeup product, but the whole K-pop scene eludes me. If you are a fan of K-dramas you‚Äôd likely already know who she is) Anyway, according to Mamonde, this Cover Powder Cushion is supposed to make skin look light and bright, like you‚Äôre walking around with your own personal reflector board. Now, wouldn‚Äôt that be nice? I‚Äôd like my own photographer by my side as well, please üòõ Mamonde also intentionally made their cushion foundation with higher coverage and concealer ingredients, so if sheer cushions aren‚Äôt your thing (they aren‚Äôt mine) then this is one you should be looking for! Sunscreen protection : SPF50+ PA+++ I‚Äôm not sure why I kept this section in, because all Korean Cushion foundations come with high SPF rating. That said, if you‚Äôre using a cushion foundation in place of sunscreen , come, let me smack you üòõ However, what is good about cushion foundations, is their portability and lightweight texture, like this one, so you can use it as a touch up for your sunscreen through the day, or to touch up your makeup in the afternoons after it‚Äôs faded off a little. The lightweight texture feels comfortable, and the light-medium coverage means you can boost your base makeup, if you have to, for the evenings. As I‚Äôve noted, many Korean brand cushion foundations use zinc oxide and titanium dioxide in their ingredients which are physical UV blockers. These are my preferred choice of UV protection and I‚Äôm happy to see them in this one as well. However, due to the coverage of this particular cushion, I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôd be touching up very much. The Packaging &amp; Refills Unlike the other affordable brand I featured a few days ago, the Mamonde Cover Powder Cushion comes in a box with a sealed refill and sponge. This is normal for a mid-high end Korean brand cushion, but a nice surprise in something this affordable. The compact is a little thick with a nice heft, and feels just like a high-end cushion. The cover has the name in a peach-shaped insert on the cover. This is a nod to the peach blossom flowers they say are used in this product. The case is like a donut with a cover, so you clip the refill into place and it fits nicely without any rattling. The covers clips and stays shut, and it just feels well constructed and not cheap at all. Incidentally, I could fit the refills from Hera, Sulwhasoo and Iope in the same case as well! Boo to you Laneige and Innisfree ! The Cushion The cushion for the Mamonde Cover Powder Cushion is fairly traditional, being the flat porous sponge that we have seen from the start. I find that the cushion is a little soft, so you will find yourself depressing your sponge puff further into the product than you expect. Due to the texture of the product, this also means you pick up a lot more product than you really need. When new, touching the sponge to the surface of the cushion is quite enough. As you go along, you will have to adjust your pressure accordingly. The Sponge Puff Again, this was a category I kept in from the previous Cushion Foundation Week series, and I‚Äôm not sure why, because the Koreans know their sponge puff applicators! This Mamonde one is no exception. I will tell you right here right now, that for best effect, ALWAYS USE THE SPONGE PUFF! Incidentally, the Mamonde sponge puff looks almost exactly like the Laneige puffs, right down to the blue base. It‚Äôs almost as if they took the Laneige puffs, changed the band and plonked them into the case! Since they‚Äôre all under the same mother company, I can see it happening. Why change a formula that works?! So, like the Laneige sponge puff, the sponge is soft but dense, with a nice surface density that doesn‚Äôt allow product to absorb product too much. TO USE: Slip your fingers through the loop (it only accommodates 3 fingers for me so I find it a little small), dab the sponge on the surface of the cushion (you can see this is just 1 dab) and then dab it on your skin, in a press and roll motion. Press on skin, and roll it off. It helps the foundation adhere better to your skin. As the texture of the Cover Powder Cushion is quite high coverage, I do find that used in conjunction with the puff, I only need 1-2 pats of product to cover my whole face. Not a lot of dabbing on the cushion required, and like Hera, I find that the less I need, the more even the application process is. Texture, Coverage &amp; Finish Now, if you have a complaint about how sheer or how shiny cushion foundations look on your skin, and you feel that the Hera UV Mist Cushion is out of your budget, then this Mamonde Cover Powder Cushion will likely fit your bill. While the texture of the Mamonde Cover Powder Cushion feels light on skin, the coverage is quite something! Never having heard of this brand or product before this, I had no expectations, so imagine my surprise when I noticed how easy it was to achieve a medium-full coverage look on skin with just a few dabs of this cushion foundation! The name should give it away, really. Cover in Korean brands tend to mean higher coverage. I think the Powder in there means that it has a powdery finish, which it does, drying down to a semi-matte finish that is very longlasting on my skin. Mamonde says that there are ingredients in there that act as a concealer, and I‚Äôd say it is quite accurate. When I use this cushion foundation, I don‚Äôt even use a concealer! I just dab on product where I need more concealing, and it does an amazing job. In these before-after pictures, I‚Äôm wearing the Mamonde Cover Powder Cushion in Shade #21 ‚Äì Peach Beige . Uh, see the coverage?! It‚Äôs crazy coming from a cushion foundation! The shade #21 Peach Beige does, as the name imply, have a peach undertone and it is best suited for those with a light to light-medium skintone. It covers up redness, evens out skintone and draws a veil over my skin. Do I look like I have a personal reflector board with me?! LOL! Not really, but it sure makes my skin look pretty amazing, doesn‚Äôt it?! But‚Ä¶ oh yes, there‚Äôs a BUT! I find that this Mamonde Cover Powder Cushion can tend to look a little cakey. To counteract this cakiness, I sometimes spritz a fine mist of spray over my skin, but it‚Äôs a temporary fix. If you layer on too much product, it does look like you are wearing foundation. It isn‚Äôt as natural as Hera or Sulwhasoo, but I can see how it will appeal to those who want more coverage in a convenient cushion foundation compact. You don‚Äôt even need to use this trick that I teach you here (you can if you wan‚Äôt to, but you won‚Äôt need to), and applying powder over can enhance the cakiness of the product on your skin. What I like to do therefore, is to keep a lighter layer of product on skin, just a thin layer, patted all over, then use cream concealer where I need it and a light powder. This reduces the cakey and fake effect on skin. If you go high coverage, then be aware that it will look rather fake. For this reason, I feel that while this Mamonde cushion comes close to Hera in terms of coverage, the quality just isn‚Äôt there. I don‚Äôt get the transparency I get with Hera and Sulwhasoo (which I‚Äôll elaborate upon later) which means I don‚Äôt get as natural a look. I look like I have makeup on, and that sometimes suits the occasion, but not always. Shade selection Shade selection is fairly poor at this point in time, since they are primarily based in Korea for now, with only a new foray out into the global market now. There are 3 shades available #17, 21 and 23 for very light, light and light medium skintones. Anything deeper, I‚Äôm afraid you‚Äôd have to go to Laneige for your cushions. Scent Yes, there is a floral scent that is quite strong. It doesn‚Äôt linger on skin, but opening the compact wafts a strong sweet scent right in your face. If you‚Äôre sensitive to fragrance in skin products then be wary. Do I like this? I‚Äôm on the fence. I like the price point, and the packaging and the fact that the coverage is nothing short of amazing. But I feel that it isn‚Äôt as refined a product as I‚Äôd like it to be, being a medium-full coverage foundation in a cushion form. It doesn‚Äôt offer me that transparency of skin that I associate with a cushion foundation, and the potential to look cakey on skin doesn‚Äôt endear itself to me. I can counteract that by using only a thin layer, in which case it then works well. It‚Äôs nice, but I won‚Äôt trade it for it‚Äôs higher end cousins üôÇ IN A NUTSHELL The Mamonde Cover Powder Cushion SPF50+ PA+++ is good if you want a higher coverage cushion foundation in an affordable, well made compact. The shade selection is very small, tending to the lighter end of the skintone spectrum, but the coverage is nothing short of amazing. I do find it to look cakey if you pile it on, but if you wear a thin layer, it‚Äôs not a bad product. The packaging is very nice for its price point. If you‚Äôre on a budget but want a nice, medium coverage cushion foundation, this would be the one to go for. PROS: Lightweight texture but can feel heavy if you pile it on skin, Evens out skintone very naturally, Mid to high coverage depending on how much you use, Easy to use, Has a semi-matte finish on skin, Not drying nor oily, High sunscreen protection, Portable packaging, Comes with a refill which makes it even better value for money CONS: Scented, Some people may not like the sponge for application or hygiene purposes, I don‚Äôt mind, Sponge feels a little small, Can look heavy and cakey on skin if you layer too much WHO WILL LIKE THIS: Anyone who wants a higher coverage cushion foundation, Anyone who wants a well packaged cushion with good coverage at an affordable price PRICE: RM129 for a box containing 1 case &amp; 2 refills (That‚Äôs very affordable!). Prices will vary depending on where you buy from as it is available on many different websites as well WHERE TO BUY: Mamonde counters at 1 Utama and MidValley Megamall, various other websites or Korean sites if you know where to look If you‚Äôre interested in what‚Äôs in there, here‚Äôs the ingredient list Water, Titanium Dioxide (Ci 77891), Cyclopentasiloxane, Zinc Oxide (Ci 77947), Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Cyclohexasiloxane, Peg-10 Dimethicone, Phenyl Trimethicone, Butylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Lauryl Peg-9 Polydimethylsiloxyethyl Dimethicone, Arbutin, Hdi/Trimethylol Hexyllactone Crosspolymer, Trimethylsiloxysilicate, Glycerin, Dimethicone, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Disodium Edta, Disteardimonium Hectorite, Lecithin, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Prunus Persica (Peach) Flower Extract, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Hyaluronate, Stearic Acid, Silica, Adenosine, Acrylates/Ethylhexyl Acrylate/Dimethicone Methacrylate Copolymer, Aluminum Hydroxide, Ethylhexylglycerin, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Alcohol, Isostearic Acid, Isopropyl Palmitate, Caprylyl Glycol, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Phenoxyethanol, Polyglyceryl-3 Polyricinoleate, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Iron Oxides (Ci 77492), Iron Oxides (Ci 77491), Iron Oxides (Ci 77499), Fragrance Have you tried this Mamonde Cover Powder Cushion? What else from Mamonde should I be looking to try? I was quite impressed at the fact that the products in Mamonde, which span makeup to skincare are very affordably priced, with their highest priced item being just RM169 at time of writing. That‚Äôs very impressive indeed, and they have a nice department store presence, which makes the brand appear more expensive than it really is! Now, tell me what else I should be trying from Mamonde? üòÄ Paris B More cushion foundations can be found in this category .</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Author</name><value><array><data><value><string>Paris B</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>2016-09-16 08:30:12</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>c7de-44fb-8840</string></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>c5ba9b37707144dcb8e931b07ad80fa55c0fe0ec</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Author</name><value><array><data><value><string>Paris B</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>http://www.mywomenstuff.com/2015/10/how-to-protect-yourself-from-haze/</string></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>Hazy Days are here to stay!

For the uninitiated, you can view the brands featured in the first round-up of this nature and the others featured in this series, here . Naturally, I will not have ALL the brands in the market ‚Äì Korean brands aren‚Äôt all that generous at providing samples, unlike the Western brands I worked with before this ‚Äì but I have enough to take you through 7 (yes, count that) SEVEN days of Cushion Foundations. This time, we will have a whole WEEK of cushions and then on Day 8 (if I have not yet collapsed from exhaustion), I‚Äôll give you a round up, and on Day 9 (Yes, I‚Äôve thought this through) I‚Äôll do you a quick comparison of Korean vs Western brand cushions based on what I‚Äôve tested so far. Whew! There‚Äôs a lot to get through so, fasten your seatbelts, here we go! Are you feeling a sense of deja-vu? Where have you seen this before?! üòõ Yes, Day 4 of Cushion Foundation Week 2 revisits the same brand as that I featured on Day 1, popular cushion brand, Laneige. This is the 2016 version of the Laneige BB Cushion Whitening SPF50+ PA+++ cushion. Why did I separate the two? Well, it‚Äôs because I realised that they were different! Please read this through, even if the sense of deja vu is strong üòõ Cushion Foundation: Laneige BB Cushion Whitening SPF50+ PA+++ In 2016 Laneige unveiled their newest version of their popular BB Cushion. This one I‚Äôm showing you today is the Whitening version, which as the name implies, offers a more brightening formula. Apparently, Laneige has infused the BB Cushion Whitening with Sparkling Coat‚Ñ¢ technology that infuses the product with pearlescent particles, and also Melacrusher, to help break down melanin and actually help with lightening dark spots. Skincare in a makeup, wouldn‚Äôt you know? What this means in simple English, is that if you want something dewy and glowy, this is the one you will be going for, because this is what it offers ‚Äì a glowy finish on skin, as compared to the Pore Control version that offers a semi-matte finish. If you have both, how can you tell which is which? Well, you can tell from the case. The holographic center is the same, but you see the ring around it? The Whitening version is a pearly white-blue, while the Pore Control version is a bright, light blue. Sunscreen protection : SPF50+ PA+++ I‚Äôm not sure why I kept this section in, because all Korean Cushion foundations come with high SPF rating. That said, if you‚Äôre using a cushion foundation in place of sunscreen , come, let me smack you üòõ However, what is good about cushion foundations, is their portability and lightweight texture, like this one, so you can use it as a touch up for your sunscreen through the day, or to touch up your makeup in the afternoons after it‚Äôs faded off a little. The lightweight texture feels comfortable, and the light-medium coverage means you can boost your base makeup, if you have to, for the evenings. Like the other Korean BB Cushions I‚Äôve featured so far, this one too uses zinc oxide and titanium dioxide as UV blockers. The Packaging &amp; Refills Mine was a press gift, and so came without a refill. However, when you purchase the actual product, the Laneige BB Cushion Whitening will come with a sealed refill and sponge. The cover of the cushion, which is what helps keep it from drying out, is attached to the capsule so every refill comes with its own cover and own sponge for hygiene reasons. The cushion also comes sealed. Refills are likely sold separately as well (in Korea, not in Malaysia), which lowers the cost, once you‚Äôre done with the 2 that your original set came in. One thing I must note is the construction of the whole compact, which I find sturdy with a nice heft. It does not feel plasticky nor cheap, and the refill clips nicely into the case. I like the rounded edges, and the metallic accents, that I feel makes the compact look more luxurious. I will note however, that this Laneige BB Cushion refill does not fit into the cases of any other Korean (or Amore Pacific) brand in the market. I tested it with the ones I own. I‚Äôm not sure if the older ones did. The Cushion The design is similar to that of the Pore Control version, with the raised, textured sponge that feels rather firmer to the touch than normal. I must say however, that the sponge does seem to pick up product more evenly. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs to do with this 3D design, but whatever they‚Äôre doing, it works. When it‚Äôs new, I do find that you only have to touch the sponge to the surface of the cushion to pick up the product. As you use it, and as you open and close the case, it will slowly start to dry out, and you will find yourself having to depress it harder. I don‚Äôt find it to spill over onto my sponge, so it isn‚Äôt oversaturated. I haven‚Äôt owned this long enough to tell you if it‚Äôll dry out very quickly, but from experience, expect it to with regular use. The Sponge Puff Again, this was a category I kept in from the previous Cushion Foundation Week series, and I‚Äôm not sure why, because the Koreans know their sponge puff applicators! This Laneige one is no exception. I will tell you right here right now, that for best effect, ALWAYS USE THE SPONGE PUFF! The Laneige BB Cushion puff has a blue base, and is springy but not too soft. These is a certain bounce to it, that I find important, because it is that bounce that helps apply the product to your skin more smoothly and evenly. You can see how a more used sponge puff looks as opposed to one that‚Äôs new . I do find that as time goes on, you do have to depress harder to pick up product, due to the firmness of the cushion. TO USE: Slip your fingers through the loop (it only accommodates 3 fingers for me so I find it a little small), dab the sponge on the surface of the cushion (you can see this is just 1 dab) and then dab it on your skin, in a press and roll motion. Press on skin, and roll it off. It helps the foundation adhere better to your skin. I find that the density of the cushion is such that it doesn‚Äôt absorb the product too quickly, so I can cover about 1/3 to 1/2 of my face with just 1 dab of cushion foundation. I then go over the areas where I want better coverage. Texture, Coverage &amp; Finish If you‚Äôve been feeling a sense of deja vu reading this post, I don‚Äôt blame you. The packaging and construction of this BB Cushion is pretty much the same as the Pore Control version. But it is in the texture and finish of the product that the differences come in . While the texture of this Laneige BB Cushion Whitening is lightweight, and feels almost like nothing on the skin, I find that this one feels tackier. So, when it goes on my skin, it doesn‚Äôt seem to set, unlike the BB Cushion Pore Control version. It is rather reminiscent of the Innisfree Water Glow Cushion , in that it remains feeling tacky on skin until I set it with a powder. Also, Laneige weren‚Äôt kidding about that Sparkling Coat technology. What it does, is give my skin a glow, which I translate into as shine. I‚Äôm not a big fan of a fully ‚Äúglowy‚Äù look, nor of the fully ‚Äúmatte‚Äù looks. I like my skin to just look like skin. This one, in our humidity and heat, makes me look like I‚Äôve been gently perspiring as I sit quietly without fidgeting. Perhaps, if the weather was drier, a look like this would make your skin look healthier. But not in the tropics. It just makes me look a mess üôÅ You can‚Äôt see it too well in this before-after picture where I‚Äôm wearing the Laneige BB Cushion Whitening in Shade #21 Beige but you can see the coverage, which in my view, is lower than that of the Pore Control version. For some reason, I don‚Äôt find the Laneige BB Cushion Whitening to be very impressive when worn. I find the coverage very light, but it doesn‚Äôt seem to even out my skintone very much. This just seems like a more inferior cushion, compared to the Pore Control version, and I couldn‚Äôt quite understand why. In fact, I find every reason not to use this, while I‚Äôm quite happy using the Pore Control version. I tried using this trick for better coverage, but it didn‚Äôt look very good. I think, the base itself isn‚Äôt very good to start with, so for now, this one is, for me, just a wee bit better than the Innisfree Water Glow Cushion, because it is less tacky. Otherwise, I honestly wouldn‚Äôt bother with it, and would go for the BB Cushion Pore Control instead. Shade selection The shade selection is impressive, in 8 shades ‚Äì 13, 21, 23, 31, 33, 35 and 2 cool toned (pink based) shades 13C and 21C. I wear this in #21, which I find is the shade I wear in all Korean base shades. I have not tried 13, but in view of how light #21 is on my skin, I think #13 would be too light for me. I like how Laneige has shades 31, 33 and 35 now, which are deeper shades, to cater for a wider selection of the market. So, if you want to try a Korean cushion foundation, and have always lamented the lack of deeper shades, then you may want to stop by a Laneige counter to take a look. I haven‚Äôt seen them myself, so I cannot say how deep or useful they are, but it‚Äôs worth a look. Scent Yes, there is a slight floral scent so if you‚Äôre sensitive to fragrance in skin products then be wary. It‚Äôs not overpowering nor uncomfortable, so I don‚Äôt mind it very much. Do I like this? Actually, no I don‚Äôt. If I had tried this one first, instead of the BB Cushion Pore Control, I would have sworn off Cushion Foundations forever. I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt. This feels tacky on the skin, and gives it a shine that I dislike, and has very low coverage. I don‚Äôt like it. IN A NUTSHELL The Laneige BB Cushion Whitening SPF50+ PA+++ is a new version for 2016. The packaging has been improved, so it looks more sleek, and the cushion now sports a textured, patterned surface. I find that this one feels heavier on my skin and stays tacky for a long time. I also find that the coverage is very low, and it gives a glowy shine to the skin that I find unflattering in the heat and humidity. I do have normal-dry skin, and I think that anyone with oily skin might not like it much either due to the shine. I‚Äôm not enjoying this one at all! PROS: Lightweight texture, Easy to use, Has a glowy finish on skin if you like that, Not drying nor oily, High sunscreen protection, Portable packaging, Comes with a refill which makes it value for money, Wider shade selection for deeper skintones CONS: Scented, Some people may not like the sponge for application or hygiene purposes, I don‚Äôt mind, Sponge feels a little small, Low coverage, Stays tacky on skin, Gives a glowy shine that I find unflattering in heat and humidity WHO WILL LIKE THIS: Anyone who likes a glowy finish to their base makeup, Anyone who likes low coverage bases PRICE: RM159 for a box containing 1 case &amp; 2 refills. Prices will vary depending on where you buy from as it is available on many different websites WHERE TO BUY: Laneige counters in most major department stores and many K-beauty websites (none of which I‚Äôve shopped at before and so have no suggestions) If you‚Äôre interested in what‚Äôs in there, here‚Äôs the ingredient list Purified Water, Cyclopentasiloxane, Zinc Oxide, Titanium Dioxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, PEG-10 Dimethicone, Cyclohexasiloxane, Phenyl Trimethicone, Butylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Niacinamide, Lauryl PEG-9 Polydimethylsiloxyethyl Dimethicone, Acrylates/Ethylhexyl Acrylate/Dimethicone Methacrylate Copolymer, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, 1,2-Hexanediol, Camellia sinensis Leaf Extract, Dimethicone, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Disodium EDTA, Disteardimonium Hectorite, Magnesium Sulfate, Mica, Manganese Sulfate, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Chloride, Stearic Acid, Silica, Ascorbyl Glucoside, Acrylates/Stearyl Acrylate/Dimethicone Methacrylate Copolymer, Aluminum Hydroxide, HDI/Trimethylol Hexyllactone Crosspolymer, Zinc Sulfate, Caprylyl Glycol, Calcium Chloride, Chenopodium quinoa Seed Extract, Trimethylsiloxysilicate, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Phenoxyethanol, Polysorbate 80, Polypropylsilsesquioxane, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Yeast Extract, Yellow Oxide of Iron, Red Oxide of Iron, Black Oxide of Iron, Aromatics Have you tried either of the new Laneige BB Cushions? Which did you pick or prefer? I didn‚Äôt quite expect 2 cushion foundations from the same brand to perform so differently, but as you can see, they do. If I‚Äôd used this one first, I‚Äôd not have even bothered to try the Pore Control version. But I‚Äôm glad I tested them the other way around. This one, I cannot be bothered with, to be honest! Did you try this?

I love my luxury products but for a blush, CorALL I Need!</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>http://www.mywomenstuff.com/2016/09/catrice-blush-artist-palette-corall-i-need/</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>Apologies for the enforced break. We had some technical problems in the past few days that had the website looking a little screwy, so I couldn‚Äôt work on it. Little things you know. But I was kind of glad because it allowed me a few days to breathe and just get back into the swing of things! Not long ago, I showed you a pretty blush from affordable brand, Catrice . It was pretty to wear and pretty to look at. But it had its shortcomings. Well, let me now show you yet another blush from Catrice, that is not only pretty to wear and pretty to look at, it has no real shortcomings that I know of! Now, for a picky blush user like me, that‚Äôs quite a feat! This rather battered looking palette is the Catrice Blush Artist palette in 020 Corall I Need that is basically a blush trio. There are 3 shades I believe, a bronzey trio and a rosy pink trio besides this coral trio. I don‚Äôt know very much about availability, but all I will say is this ‚Äì if you see this at your local Catrice counter, buy it. Do not pass go! You will regret not getting it I promise! üòÄ You might be even more swayed when I tell you that my other favourite blush palette has been the Hourglass Ambient Lighting Blush palette, which is limited edition and therefore a waste of time for me to tell you about it. You also know that I love my luxury brands, but so often these days, I simply reach into my blush drawer and pick this palette up, because it‚Äôs just perfect for what I need on a day to day basis! üòÄ In fact, this affordable beauty has become my de rigueur travel palette, because not only is it handy with 3 shades of blush, it actually looks very pretty when worn, and it is so slim and portable! The clear plastic packaging, while a little brittle, is fairly sturdy so it holds up to gentle wear. What doesn‚Äôt hold up however, is the print of the name and brand on the cover, as you can see in the first picture. The shade I picked was 020 Corall I Need, which is a palette of shades that are more pink than coral, to my eye. The shade on left in particular, is a lovely shade of warm pink with shimmer, the middle shade, a more satin textured pink blush with a coral undertone, and the shade on right, a more shimmery highlighter shade of light peach. What I found most impressive was how pigmented the shades were. It was very easy to pick up colour with any sort of brush ‚Äì loose, dense, synthetic or natural hair. I‚Äôve tried it with different brushes, and they all pick up product well. Too well, sometimes, because if you aren‚Äôt careful, you can end up with more colour than you intend. Here are the swatches, and you can see how intense the colours can be. But if you use a brush, naturally the colours will be more diffused, and much more flattering! I like to take a fluffy brush, lightly run it across all 3 shades in the palette, and then apply to my cheeks by dabbing the colour on. Incidentally, dabbing on blush is a new technique I‚Äôve been using lately and I prefer how it looks! I‚Äôll share it with you another day üôÇ When worn, it looks something like this. Crap. I haven‚Äôt done these gigantic FOTD thingies in a while. Scared me a little üòõ The blush however, I find is very flattering, and the quality of the pigment and shimmer is just right, so it doesn‚Äôt look cheap nor garish when worn. You can choose to pile on the highlight shade, and it still will look flattering, because it doesn‚Äôt go on with chunks of glitter. You can see how the Corall I Need palette basically pulls pink on my skin. I‚Äôve been tempted to buy the rose shade palette, but am afraid it might go on too strongly for me. I think it would look amazing on deeper skintones though! üôÇ And how affordable is affordable? I can hear you thinking back there. Well, here in Malaysia it retails at RM23.90 a palette and often goes on sale. So I got mine for under RM20. UNDER RM20! That‚Äôs just about US$5 at today‚Äôs exchange rate. Now, tell me that‚Äôs not a bargain?! So, go ‚Äì run out and get it before it disappears! üòÄ IN A NUTSHELL This Catrice Blush Artist Palette is such a cheap and cheerful find, there‚Äôs absolutely NO REASON not to get it. The quality is great, there isn‚Äôt that awful cheap scent you find in some cheap makeup brands, the blush is pigmented, the shimmer isn‚Äôt too over the top, and it blends well. Importantly, it‚Äôs flattering and it doesn‚Äôt give off a US$5 makeup vibe. Get thee one. Or maybe even 2! üòÄ PROS: Affordable, Pigmented, Fine shimmer highlight, No cheap perfume scent, Portable, Easy to blend, Flattering colours CONS: None unless you count that the name on the plastic palette will rub off eventually WHO WILL LIKE THIS: Anyone who loves blush, Anyone who wants a cheap and cheerful makeup find PRICE: RRP RM23.90 | ‚Ç¨4.49 but often goes on sale WHERE TO BUY: Catrice displays at Guardian pharmacy (Malaysia and Singapore) while stocks last, Anywhere that Catrice is sold I believe this item was released in Europe in early 2016 but it‚Äôs only just found its way to our shores in the second half of the year. I don‚Äôt know if they‚Äôre permanent or if they‚Äôre limited edition (there is NO NEWS from Catrice here and I honestly will not be surprised if they pull out some day, simply due to lack of marketing of what is such an underrated brand!) but I don‚Äôt see a lot of stock at the poorly stocked Catrice display stands at the pharmacy, although it does come and go, so good luck! üòõ Have you tried this blush palette? I‚Äôve been raving about it on Instagram for a while now, so this is basically just to put down in longer, more comprehensive sentences how I feel about this blush palette. Basically, just go and get it. I love mine to bits, and it is the first item I pop into my makeup pouch because I just know it‚Äôll go with every look üòÄ Do you think I should get the other two shades?! LOL! üòÄ Paris B</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Author</name><value><array><data><value><string>Paris

Mask with the oversized cult status</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>http://www.mywomenstuff.com/2015/07/bio-essence-hydra-triaction-aqua-droplet-sleeping-beauty-mask/</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>Here‚Äôs a funny thing. Bio-Essence is a brand from Singapore available locally in most pharmacies and has been available for years and years. I‚Äôd actually watched the brand launch from Day 1 (almost) and truth be told, knowing their origins, I was never very sold on their products or claims so I‚Äôve never tried their products. Yet, when I saw that this very same product was being sold at almost TRIPLE its price online in the UK, and been given cult status by ‚Äúgurus‚Äù no less, I had to see what the fuss was about! Tsk. The power of suggestion eh? This, which to give it its full title, is the very wordy Bio-essence Hydra Tri-Action Aqua Droplet Sleeping Beauty Mask * takes deep breath * and the cult status product in question. This is sold at ¬£29 online here which at today‚Äôs exchange rate is about RM172. It retails at local pharmacies at RM70 (¬£11) or so and it could even be much less when it goes on sale, which is often. I purchased this at about RM55 (¬£9) or thereabouts! I basically stood in the aisle at Watson‚Äôs pharmacy giggling dementedly to myself when I saw the price. I think the sales person left me alone because I looked off my rocker LOL! üòÄ This must be what people must feel like when they go to Europe/France and see how cheap French pharmacy skincare is, and how much more expensive they are in other parts of the world or online. But the big question isn‚Äôt about the price, it‚Äôs about whether I feel this deserves its raves as a cult product. My answer is no, it doesn‚Äôt. But it is a pretty interesting product that does a RM55/¬£9 job. I wouldn‚Äôt pay the online asking price so if you have friends in South East Asia, ask them to pick you up a tub. What makes it interesting? The Aqua Droplets thing. Let me show you how it works. On left, I‚Äôve shown you a dollop of the product scooped out of the tub. It‚Äôs an opaque white and it feels very very silicone-y. A word of warning. You mustn‚Äôt be squeamish about silicone in your skincare products if you want to try this because it almost feels like you‚Äôre slathering silicone on your skin. But rub at it and spread it out, and it almost magically creates water droplets on your skin, as you see in the picture on the right. This bit is rather fun. Most of the thick silicone-waxy feel is significantly reduced, but it is still there. It does not absorb fully into my skin, although the water droplets will. This Bio-essence Tri-Action Sleeping Beauty Mask is first and foremost, marketed as a sleeping mask. So, like all sleeping masks, what you do is, at the end of the day, after cleansing and toning, apply a fairly thick layer of product to your skin, rub it so it turns into water droplets, pat it into your skin and go to sleep. It‚Äôs supposed to hydrate and rebalance your skin. Personally speaking, I find that it gives a bit of an instant boost of hydration to the skin when the water droplets are absorbed, but it doesn‚Äôt last. I also won‚Äôt use this in the day although they say you can, by using a thin layer of product instead. The reason I say so is because the thick silicone feel puts me off, and it never really absorbs, sitting on the top of my skin like a layer of grime. The other reason I‚Äôm not enamoured with this, is the scent. Not many people mention this, and perhaps some people might even like the scent, but I find it too strong and too floral. It‚Äôs not unpleasant, but it‚Äôs there and I don‚Äôt like it. If I were going to use a sleeping mask, I‚Äôd still pick the Laneige Sleeping Mask for hydration and the Sulwhasoo Overnight Revitalizing Mask for an instant overnight pick-me-up. I‚Äôd even pick the sleeping mask from The Body Shop despite it‚Äôs strange texture over this, for efficacy; but I now have this, I‚Äôll use it. But it‚Äôs not a repurchase, that‚Äôs for sure. At Phil‚Äôs suggestion, I sometimes apply a thinnish layer of this mask, get the water droplet action going, then slap a sheet mask on top. It feels much better that way. On its own, I don‚Äôt think it deserves the hype nor its cult status. Perhaps it‚Äôs the price (relatively speaking) that has people excited about this? Or perhaps the raves by beauty gurus. All I‚Äôd say is, it‚Äôs an ok product. Not one I‚Äôd be shouting from the rooftops about, and definitely not one I‚Äôm paying more than its real price for üôÇ IN A NUTSHELL The Bio-essence Hydra Tri-Action Aqua Droplet Sleeping Beauty Mask is a highly raved product that has been given cult status, but one which I feel falls far short of being a cult product. It is a sleeping mask with a bit of difference, in that when you rub at it, water droplets will appear and sink into the skin. However, it is packed chock-full of silicones that leaves a layer on the skin no matter how much or little you apply. I‚Äôd use this only for they say this is ‚Äì a sleeping mask that you‚Äôd use 1-2 times a week. Don‚Äôt use it daily because I think there are far better products you can use as a daily hydration serum or cream. PROS: Affordable, Interesting to activate the water droplets that absorb into the skin for an instant hydration boost CONS: High content of silicone that leaves a layer of residue on the skin, Highly priced at online stores, Effects are not long lasting, Strongly scented WHO WILL LIKE THIS: Anyone who doesn‚Äôt mind silicone in their products, Anyone who wants to try a fairly inexpensive sleeping mask Here is the ingredient list of the product for those interested. Have you tried this Bio-Essence sleeping mask? Do you think it‚Äôs worth the cult status it‚Äôs been given? Personally, I feel this product has been hyped beyond its true efficacy. I personally find it just average in performance. As I‚Äôve said above, if you want to try it, buy it during one of the sales at the local pharmacies. If you‚Äôre living overseas and really REALLY want to try this, see if you have friends in Malaysia/Singapore or maybe even Hong Kong or China (I‚Äôm not sure of the prices in those 2 places) who can help you. But I suppose if all else fails, there‚Äôs always Cult Beauty even if it is very much overpriced there! üòÄ Paris B Bio-essence Hydra Tri-action Aqua Droplet Sleeping Beauty Mask Price: RM70+ | ¬£29 | S$33.90 for 80g Availability: Major pharmacies in Malaysia and Singapore or online at Cult Beauty</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Author</name><value><array><data><value><string>Paris B</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>2015-07-24 08:30:26</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>c7de-44fb-8840</string></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>9501b22f6410279a2daaeffa539539013f661abc</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Author</name><value><array><data><value><string>Paris B</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>http://www.mywomenstuff.com/2007/04/beauty-in-your-kitchen-extra-virgin-olive-oil/</string></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>Beauty in your kitchen: Extra Virgin Olive Oil</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>2007-04-13 09:46:42</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>c7de-44fb-8840</string></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>e154da75bd79197f1b45d955a276283a1617fc54</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>Putting affordable sunscreen to the test!

I preach it from the rooftops, it would seem, and it gratifies me that almost everyone I‚Äôve suggested it to likes it as much as I do. The only complaint we all have is one big one ‚Äì price. Yes, the Shiseido Perfect UV sunscreen might be perfect, but it comes at a high price that some of us might find galling to spend on a product you will use lavishly, and often and that you just must replenish! I mean, what else would you use right? So I decided I‚Äôd try some affordable sunscreen and tell you what you think. This was one of my experiments. I couldn‚Äôt possibly try every brand in the market, so I reached out to some PR people to ask if they had anything they were willing to put under my pretty microscopic scrutiny having a minimum of SPF50 and PA++++ rating. Happily, some were quite willing to hang it out there and the Skin Aqua Sarafit UV was one of them. There are 2 versions of the Skin Aqua Sarafit UV sunscreens ‚Äì one is a UV essence (cream) and the other is a mist. Let me first deal with the mist, so I can get it over and done with. Ah yep, I am not a fan of the mist version and I will tell you why! Skin Aqua Sarafit UV Mist SPF50+ PA++++ ‚Äì RM42.30 / 50g Let me first tell you that I don‚Äôt get mist sunscreens. Yes, I totally get the idea of convenience. No one likes to top up their sunscreen during the day when they‚Äôre outside, and it‚Äôs so convenient to just spray it on isn‚Äôt it? In theory anyway. In practice, we need a lot of sunscreen to actually protect our skin ( 1 teaspoon is the rule of thumb). So if you spray on your sunscreen, how can you be sure that you are spraying on enough to properly protect your skin? You need to ensure a smooth even coverage (aerosol spray cans are notoriously hard to control for an even finish ‚Äì if you‚Äôve ever tried to spray paint anything, you‚Äôd understand) and sufficient product to actually protect your skin. Now, how many of us bother? We think just spraying it on does the job. No it does not. Secondly, how much of the product actually goes on the skin and how much is blown away? If you‚Äôre outside or by the beach or pool (where I see these mist sunscreens most commonly pushed as being suitable for) it tends to be breezy. So, if you spray this, and a breeze comes along, most of the product is blown away by the wind. You THINK you get product on your skin ‚Äì but in reality, you don‚Äôt get enough on. And then you wonder why you burn. Thirdly, some like this one, suggest that to get around points 1 and 2 above, you spray the product into the palm of your hand and then apply to your skin. Well, let me just say that if you‚Äôre going to do that, why don‚Äôt you use a regular cream sunscreen instead? You don‚Äôt like the texture of the Sarafit UV Essence? Well, get another brand you might prefer! There‚Äôs no excuse, really. So I say ditch the mist sunscreens, and I personally think they‚Äôre bollocks and just encouraging us to be lazy. Just slap on some proper creamy sunscreen and you‚Äôll be done with it. Needless to say therefore, I‚Äôm not a fan of the Sarafit UV Mist and I would just bin this. There‚Äôs no shortcut to skin protection from UV rays. If you want protection, do it properly and don‚Äôt be lazy. Sunscreen and sun protection is not a fashionable thing, it‚Äôs a health thing. You don‚Äôt put on sunscreen just because everyone says you should. You either believe in it and do it properly or you don‚Äôt, but you want people to believe you do and fall for gimmicks. So, I didn‚Äôt talk a lot about this product because I have no faith in it at all. It goes on my skin feeling weird as all mist sunscreens do, with an oily feeling that I absolutely abhor. I will never tell anyone to get this but if you feel comfortable enough then here‚Äôs the ingredient list for the Sarafit UV Mist sunscreen. Skin Aqua Sarafit UV Essence ‚Äì RM40 for 50g Now that I‚Äôm done ranting‚Ä¶ *takes deep breath* here‚Äôs the other version of the sunscreen which is the UV Essence. Despite the name ‚ÄúEssence‚Äù which brings to mind a light gel-type texture, this is a cream, and one that I feel may feel a bit heavy if you have oily skin. I have drier skin and I do feel that the texture is moisturising enough, but it is a bit heavy. I attribute the heaviness to silicones. But this one is a pretty decent product for the price. I mean it‚Äôs fairly cheap and it even goes on sale often so if you are the sort who runs through your sunscreen like water, and don‚Äôt want to pay too much then this might be something you might like. The texture is a little creamy however, as you see above. It is easy to blend into the skin and I have observed a slight heavy feeling which dissipates once the product absorbs and dries on the skin. It isn‚Äôt oily or greasy and doesn‚Äôt turn me oily or greasy as the day wears on (I do have normal-dry skin however) but there is bit of a ‚Äúdry-touch‚Äù texture to the skin that feels a little strange. It‚Äôs like you‚Äôre wearing a primer. But despite that primer-feeling, it doesn‚Äôt make a good base for my makeup. So after experimenting for weeks, I now keep this as my weekend sunscreen. It does the job. When I‚Äôm out, it seems to protect my skin fairly well (I don‚Äôt feel like my face is burning) and because it comes in a portable, slim tube, it‚Äôs easy to tote around and reapply if that suits you. I‚Äôm very generous about this because it‚Äôs cheap and does a fairly decent job at its primary function ‚Äì protecting skin from UV rays. There is a slight floral scent that I don‚Äôt really notice, so I‚Äôm sure most people won‚Äôt either since experience tells me I seem to have a more sensitive nose than most of you üòõ But I like the texture of this one, it feels comfortable on my skin and it seems to work well enough to protect my skin from burning in the sun. If you have oilier skin you may find this a bit heavy so be warned. Here is the ingredient list for the Sarafit UV Essence. IN A NUTSHELL These are both very affordable sunscreen and easily available at major pharmacies. I don‚Äôt personally think the Sarafit UV Mist sunscreen offers sufficient protection, and it has a very weird oily after feel that I dislike on my skin. I would ditch it. As for the Sarafit UV Essence, I like the texture which is hydrating, comfortable and isn‚Äôt oily or greasy. Skin feels like you‚Äôre wearing a primer, but it doesn‚Äôt seem to function very well as one. I‚Äôd use the UV Essence as a weekend sunscreen when you won‚Äôt be wearing a lot of makeup on your face, and want something portable and affordable that you can be liberal with using. If you have oily skin then you might find the creamy texture a bit rich or heavy in which case, you might consider another option in another range or brand. Don‚Äôt bother considering the mist. PROS: Portable packaging, Very affordable, SPF50+ and PA++++ ratings are admirably high in a pharmacy brand product that makes it easy to be liberal about use without worrying about cost CONS: UV Mist isn‚Äôt a practical formula or application method for sunscreen, UV Essence may feel too creamy or heavy for those with very oily skin WHO WILL LIKE THIS: The UV Essence should do well for anyone with normal-dry skin that doesn‚Äôt mind the slightly creamy texture Have you used either product? Do you like using mist sunscreens? I‚Äôm afraid I went right to town there with my little rant LOL! üòÄ But I‚Äôve tried my share of mist/spray sunscreens and I‚Äôve never come across one I like. But the cream version of this Sarafit UV sunscreen is pretty decent for the price. You can be generous with use and not feel it, so I‚Äôd keep this as my ‚Äòleisure‚Äô sunscreen. It still doesn‚Äôt replace my HG so the search continues! üòõ Paris B Skin Aqua Sarafit UV Mist Price: RM42.30/50g and Skin Aqua Sarafit UV Essence Price: RM40/50g Availability: Most major pharmacies</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Author</name><value><array><data><value><string>Paris B</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>2015-08-17 08:30:54</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>c7de-44fb-8840</string></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>9ccb2398eb849724bdb5f7261a10f2eb598d5918</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>May your winged eyeliner be ‚Äúon fleek‚Äù with the Maybelline Hypersharp Wing Liner</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>http://www.mywomenstuff.com/2015/09/maybelline-hypersharp-wing-liner/</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>Gosh, I haven‚Äôt lined my eyes for so long, that I seem to have forgotten how! LOL! No, I‚Äôm serious! I tightline my eyes daily, but I haven‚Äôt lined the top lid in ages for one very simple reason‚Ä¶.. my old liquid liner dried out! LOL Yes, I‚Äôm dead serious. When I line the top lid, I prefer using a liquid liner, because it doesn‚Äôt mess up as quickly and the one I‚Äôd been using was the very affordable and easy to use, Maybelline Hypersharp liner . When I first laid eyes on the new Maybelline Hypersharp Wing liner , I thought ‚ÄúOh hey! I can line my lids again!‚Äù and this time, this new liner promises you a much easier way to get a winged eyeliner look. Winged liner ‚ÄúOn fleek‚Äù as the young ‚Äòuns will say LOL! Looks pretty unassuming, doesn‚Äôt it? Like its earlier Hypersharp sibling, the new Hypersharp Wing liner is a liquid liner in a felt tip pen form. But if you look further down, here‚Äôs what makes this particular one a doddle to use, if you want to create a winged tip, or just a thick liner. What makes the Hypersharp Wing liner a little more unique than most, is the nib of the pen. It has a rather firm nib that has a little bit of flex to it, but it is your ability to use it in 2 ways, that makes it special. Here‚Äôs how the nib looks. From the side, it looks flat. If you use this flat edge, you will get a nice thin line. From the top (top being relative), you see a flat tapered paddle shaped nib. This allows you to draw a fairly broad line, while the tapered tip allows for a bit of a flick, if you are into that. Here, let me show you how it looks when I draw on the back of my hand. The thin lines are drawn using the thin edge, while the thicker lines are drawn using the flat side. Can you do this with the regular Maybelline Hypersharp liner? Why of course you can! It‚Äôs all about angles and how you hold your pen üôÇ But this ‚Äúdual tip‚Äù liner pen does make it easier, make no mistake. Does it give me a good winged liner? Well, it‚Äôs hard to say you know. I don‚Äôt really go for that look. So here‚Äôs how I would use it, pretty much the same way I use all my liquid liners to line my upper eyelid. What I do like about this, is how easy it is to get a thick line. If you have slightly hooded or hidden lids like mine, you might realise that you need to draw a significantly thicker liner to get it to show when your eyes are open. While you can use any regular liner to do the job, the flat, broader side of the Hypersharp Wing liner makes it easier to achieve this with the minimum of fuss. The upshot of this, is that you get the job done more quickly and that‚Äôs always a good thing. It‚Äôs also fairly affordable, which is always a good thing when it comes to products like these that dry out easily. Yes, that‚Äôs one of the drawbacks you will find. Like its cousin the Hypersharp liner, there will be a tendency for this to dry out quickly. The other thing that has me feeling a little more ambivalent is the depth of colour. This isn‚Äôt as black as I‚Äôd like it to be. If you look at the swatches on the back of my hand, you may notice that while it‚Äôs black, it isn‚Äôt a deep, intense black. It‚Äôs more of a watered down black, and I do find that if you ‚Äústretch‚Äù the product in the wing, the colour can fade a little. Ditto if you use it over a cream eyeshadow. It glides on easily, but it isn‚Äôt very black. The third strike against this is how the felt tip ‚Äúskips‚Äù a little. If you look at the line I drew on the close up of my eye, you may notice how the end isn‚Äôt as sharp as it should be. Yes, I can tidy it up and present to you a perfect looking winged eyeliner, but then I‚Äôd not be able to show you that it sometimes doesn‚Äôt look that way immediately, especially if you just go over with one pass. Otherwise, if you get past all that, it‚Äôs affordable, its easy to use, I find that it dries quickly so it doesn‚Äôt interfere with my eye makeup, and it lasts all day (it‚Äôs humid where I live). I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs a decent product. Could be better, but decent nonetheless. IN A NUTSHELL The Maybelline Hypersharp Wing Liner is a liquid liner in a felt tip pen form. The tip is flat with a tapered paddle shape that you can use to create a fairly thick line, or you can twist it on its side and use the thin edge to draw a thin line, or create a winged tip flick. It glides on easily, it dries quickly and it stays put, on top of being affordable. However, I would prefer if it had a more intense black colour, and the tip can skip a little. But if you like creating thick eyeliner, then this is an affordable and easy way to do it. PROS: Affordable, Easy to use and portable, Unique tip makes it easy to draw a thick or thin line very easily depending on how you hold the pen CONS: Not very intense black, Tip can skip a little when drawing the outer flick, Will dry out quite quickly WHO WILL LIKE THIS: Anyone who wants to create a flicked winged eyeliner look, Anyone who wants an easy way to draw thick eyeliner Have you tried this new Hypersharp Wing eyeliner? Did you find it useful? I actually found it useful because it takes the work out of drawing a thicker line, and that means less room for error. You can quite literally get a fairly thick line in just 1 swipe of the pen.

The Oils of Life is a category unto its own with more than just a facial oil, which may explain the rather long product name. There are one or two other products in the Oils of Life range, but my interest laid primarily in the facial oil. I am after all, a big fan of facial oil, and this one was one of the more easily accessible, and I dare say, one of the more affordable ones. I had to see how it fared. Well, to pre-empt you, let me just say that if you have oily or even combination skin, this is not the facial oil for you. But if you have dry skin, or live where the weather will turn very cold and dry, then you (and your wallet) will enjoy this one! üôÇ First off, can I just have a cheer for the beautiful packaging? The Oils of Life Intensely Revitalising Facial Oil comes in a lovely ombre-shaded glass bottle, with a glass dropper. I love the warm, sunset tones used in the design of the bottle. The oil itself is a clear, pale yellow. I‚Äôve had mine for quite a while now, and the bottle on my dresser cheers me up no end! üòÄ The texture of the Oils of Life Intensely Revitalising Facial Oil is indisputably an oil, with an oily feel. If you don‚Äôt like the feeling of oil on your skin, then this will not sit well with you. However, if you are already familiar with using facial oils, and massaging oils into your skin, then this is a texture you will enjoy. I do find that it has an after-feel of a dry oil, in that my fingertips don‚Äôt feel very oily, unlike say a rosehip oil . I find that about 2 drops, massaged into damp skin is sufficient for use as a light serum, under a moisturiser. It leaves my skin feeling soft, comfortable and well moisturised. I use this at night, and sleeping in an air-conditioned room doesn‚Äôt dry out my skin. It feels very comfortable. I hesitate to make claims to more revitalised or firmer skin, as I do use a plethora of other skincare, both day and night, and I do take care of my skin. So, I cannot claim that this one product has helped with fine lines or skin texture. But I will say that it does plump up the skin with regular nightly use, and keeps it protected and well moisturised all night. For that, I am happy with it. I do however, have to make a note about the scent. The scent of the Oils of Life Intensely Revitalising Facial Oil is rather warm, spicy and woodsy. In a cool room or perhaps, in cooler weather, scents like this feel comforting. In warm weather, it can smell a little strong. Granted, they are a combination of plant-based essential oils, but I do feel it to be rather muskier than I‚Äôd like. I can‚Äôt use this oil on its own however. I find the scent too strong, and it doesn‚Äôt seem to work as well, when used as a mask , the way I like to use my oils. But as a light serum (just 1-2 drops!) under a moisturiser in the evening, it is very nice. Mix it into your moisturiser, if you prefer (or are lazy) to reap its benefits. I prefer to layer, but that works too. If the scent sits well with you, I think this is a pretty decent facial oil, and a good introduction to a blended facial oil that has a nice texture, revitalises skin and is pretty affordable in the long run, because you don‚Äôt need very much. IN A NUTSHELL The Body Shop Oils of Life Intensely Revitalising Facial Oil is a blended facial oil that comes in 2 sizes ‚Äì 30ml and 50ml. The texture of the oil is quite oily so will sit better on those with dry skin, or those who live where the weather gets cold and dry. Massage about 2-3 drops into damp skin as a light serum, followed by a moisturiser or use it on its own if you prefer. I need a cream over it. The warm, musky scent is rather strong, so do take note of that if you are sensitive to scents of that nature. PROS: Light texture, Absorbs easily into damp skin, Makes dry skin feel more moisturised and more comfortable, Makes skin feel smoother and more comfortable with regular use, Revitalises dry skin, Quite affordable as you only need very little product each time CONS: Scent is rather strong WHO WILL LIKE THIS: Anyone with dry skin who‚Äôd like to try a more affordable facial oil to help their skin feel more comfortable, Anyone who lives where the weather gets cold and dry and wants an affordable blended facial oil PRICE: RM199 | ¬£30 for 30ml or RM269 | ¬£38 for 50ml WHERE TO BUY: The Body Shop stores or online For those interested, here is the full ingredient list Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride (Emollient), Olea Europaea Fruit Oil/Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil (Emollient), Simmondsia Chinensis Seed Oil/Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil (Skin Conditioning Agent ‚Äì Occlusive), Camelina Sativa Seed Oil (Emollient), Rosa Canina Fruit Oil (Skin Conditioning Agent), Camellia Oleifera Seed Oil (Skin Conditioning Agent ‚Äì Emollient), Nigella Sativa Seed Oil (Emollient), Parfum/Fragrance (Fragrance Ingredient), Tocopherol (Antioxidant), Pentaerythrityl Tetra-Di-t-Butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate (Antioxidant), Limonene (Fragrance Ingredient), Linalool (Fragrance Ingredient), Citronellol (Fragrance Ingredient), Geraniol (Fragrance Ingredient), Pelargonium Graveolens Flower Oil (Fragrance Ingredient), Rosmarinus Officinalis Leaf Oil/Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary Leaf ) Oil (Fragrance Ingredient), Origanum Majorana Leaf Oil (Refreshing Agent), Anthemis Nobilis Flower Oil (Fragrance Ingredient), Coumarin (Fragrance Ingredient), Lavandula Angustifolia Oil/Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil (Natural Additive), Lavandula Hybrida Oil (Fragrance Ingredient), Citral (Fragrance Ingredient), Citrus Aurantium Dulcis Peel Oil/Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil (Fragrance Ingredient) What is interesting is that this oil contains olive fruit oil, and my skin used to go bonkers on contact with olive oil. It was so bad that I‚Äôd avoid it completely in any product. But it works in this one, which tells me that it is either a better formula or that my skin has changed over time, so can now tolerate ingredients it could not before. That, I find interesting, for it reopens up a whole new world of experiences and products for me! üòÄ Have you tried anything from The Body Shop Oils of Life range? I‚Äôm kind of interested to have a go at their cream from the same range now. I have the essence, which I‚Äôll tell you about another day. I hadn‚Äôt paid a lot of attention to TBS for a while, but you know what? They‚Äôve improved a lot in recent years. Do let me know if there‚Äôs something else in the brand I‚Äôve missed that I should try! üòÄ Paris B</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Author</name><value><array><data><value><string>Paris B</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>2017-08-21 08:30:24</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>c7de-44fb-8840</string></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>5d4c91fb767ac3e54e1a8e3b2ae974f71dc467e0</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Author</name><value><array><data><value><string>Paris B</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>http://www.mywomenstuff.com/2008/05/whats-with-the-big-eye-contact-lens/</string></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>What‚Äôs with the Big Eye Contact Lens?</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>2008-05-06 09:37:51</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>c7de-44fb-8840</string></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>b2bd32a092ae67a3287318f40d3e55fec607b861</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Author</name><value><array><data><value><string>Paris B</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>http://www.mywomenstuff.com/2008/05/review-makeup-anna-sui-powder-eyeshadow/</string></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>Review: Makeup: Anna Sui Powder Eyeshadow</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>2008-05-08 09:08:08</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>c7de-44fb-8840</string></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>7daabd9b8c518e52c167ff5087aaedf47d8c0aa5</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Author</name><value><array><data><value><string>Paris B</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>http://www.mywomenstuff.com/2008/05/review-makeup-guerlain-terracotta-loose-kohl/</string></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>Review: Makeup: Guerlain Terracotta Loose Kohl</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>2008-05-12 09:29:13</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>c7de-44fb-8840</string></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>0d410b5266c36a4652f64f625ef8a1053a83d5b9</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>Chanel celebrates 90 years of skincare with Coco Chanel‚Äôs Huile de Jasmine Revitalizing Facial Oil</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>http://www.mywomenstuff.com/2017/07/chanel-huile-de-jasmine/</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>When facial oils step out of the shadows of niche skincare brands, into the glare of mainstream department store brands, you know they are a legitimate skincare category to be reckoned with. Quite a few department store brands now boast a bottle or two of a facial oil. Chanel now enters the fray with the Chanel Huile de Jasmine revitalizing facial oil with jasmine extract, raising the stakes somewhat. The Chanel Huile de Jasmine (Jasmine Oil) has just been made available at counters, but I‚Äôve been experimenting with it for almost 2 months now. I haven‚Äôt come across a lot of buzz about this, which I found surprising. Doesn‚Äôt the internet usually go a little crazy over everything new that looks imminently pretty and instagrammable? üòõ I think it‚Äôs because of the price point, and the rather exclusive availability ‚Äì only at Chanel boutiques, not all counters. Cynicism aside, I was very interested to have a go at it because you know how I feel about facial oils right? I love them! There‚Äôs always space in my stash for one more üòÄ I have to say though, that the packaging of the Chanel Huile de Jasmine is pretty much, on point. The minimalist bottle looks just like the one Chanel uses for their les exclusifs perfumes. The clear glass and sturdy black cap with the white label just screams luxury. Chanel says that this is a luxurious facial oil that is intended to revitalize skin, and it is a modern release of a jasmine oil formulated by Mademoiselle Coco Chanel 90 years ago, in 1927. Incidentally, it is with the jasmine oil that Chanel started their skincare line, 90 years ago. It is a blended oil, and does contain other ingredients aside from oil, so it isn‚Äôt quite as pure as other facial oils I use. I find the texture resembles a dry oil ‚Äì an oil that does not feel oily on the skin, but feels ‚Äúdry‚Äù. I can understand why this is so, because from speaking to many people, I‚Äôve realised that most people prefer that sort of non-oily oil texture, especially in our hot, humid, tropical weather. I personally prefer a texture that has a heavier, oilier feel, so texturally, I wasn‚Äôt so enamoured with this Huile de Jasmine. However, I will say that if you have oilier skin or combination skin, you will appreciate the texture, for it doesn‚Äôt make your skin feel oilier or heavier than it already does. I used it the same way I use my facial oils ‚Äì on dampened skin, as a ‚Äúserum‚Äù ‚Äì between my toner and moisturiser. There are different schools of thought when it comes to when to apply moisturiser. I treat my moisturiser as a ‚Äúseal‚Äù so it goes on last. Some people claim that oil is heavier and therefore should go last. Subscribe to whichever school of thought you prefer. It‚Äôs your skin! Or better yet, blend your oil into your moisturiser and take all the guesswork out of the equation LOL! üòÄ I found that the Chanel Huile de Jasmine absorbs very quickly into my drier skin, without leaving any greasy feeling. For this reason, I can even use it in the day if I wanted to. Because it is a very light textured oil, I found that I needed to use more product each time. In the evening, I‚Äôd use up to 5 drops, while in the mornings, I can use up to 3 drops quite comfortably. If you have oilier skin, use a little less. When I use more, and massage it into my skin, I find that it does help make my skin feel more moisturised, and comfortable. It doesn‚Äôt give me more of a glow than any other product, but it does not do anything untoward to my skin. It feels very comfortable, and like most facial oils, seems to rebalance my skin, so it doesn‚Äôt get too dry, nor too oily. However, I do have a problem with the packaging. The Chanel Huile de Jasmine is not dispensed by way of a dropper system, as with most facial oils I use. Neither is it a pump. There is a stopper with a hole, that allows you to shake out a few drops of oil into your palm. However, I find that this is an ineffective way to dispense the product. It is not easy to get the oil out of the bottle, and it can be frustrating. The first few times, before I got the technique right, I could hardly get anything out of the bottle. The other thing I‚Äôm not so crazy about is the inclusion of fragrance, and also the scent of jasmine oil. This is purely because I am not a fan of the scent of jasmine, which is fairly strong. It is a fresh scent of freshly plucked jasmine flowers, so if you love the scent of jasmine, you will be head over heels in love with this. If you apply the oil to your body or hair, (which you can, if you‚Äôre feeling lush) the scent of jasmine can linger. Perfect, if you love the scent. For me however, I prefer a more earthy scent, even with my facial oils, so I‚Äôm not too sold on it. If you‚Äôre new to using facial oil and want to know how else you can use it, try some of my tips here . You can also add a drop into foundation, which I love to do. If you have drier skin like I do, try it. It‚Äôs truly a game changer! IN A NUTSHELL The Chanel Huile de Jasmine Jasmine Facial Oil is a new facial oil by Chanel. The packaging is very minimalist and true to the luxury status of the brand. The oil is a blended oil, with a very lightweight texture that absorbs easily into the skin. It would sit well on those with oily skin or who live where it‚Äôs hot and humid as I do. For drier skin types, you may find that you need more to feel comfortable, as I do. The scent of jasmine is quite strong, so you must love the scent to fully appreciate the product. As with most facial oils, I do find that it boosts my skin moisture, and softens my skin. It is also lightweight enough to be blended into foundation. I am however, not a fan of the delivery system, as I feel it would work better with a dropper. PROS: Luxurious packaging, Very lightweight texture, Absorbs easily and quickly into the skin, Boosts skin moisture, Does not leave an oily or greasy feeling on skin, Rebalances and softens the skin CONS: Pricey, Not as pure an oil as some might prefer, Strong jasmine perfume scent may not appeal to everyone, Not easy to dispense the oil from the bottle WHO WILL LIKE THIS: Anyone who loves the scent of jasmine, Anyone who wants a lightweight, non oily oil that absorbs easily and quickly into the skin PRICE: RM550 | US$120 | ¬£97 for 50ml WHERE TO BUY: In Malaysia at Chanel standalone beauty boutiques only, Chanel.com and selected Chanel boutiques in other parts of the world Here is the ingredient list of the Chanel Huile de Jasmine facial oil. Did this facial oil intrigue you? Are you a fan of Jasmine scents? Personally I‚Äôm not a fan of floral or jasmine scents. That said, the scent does not linger on my skin and it isn‚Äôt too strong or cloying, so I can still enjoy using the product. Chanel is keeping this one very exclusive, so you‚Äôd have to check at their boutique, not your regular counter!

I didn‚Äôt realise how much of a cult status Hydraluron has attained, and I had only discovered it recently. Much of the hype has rolled out of the UK with skincare guru Caroline Hirons leading the charge, placing this product in her hall of fame and creating some sort of worldwide frenzy for it. I was curious about it, although I was also using a similar product under a different brand at the time. I didn‚Äôt even know Hydraluron was available here in Malaysia! That just tells you how unassuming it is and how little publicity it gets. Tsk! I picked this up one day when I happened to be in Sunway Pyramid, on which day I swear, there was a blue moon in the sky. Hydraluron hails from Canada under Indeed Laboratories and in Malaysia is found in just 1 store ‚Äì Muse by Watson‚Äôs ‚Äì in Sunway Pyramid. It is obscure and frustrating. It needs to be more widely sold so a) I can get hold of it if I need to replenish (I never go to Sunway) and b) more people can try it because it‚Äôs fab! Well, I say fab, because it is, but only because the other product which I think is more fab isn‚Äôt available here, and will cost you more. So for all intents and purposes, this is a fab little product that looks unassuming, gives skin that ol‚Äô boost it needs to plump up moisture and just makes skin look and feel better all around. Say it with me ‚Äì FAB! üòÄ As the name implies, Hydraluron is a Moisture Booster which contains our old friend hyaluronic acid in high quantities. What this also means is that if you have a known allergy or reaction to hyaluronic acid then this is not for you, no matter how much you want to try it. Some people have reported breaking out from products with too much hyaluronic acid which tells you that you can have too much of a good thing. The product comes in a small little unassuming tube in a large box. The packaging is pretty unassuming and I might even say clinical. It is one of those things that you will likely miss when scanning the shelves, because it just isn‚Äôt very impressive to look at. But do look again. I promise you, it‚Äôs worth your time. The product itself is a clear gel-liquid or is it a liquid-gel? Either way, it‚Äôs clear and has a slightly runny gel consistency, which makes it very easy to spread. Hyaluronic acid, if we didn‚Äôt already know, is the latest ‚Äústar ingredient‚Äù for trapping moisture in skin and attracting moisture, so it keeps the top layer of your skin plump and hydrated and this translates to better looking, clearer skin. I had realised that keeping my skin well hydrated is a key factor in keeping breakouts and dull skin at bay. It even helps scars and marks heal and fade more quickly as my skin heals more efficiently. However, I have to point out that Hydraluron is a serum NOT a moisturiser . Do not ask if you can just use this product in place of a moisturiser. You cannot. The way it works is to attract moisture and if you don‚Äôt apply any moisturiser over this, what is it supposed to attract then? Nothing, I‚Äôd warrant. So treat this as you will a serum. Apply it after cleansing and toning and before other serums, oils or moisturiser. Basically, think of it as a magnet. You want it on your skin to attract moisture from whatever else goes on top of it. I am sometimes perverse and apply it over other serums and it‚Äôs fine because I seal everything with oil and/or moisturiser anyway. If you aren‚Äôt as experimental as I am, stick to the Cleanse -> Tone -> Hydraluron -> Serum -> Moisturiser routine and you‚Äôll be ok. I was using this twice a day when I first bought it. Morning and night. But then I created too many skincare steps in the night, so I now use it primarily in the day when I feel my skin gets dehydrated more quickly from the sun, heat and air-conditioning. I cannot attest to my skin looking or feeling even better because as I said, I already use a similar hydrating serum in the day (Dr. Lewinn‚Äôs S8 Super Hydrator if anyone‚Äôs wondering. I am supposed to review it. I have 2 bottles on standby. That‚Äôs how much faith I have in it!) but my skin didn‚Äôt get any worse. It helps keep my skin plumped up and hydrated in the day and you know what that means right? Makeup goes on more easily and looks so much better. If you have oily skin try this anyway because I‚Äôve found that well hydrated skin can actually balance out your skin oils and help you have less oily skin. Besides, oily skin can also be dehydrated below the surface. If you have dry or dehydrated skin then this is what you need for boosting moisture in your skin. Give it a month of at least once a day use and you WILL notice the difference. I‚Äôve all but turned my skin around in the last 6 months, thanks to a daily routine of hydration and exfoliating and anti-aging and my skin is looking far better today than it ever did 5 years ago. Some day, I‚Äôll find the time and words to talk about it without gushing over myself LOL! üòõ To use, just squeeze out a dollop of product ‚Äì what you see in my picture above is about right. Spread it over your face. I find that it will feel a little tacky before it dries and settles. I don‚Äôt wait for it to dry to continue with my routine and neither should you. In a nutshell If you can get your hands on this, give this a go. Anyone can benefit from it, not just those with problematic skin. What Hydraluron does is boost your moisture with high hyaluronic acid content in a no fuss clear gel. It will help your skin look better, stay more hydrated, and that means fewer breakouts, less lines, faster healing time and better skin. On the other hand, if you can get Dr. Lewinn‚Äôs S8 Super Hydrator and can afford it, I prefer that one which serves primarily the same functions. Irrational or not, I like that one better, but if you can‚Äôt get it, then Hydraluron will do the job. Pros: Lightweight gel absorbs quickly into skin, Boosts moisture with high hyaluronic acid ingredients, Helps skin look and feel better and more hydrated, Affordable Cons: Hard to find in some parts of the world, May break out anyone who is sensitive to hyaluronic acid Who will like this: Anyone with dehydrated skin, Anyone who feels their skin needs that boost of moisture Here is the Hydraluron ingredient list. Have you tried Hydraluron and are you a fan? I have to say that it‚Äôs nice and although I didn‚Äôt notice too much of a difference to my skin because as I said, I already use a similar product, it does the job at a slightly smaller pricetag. My friend Juan is quite impressed as well and she has oily skin. It‚Äôs simple and effective and you know, when it comes to skincare that‚Äôs all that matters! Now, if only it was more easily accessible because I hate travelling cross state to get one bloody serum üòõ Paris B Hydraluron Moisture Booster serum Price: RM80/30ml Availability: Muse by Watson‚Äôs at Sunway Pyramid only</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Author</name><value><array><data><value><string>Paris B</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>2013-12-12 08:30:46</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>c7de-44fb-8840</string></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>1b8069ca89e4e88a6a961ed943fdedebe559b012</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>Nanoblur claims you‚Äôll look up to 10 years younger: Let‚Äôs see how it fares!</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>http://www.mywomenstuff.com/2014/09/nanoblur/</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>Alright, I‚Äôm conflicted. On the one hand, here is a product touting to make me look up to 10 years younger in 40 seconds and yet, my innate sense of of scepticism rears its ugly head with that raised eyebrow going ‚ÄúReally?!‚Äù I know, 10 years. That‚Äôs a heck lot of time to turn back (although personally, I‚Äôm not one for turning back time unless it‚Äôs to undo mistakes and boy, are there some I‚Äôd like to undo!) The product is Nanoblur by Indeed Labs, the people who brought us Hydraluron . What this is, is a product that purports to be based on optics technology and it‚Äôs not sold as a makeup, so it‚Äôs NOT a primer. I know, then what is it? Well, it‚Äôs a product that you apply on skin to correct the appearance of skin aging, lines, wrinkles, pores and it does this all within seconds. 40 seconds to be exact. Sounds like a primer? Yeah, I thought so too. I‚Äôve held on to this for over 2 months now, trying to get my head around it, but I‚Äôm afraid to say, quite failing to see how it fits into my routine. The thing is this. It works as it claims ‚Äì to a degree. If you have problems with lines or wrinkles and you want to just lessen the appearance of them then Nanoblur does the job. When you apply it on the lines, it almost magically blurs and looks significantly softer and less visible. Let me show you using the lines on the back of my hand. I tested this on the back of my wrist where you can quite clearly see the lines with nothing applied on the skin. A dab of Nanoblur applied, give it a few seconds, and can you see the lightened effect? Fine lines are smoothened while deeper lines are lightened. It‚Äôs pretty impressive, and if you can imagine this on your face, yes, it does lift the years off. But for enlarged pores, I didn‚Äôt find it as effective and as my face has less of a problem with lines than it does with pores, here is how it looks. I tested this on bare skin not over makeup, which I‚Äôll talk about in a bit. (1) Bare skin, some enlarged bores and shine on cheeks (2) Nanoblur applied on cheek area mattifies the skin a little and pores doesn‚Äôt look as noticeable but are still there (3) Pressed powder applied over Nanoblur When you use liquid foundation, Nanoblur says you should apply it OVER your liquid foundation where you need it. So don‚Äôt apply it all over your face unless you want to but you can tap it in on areas where you need it or see lines. This is important to note because if you wear it UNDER liquid foundation, it sucks. Boy, does it suck! I tried it and bleh! Wanted to scrub off my makeup immediately. When wearing powder foundation you can apply Nanoblur first and then apply powder foundation on top. This is especially if you notice that powder foundation settles into lines on your skin. Nanoblur gives you that base you need so it doesn‚Äôt. When I do use Nanoblur, I use it on bare skin, and then apply some pressed powder (I use the RMK Pressed Powder N ) over. The powder is translucent but it evens out my skintone well, as you can see above. It goes without saying therefore that if I do use it, I use this only on weekends when I don‚Äôt really want to put a base on, but want to just have better looking, more evened out skin. But I‚Äôm not a fan of Nanoblur. For me, it‚Äôs an additional step and an additional product that I don‚Äôt particularly see much use for. I might change my mind in about 5-10 years when the lines kick in but for now, I‚Äôm not sold on it. I personally think it benefits those who do have a problem with lines ‚Äì laugh lines, crows feet, forehead lines ‚Äì and want something that can soften the appearance of those lines visually. But if it‚Äôs not something that bugs you then this isn‚Äôt something you‚Äôd need. IN A NUTSHELL Nanoblur is a product that visually reduces the appearance of lines and wrinkles on skin very quickly so skin looks fresher and younger. It works over or under makeup depending on the type of makeup you use, and it does work as it says on the tin for lines. Lines are almost immediately softened and in the case of fine lines, almost seem to disappear. It also reduces the appearance of enlarged pores, but not as impressively as it does lines. I think it‚Äôs a good product for anyone who fits their target market, but it isn‚Äôt one for me. I‚Äôm kind of lazy and kind of unfussed about having lines or imperfections üòõ Pros: Affordable, Softens fine lines and wrinkles almost immediately as it claims, A little goes a long way Cons: A bit of a learning curve (pat it on skin, don‚Äôt spread) Who will like this: Anyone who wants to soften the appearance of lines and wrinkles on skin with or without wearing makeup Here is the ingredient list for Nanoblur which as you can expect contains silicones so if you are sensitive to silicone, please stay far away! Have you tried Nanoblur and did you like it? I think it‚Äôs great it exists, because I can imagine that it fills a niche that not many brands have thought to explore, since this is marketed not as makeup but as skincare. Tine and Shashay like it, for example. But for me personally, I‚Äôm not sold. I guess I‚Äôm just lazy üòõ Paris B Nanoblur by Indeed Labs Price: RM75/30ml Availability: Muse by Watsons at Sunway Pyramid or at Watsons online .</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Author</name><value><array><data><value><string>Paris B</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>2014-09-17 08:30:32</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>c7de-44fb-8840</string></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>83b5d95092fc620b3b248842e2162ed8d26d7966</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Author</name><value><array><data><value><string>Paris B</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>http://www.mywomenstuff.com/2012/02/wear-flowers-in-your-hair-and-spritz-melvita-floral-water-on-your-skin-for-a-refreshing-soothing-treat/</string></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>Wear flowers in your hair and spritz Melvita Floral Water on your skin for a refreshing soothing treat</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>2012-02-23 08:30:03</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>c7de-44fb-8840</string></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>fb2d19efa0507b7219f85627d35e4acb19f23e9b</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>Save &amp; Splurge: Coming up Roses ‚Äì The Rose Floral Water Facial Mists Edition</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>http://www.mywomenstuff.com/2014/09/save-splurge-rose-floral-water-face-mist/</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>I‚Äôm not the world‚Äôs biggest fan of rose scents but I cannot deny that the delicate scent of fresh rose blooms uplifts the spirit and makes me feel girly and happy. Rose water is also popular for use as a face mist, to hydrate skin, set makeup or just refresh yourself when it‚Äôs hot. I happen to be quite a fan of the Melvita Damask Rose Floral Water of which I‚Äôve already gone through about 2 bottles thus far, from the days when it came in a lovely glass bottle, till it‚Äôs current packaging in a plastic bottle. I like how soothing and comfortable it is on my skin and I use it primarily as a post-cleanse facial treat. But you know what? As lovely as it is, I found it pricey. I recently tried a new brand on a bit of a whim and to my surprise, I like it, and it‚Äôs very kind to my wallet. So here we have it ‚Äì a Save and Splurge post for rose floral waters. I haven‚Äôt done one of these for a long time have I? üòÄ SPLURGE: Melvita Damask Rose Floral Water ‚Äì RM122/200ml The splurge option will be the Melvita Rose floral water which I reviewed a while ago . It‚Äôs very nice. The scent of roses is not too strong, and is refreshingly of fresh roses. I find it hydrating on skin so you can use it as a hydrating toner after your cleansing and it cools and soothes the skin, while leaving it feeling lovely. Get this if: You want a certified organic product, You prefer a distilled rose floral water as opposed to one mixed with essential oil Buy it from: Melvita stores or Melvita online SAVE: Heritage Store Rose Petals Rosewater ‚Äì US$6.52 (Approx RM21)/240ml I was shopping iHerb.com one day when I somehow came upon this brand that received a lot of positive comments and reviews. I do use rose water mists quite a lot in my skincare routine, so I was intrigued, and ordered a bottle to try. I have to say, it‚Äôs lovely! The product comes in a pink plastic bottle, and the spray mist is fine and the mist is fine enough to hydrate and refresh the skin without leaving it feeling sopping wet. I usually use this after cleansing, as a hydrating treat and before I go on to my toners (although I use it after an exfoliating toner ‚Äì yes, my skincare routine is complex üòõ ) It seems to cool down my skin on hot days (I like to just mist my face with it for fun sometimes when I‚Äôm at home) and it refreshes. The scent of roses is quite strong but it isn‚Äôt cloying, just the fresh smell of blooms. You could use this any way that you‚Äôd normally use a face mist ‚Äì to set makeup, to refresh your skin, to mix with skincare to thin it, as a body mist if you like the scent that much‚Ä¶ possibilities are endless. The ingredients are just 2 ‚Äì Vor-mag water and Rosa Damescena (hydroessential rose) flower oil. Vor-mag water is supposed to be water that has been vortexed and magnetized to raise the energy to a higher vibration that they believe to be more beneficial. I find it esoteric so I‚Äôm discounting all benefits ascribed to it. All in all, as a rosewater facial mist, I‚Äôd say this is an excellent value. Get this if: You are on a budget, You don‚Äôt mind that it is a blend of water and essential oil Buy it from: iHerb.com (If you use my code MPW213 you get 5% off. This item is quite heavy but airmail shipping to Malaysia is $4 up to about 2kg and I‚Äôve shipped it together with some light items for that price. It takes a while to get here, but I‚Äôm fine with it. Otherwise, opt for the DHL shipping which is quicker) My Pick I will not call them dupes, because the composition of the products are different. Melvita uses a distillation process to obtain their floral waters and that I understand can add to cost. Also, Melvita is certified organic so you know where their products are coming from. If those matter to you then you will pick Melvita‚Äôs floral water. As for Heritage Store Rosewater, I like it because I can be lavish with it without feeling a pinch on my wallet. But I do have to order it online and it can take a while to get here (I‚Äôve seen it sold online locally for double the price. I‚Äôd take my chances with iHerb any day) so that‚Äôs one of its downsides. In a pinch therefore, I‚Äôd pick the Save option and go with the Heritage Store Rosewater because my wallet likes it. But if I were feeling flush (or green), then I‚Äôd go for Melvita which is easier to get locally. Do you use a rose water mist? Have you tried either of these? I use a floral water mist almost like a face prep for my skincare to follow. It seems to help with hydration and it seems to help products absorb more quickly into my skin thereafter. It also feels and smells nice so that might be the biggest incentive of them all! üòÄ Do you have a brand you like? Paris B Product prices and availability are as set out above within the post.

I am in the latter camp. Whenever I see (or rather, smell) a Lush store approaching, I take a deep breath, hold it and scurry past, gasping for air 50m down the road. I remember exiting the store at Covent Garden with a throbbing head after descending into the basement to pick up some items requested by friends. The strong co-mingled scents really got to me. It‚Äôs a wonder I didn‚Äôt pass out. Yet it was then that I discovered the one Lush item I enjoy using. Yes, after trying a few of their popular handmade soaps and not liking them very much, there is just one item I‚Äôd be happy to use. The Happy Hippy shower gel. If you love citrus scents, particularly that of grapefruit, in your body washes, you too will find yourself drawn to this shower gel which has a delightful fresh, zesty scent to it. Perfect for waking you up in the mornings, or just refreshing yourself after a long hot day. Lush prides themselves on not including preservatives in their products and making their products fresh, so I have found from experience that the colour of Happy Hippy can vary a little from a clear yellow to a cloudy darker yellow. Also, when I keep it a little longer than I should, it deepens a little more, but the zesty tang remains. The best part, I‚Äôd say, is that it doesn‚Äôt smell like dishwashing liquid, the way many citrus body washes tend to smell if they don‚Äôt get the formula quite right. I definitely get the slightly bittersweet smell of grapefruit zest in there, as well as a citrus lemon base. It doesn‚Äôt last, however. Doesn‚Äôt bother me. It also doesn‚Äôt lather up a lot, which again doesn‚Äôt bother me. I used to buy the 100ml bottles whenever I see it because I‚Äôd toss them into my travel pouches. When I travel, I‚Äôve found that this is one of the best pick-me-up scents especially if you‚Äôve had a long travel time and are feeling dead on your feet. Another good thing about taking this travelling is that you can use it for your hair too, which makes it very practical if you‚Äôre going somewhere far and don‚Äôt want to carry too many toiletries with you. The downside however, is that I do find it a little drying so I can‚Äôt use it daily. Ditto for the hair. It will dry out your hair if you don‚Äôt condition but in a pinch, it does a good enough job that I won‚Äôt complain. Out of everything available at Lush, this is the one item I‚Äôd ever voluntarily purchase from them. Everything else is just too strongly and sweetly scented for my delicate nose üòõ In a nutshell The Lush Happy Hippy shower gel has a fresh citrus and grapefruit scent that is refreshing and uplifting to the senses any time of day. It can also be used for the hair which makes it practical when trying to travel light. The downside is that it does tend to feel a little drying on skin and hair if used too often. Pros: Fresh and uplifting citrus scent, Can be used for hair and body, Comes in various sizes including a travel friendly 100ml bottle Cons: Pricey, Can feel a little drying on skin and hair if used too often, Colour of product will change over time Who will like this: Anyone who likes fresh citrus scents in their body wash Here is the ingredient list for Happy Hippy which is supposed to be Vegan friendly. Mine is a little old hence the deeper colour you see in my pictures. I have noticed that it gets this way when stored for a while, which I believe is due to oxidisation. When fresh in store, it usually has a light to medium yellow colour in a slightly cloudy gel. I do find it rather pricey, but since we don‚Äôt get it locally, it‚Äôs a nice treat whenever I do brave myself to step into a Lush store. But I‚Äôd only ever buy the 100g bottles because I don‚Äôt use it enough. Have you tried Happy Hippy? Do you like anything from Lush or does the store give you a headache too? Thus far, this is the only non headache inducing product I‚Äôve used from Lush to date. I‚Äôm not terribly sold on their face or soap products, especially as many of their face products have to be kept in the fridge to avoid spoiling in our weather. So although I did like using Angels on Bare Skin , I never repurchased because of the hassle.

In my defence, I now use hydrating toners because they help my skincare go on better and hey, anything that helps my skin look better is a good thing! Being something that I use up quite quickly, I was pleased when recently introduced to one from an affordable brand ‚Äì O‚Äôslee Rosehip Beauty Solution Advanced Formula III . No, I‚Äôve no idea what I and II were like. For something that retails at RM59.90 I was quite pleased to see that it came in a nice hefty frosted glass bottle. Sure, lots of people will say ‚ÄúGlass is so heavy! It might break!‚Äù to which my reply is ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be so clumsy then‚Äù üòõ But honestly, I like products that come in glass bottles. The O‚Äôslee Beauty Solution is essentially a hydrating toner. It claims to add moisture to skin, whiten, refine pores, reduce blackheads, neutralize free radicals, soften skin to promote product absorption and be relaxing. Whew! Is there nothing this wonder multi-tasking liquid can‚Äôt do? Naturally, I had to see if this does fulfill all its promises! Short answer. No. What this product is, is a lotion/toner/softener. In this respect, it does a decent enough job. I usually saturate a cotton pad with the clear rose-scented liquid and then wipe it over my cleansed face, and then lightly pat it in. Then, I follow up with my serums and potions. As a toner/lotion/softener, it works. My skin feels refreshed and it isn‚Äôt drying. If you aren‚Äôt the sort to use a cotton pad, then pouring some lotion into your palm and then patting it on your skin does the same job. It isn‚Äôt quite as liquid as water. There is some slight viscosity to it, and it leaves skin feeling almost immediately nice and hydrated. Basically, don‚Äôt buy this lotion for its numerous claims. Get it if you want an affordable hydrating lotion because it does do a fair job in this department. You can also use this as a quick mask. If you soak some cotton pads, or a paper mask in the lotion, it can help refresh your skin. However, I find it dries too quickly to work as a mask for me. There are however, 2 things I don‚Äôt quite like about it. The first is the obvious rose scent. I find it too strong. It does smell of fresh roses and all that, but I don‚Äôt like my facial products having too strong a floral scent. It throws me off because I start thinking I should be spraying it on as a perfume instead. It‚Äôs that strong. The second thing I‚Äôm not crazy about is the hole dispenser. It doesn‚Äôt pour out too much product, which is a good thing, but it also doesn‚Äôt pour out enough each time. So, I have to shake the bottle to dispense enough lotion to saturate my cotton pad. Also, I have to get the cotton pad very well saturated, because otherwise, it doesn‚Äôt glide over my skin nicely. So, as a product, it is a fair cop. It serves its purpose to quickly refresh the skin while adding some moisture, and it does soften the skin somewhat. I can‚Äôt measure all those other claims so I‚Äôll just tell you take them with a grain of salt. It is a decent enough product, and I‚Äôll finish this, but its not something I‚Äôd repurchase. It just doesn‚Äôt wow me. But if I needed something affordable this does the job just fine. In a nutshell The O‚Äôslee Rosehip Beauty Solution is a lotion that acts as a hydrating toner for skin, before you put on your serums and moisturiser. I find that it does work quite well. It doesn‚Äôt smell unpleasant even if the rose scent is a bit too strong for my tastes, and it feels comfortable on my skin. It however doesn‚Äôt quite hydrate my dry skin as well as other products I‚Äôve tried and while I‚Äôm comfortable enough with finishing this bottle, it isn‚Äôt something I‚Äôd repurchase, because it doesn‚Äôt do much for my skin. Pros: Affordable, Hydrates and refreshes skin, Can be used as a quick mask Cons: Strong rose scent, Hole dispenser doesn‚Äôt dispense enough product each time Who will like this: Anyone in the market for an affordable hydrating lotion/toner/softener Here‚Äôs the ingredient list:- I also realised why I was a little hard on this toner. It is pretty decent, make no mistake. But I started using this after being wowed by the Estee Lauder Nutritious lotion that I‚Äôd finished up, and am too stingy to replenish. It looks like I might have to, some time. I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm missing a toner! Have you tried this Beauty Solution before? Have you used any product by O‚Äôslee? This was my first time actually. I‚Äôd seen the products at the pharmacy before and they are mostly quite affordable. I think they come in from Hong Kong and I may be open to trying others in the line.

been wanting to tell you about the Real Techniques Expert Face Brush for a while now, but kept putting it off. Recently, when I shared the super efficient liquid foundation application tutorial , quite a few of you expressed an interest in using or owning a face brush, and specifically, in the Shiseido Perfect Foundation brush which I had been raving about before. If I‚Äôm to be honest, its not the most expensive brush you‚Äôll buy, at just RM95 and it‚Äôll last you a long long time. But I know some of you operate on a budget, so here‚Äôs a good alternative for a face/foundation brush ‚Äì the Real Techniques Expert Face Brush . Before I send you on a wild goose chase (because I do like this brush a lot too!) I must tell you that I have no idea where its available locally or if its available at Shins where some other Real Techniques brushes have been spotted. I‚Äôll tell you below where its available online but if you know whether it can be found here, please share the info! Real Techniques by Samantha Chapman is a range of makeup brushes created with one half of the sisters running the Youtube/beauty blogger/makeup artists channel, Pixiwoo. I don‚Äôt personally watch Youtube beauty videos but I have watched some Pixiwoo videos and they are easy to follow and understand. None of the rambling you get with some other vloggers. If I were to do video, I‚Äôd ramble on so long, I‚Äôd forget what the subject matter was. Rather like what my posts are like üòõ But I digress! (as usual) What is it about the RT Expert Face Brush then? At the height of the raves when the Real Techniques line was first launched, I purchased a set of Real Techniques Core Collection brushes which come as a set of 4 face brushes. The yellow aluminium bodies tell you at a glance that these brushes are face brushes. Very helpful colour coordination, that! The only brush from the Core Collection that I ever really used or liked, was the Buffing Brush. Its why I never blogged about the Core Collection. I wasn‚Äôt terribly impressed despite all the raves. The Buffing Brush was meant for powder foundation or mineral foundation and as the name implies, is to be used in a buffing motion, to give a flawless, full coverage finish. I however, would use it to apply liquid foundation, or to buff or blend liquid foundation and it works well! The synthetic bristles are soft against the skin and the head is dense enough yet pliable enough to give a smooth, even finish to any foundation you apply on skin. So, when I came upon the stand alone Expert Face Brush , I was a little curious if it was similar. It did look rather similar. At the princely sum of US$9 I just had to pick it up and give it a go. Well, colour me impressed! The Expert Face Brush is nothing like the Buffing Brush so if you are thinking of owning both, go right ahead. The head of the brush is more dense and tightly packed, it is structured to be a little more flat, and the shorter bristles mean that there is less give and its less pliable. The slightly flatter structure mean its easier to buff and blend product and to get into the crevices around the nose and eyes etc. The synthetic bristles are soft and dense and it doesn‚Äôt hurt your skin even if you buff product in. I have tried the 5-line liquid foundation application technique with this brush and it works a treat and here‚Äôs the deal, is even quicker than using a flat paddle brush! So far, this is my favourite brush to use alongside the flat top foundation brushes that I own. Here are some comparison photographs to show you the differences between the Expert Face Brush and the Buffing Brush. You can see that the Buffing Brush is rounder and the bristles are longer. It is also less dense and works well for liquid or powder foundation, giving a lovely flawless finish. The Expert Face Brush doesn‚Äôt work as well for powder foundation, but it works very well for liquid or creamy foundation, similarly giving an even, flawless finish to skin. Used with the application technique I showed you before, this, its quick and quite flawless. The upside of these brushes, price aside, is that I find them much easier to clean than the Shiseido Perfect Foundation brush, which is a pain in the @$$ üòõ For me, I find that as the brush isn‚Äôt as dense as the Shiseido one, its easier to get into the bristles and clean them. The smooth synthetic bristles are also easy to wash and dry. One more difference between the Expert Face Brush and the Buffing Brush lies in the base. The Expert Face Brush is a standalone brush and quite literally, can stand alone. The base is widened so you can stand it unassisted on your dresser. Not quite sure why you‚Äôd do so, but you can if you want. The brushes that come in the set don‚Äôt have this widened base and therefore are not stand alone (hur hur üòõ ) So in a nutshell, get this if you‚Äôre on a budget. Or even if you‚Äôre not on a budget. Its a good brush to have in your arsenal üôÇ In a nutshell The Real Techniques Expert Face Brush is a synthetic brush made for application of liquid or cream foundation. The dense slightly domed brush head makes it easy to apply and blend foundation in a buffing motion, and the soft dense bristles give skin a flawless appearance with minimal to no streaking if you do it right. Its an excellent brush, both in terms of use, application and price and worthy to have in anyone‚Äôs brush arsenal. Some people have mentioned that their brushes shed but I didn‚Äôt experience any shedding despite having washed it numerous times. Maybe I got lucky. Pros: Bristles and soft against skin, Light handle yet well weighted when held, Bright body colour makes the brush easy to spot in your collection, Dense bristles buff product well giving a smooth, flawless appearance, Affordable Cons: Not easily available Who will like this: Anyone who needs a liquid/cream foundation brush, Anyone on a budget Now for the $64,000 question. Where is this available? As I said, I don‚Äôt know about local availability. If it is, please let us know where you‚Äôve seen it. Some other RT brushes including the sets are available in Shins (I know only of a store in MidValley Megamall). Depending on where you are in the world, you can find a list of places to buy Real Techniques brushes here . Not listed, is iherb.com where you can pick up a brush or two while shopping for your health supplements (You can use my iherb code MPW213 to get 5% off your order) üôÇ Also note that I‚Äôve realised that Real Techniques brushes sold on UK websites are substantially more expensive than on iherb so if you can, buy off iherb. I bought mine from HQHair which I no longer recommend for shipping to Malaysia because shipping used to be reasonably priced and even free but they now charge an astronomical wallet-busting sum of ¬£18.99! So avoid at all costs. Do you own the Real Techniques Expert Face Brush? Have you used any other Real Techniques brushes and do you like them? I have the Core Collection (which I find meh) and the Blush Brush (also meh because its far too big) and this Expert Face Brush and the last one is the best of all I‚Äôve tried so far. Definitely hits or misses with the brand.

They aren‚Äôt terribly exciting if I‚Äôm to be honest, but they work when they have to and that, for me, is most important. I‚Äôve tried some of their foundations over the years and they generally work for me BUT I‚Äôd never tried the iconic Revlon Colorstay Makeup foundation. I know its popular, but I‚Äôd try it at the counter and the thick texture doesn‚Äôt endear itself to me. Its like everything that I NEVER wanted in a liquid foundation üòõ Recently, I received a bottle and I thought ‚ÄúOh hey, here we go. My chance to try this iconic product‚Äù What I didn‚Äôt realise was that Revlon has now come up with 2 different Colorstay Makeup Foundations. The existing one is now meant for those with normal-dry skin and this new one is for combination-oily skin. What this new Combination-Oily texture means is that it feels lighter in texture and also on skin. I initially didn‚Äôt like it. I tried it for a few days and found it drying initially despite the really long lasting coverage. So I set it aside. 2 months later, I picked it up again and for some weird reason, it now works for me. Have I normalised my skin that much from dry to combination? I don‚Äôt know but now, it doesn‚Äôt feel drying on my skin anymore! I think I just didn‚Äôt use as much. Before I show you why I like it, let me show you one thing I absolutely dislike. There is no pump. Gah! Revlon, please do something about this! Pretty much like the original Colorstay Makeup foundation, there is no pump to this glass bottle, just a big gaping hole. I think this is a pretty decent product and would be much improved with the inclusion of a pump. I‚Äôm surprised Revlon hasn‚Äôt worked it out over the years. They do have other liquid foundations with a pump e.g. Age-defying DNA foundation so this regression boggles my mind. I however, learned a nifty trick from RMK foundations that have a similar mind-boggling packaging. Cover your palm over the bottle mouth, up end the bottle and use just whatever is on your hand. I use the 5 line foundation application technique and its enough. If you try to pour it out, you will end up pouring out too much and wasting product. Ok, griping aside, I like this foundation now. Perhaps it was my technique before or maybe I was using too much but the 5 line technique really works wonders. Also, I was sent the foundation in 200 Nude which is actually a tiny tiny bit deep for me. Just a tiny bit. I believe I‚Äôm usually more suited to Buff which is a shade we never see here üòõ Also, I believe there‚Äôs a shade down in 180 Sand Beige but that‚Äôs a bit yellow toned as opposed to Nude which has a more pinky tone (more suited to my skin) So dissection aside, I find that the 5 line application technique allows me to wear Nude quite comfortably without it looking too deep on my skin. I find that the texture is a little thick but on skin once you blend it out, it doesn‚Äôt feel heavy which is something I appreciate. It stays on impressively well all day, leaving my skin looking like my skin but better all day long. I‚Äôve stopped experiencing dryness, maybe because I now use a lot less product than before. Here‚Äôs how it looks on my skin, before and after. It just looks better doesn‚Äôt it? Covers up redness and most blemishes and even evens the pigmentation spots on my cheekbones. Doesn‚Äôt cover them of course, I still use concealer for that, but I like how much more even my skin looks when wearing this foundation. Its only a very thin layer as anyone using that 5-line method will testify so I‚Äôd say coverage is very good üôÇ Here‚Äôs how 200 Nude compares with other foundations that suit my skintone. Left-Right: (1) Revlon Colorstay Whipped Mousse foundation 220 Nude (2) Revlon Colorstay liquid foundation 200 Nude (3) Revlon Age Defying DNA 10 (4) Shiseido Perfect Refining Foundation I00 Very light Ivory (5) Diorsnow Liquid Foundation 010 Ivory Other than the Diorsnow Ivory which looks a tad lighter, the rest are very close! I intentionally benchmarked it against other Revlon foundations I have and use and you can see that the Colorstay Liquid Foundation in 200 Nude is a bit lighter than the Whipped Mousse foundation in 220 Nude and also a little lighter than Age Defying DNA 10 Buff. I do wish Revlon would standardize their naming conventions üòõ This way I don‚Äôt have to keep playing Russian Roulette üòõ Oh there‚Äôs SPF6 but its so low, I didn‚Äôt even think it worth mentioning üòõ UPDATE: SPF will be upgraded to SPF15 very soon! Watch out for the new packaging! So I really like the longevity, the non-oily, lightweight texture and how my skin looks when I have it on. I may prefer if the shade was a touch lighter, but Revlon has to work on packaging. Buck up! üòõ In a nutshell Revlon has come up with a new lightweight formula for their iconic Revlon Colorstay Makeup Liquid Foundation for Combination-Oily skin. The texture feels lighter than the original version which is now for Normal-Dry skin. I initially found it a little drying on my slightly dry skin but when I recently tried it again, I found that my skin felt more comfortable. I think it may have been the amount I used. I only use very little now because the coverage is very good so it will take you very far. I dislike the non-pump packaging however, which I can imagine will put many people off. Put in a pump and this will definitely fly off the shelves. Pros: Lightweight texture, Good coverage, Very long lasting without fading or sliding off, Non oily texture Cons: No pump, Messy packaging, Can be a little drying for normal/combination skin if too much is used Who will like this: Anyone who is looking for a long lasting lightweight liquid foundation with good coverage Here is the ingredient list for anyone interested. Are you a fan of the Revlon Colorstay liquid foundation? Have you used the original version? I know many people have listed it as one of their favourite full coverage liquid foundations but, as I said, I never tried it because the heavy texture was off putting.

My skin decided to throw a major hissy fit in January where everything I used to do and use (I didn‚Äôt change any part of my regular skincare routine) no longer worked and I was breaking out like I was a teen again, yet experiencing serious dry skin. I knew I had to do something. I told you earlier about my toner + cotton pad rediscovery that helped me. Now, here‚Äôs something else I changed. I haven‚Äôt been using cleansing oils for over a month. Not using cleansing oils to remove my makeup and as part of a double cleansing routine is something really big for me. I‚Äôm such a cleansing oil evangelist and I‚Äôve used so many . It has been such a part of my skincare routine for so many years that it was almost impossible for me to just abandon it. But I did. Instead, I turned to using cream/milk cleansers. As luck would have it, I didn‚Äôt own any, except 2. The last time I used a cream cleanser, it was the Neutrogena one . Worked a treat but I didn‚Äôt replenish because‚Ä¶ you guessed it; I went back to my oil cleansers. However, after rooting around, I discovered 2 ‚Äì Swissline Water Shock Comforting Emulsion Cleanser and Yves Rocher Hydra Vegetal Hydrating Cleansing Milk. I have been using them both this past month and I have to say that its different. My skin actually stopped feeling so dry and tight and it really seemed to help my skin feel more comfortable. Naturally, its also made me curious about trying other cream or milk cleansers üòÄ Do you use any? Interestingly enough, both the cream/milk cleansers I‚Äôve been using come in 2 different price categories üôÇ Splurge: Swissline Water Shock Comforting Emulsion Cleanser ‚Äì RM198/160ml The name of the product is that of Emulsion Cleanser but I feel that it is more of a cream. It pumps out quite thick, like a cream and applies on skin very much like a cream. It serves to remove makeup without drying out the skin and in fact, does a pretty decent job. I don‚Äôt use it about the eyes, because I use a separate eye makeup remover for the eye area (the same principles as that I‚Äôve explained before apply). With this one, I do not use a cotton pad. Instead, on dry face and with dry hands, I pump out about 2-3 pumps of the cleanser and massage it all over my face, giving myself a mini face massage as I go. I then rinse off or you can tissue off, and it leaves my skin feeling quite lovely and clean. Unlike oil cleansers that really deep clean, and sometimes leave skin feeling dry, this one leaves my skin feeling comfortable and hydrated. I do follow up with a foaming cleanser because it makes me feel more comfortable but you technically do not have to. I did realise however, that I could not use this one too often or I‚Äôd break out. I‚Äôm not quite sure why this is so but I‚Äôm good to use it about 2-3 times a week, but not too often. Not bad either because its terribly pricey! If I have heavier makeup on, its back to the oil cleansers I go. This one doesn‚Äôt do as good a job at removing long wearing makeup. (1) Swissline Water Shock Comforting Emulsion Cleanser (2) Yves Rocher Hydra Vegetal Hydrating Cleansing Milk You can probably tell from these swatches the difference in texture of the product. Save: Yves Rocher Hydra Vegetal Hydrating Cleansing Milk ‚Äì RM49.90 /200ml Unlike the Swissline Water Shock Emulsion Cleanser, I can‚Äôt use this cleansing milk without cotton pads. I‚Äôve tried it using just my hands to massage it into my skin but it seems to get absorbed and doesn‚Äôt make me feel like its doing a good job cleaning my skin of makeup. So, I dispense some product onto a cotton pad and then wipe it over my face. I do find that it does a fair job at removing most of my face base makeup but if its a longwearing product, then I do need more time to remove it. I also find myself having to go through quite a few cotton pads just to get my face clean and I do have to go over at least twice; but when I do, my skin feels very nice. It feels cool, hydrated and clean and I haven‚Äôt even washed it again yet üòõ As the name implies, the texture is more liquid and runny as opposed to the Emulsion Cleanser. It spreads quite easily on skin and when I use the cotton pad, I apply it in circles so my skin gets a little massage at the same time. It smells of the fresh green scent like the other Hydra Vegetal products and is just as affordable. My Pick Of the two, I‚Äôm going to pick the Yves Rocher cleansing milk simply because I can use it for weeks straight without experiencing any breakouts, and its affordable and works. I do think they are both fairly good products of themselves, and I do like the convenience of not having to use cotton pads with the Swissline emulsion and the nice creamy texture but I need something that I can use at a stretch without having to worry about breakouts and without hurting my wallet too much. I will also note that cream, milk or emulsion cleansers are usually targeted at those who have drier skintypes who will benefit from cleansing while hydrating the skin. I personally benefited from this and I‚Äôm starting to be sold on the idea of using milk/cream cleansers. Granted, it does now take me longer to remove my makeup and cleanse my skin, and I do have to do all the cleansing before I get into the shower and it can be quite a hassle, I have to continue because my skin has decided that for now, at least, this is what it wants. Ah! Fickle skin! Have you tried either product and have an experience to share? Do you have a cream / milk cleanser to recommend? I‚Äôd love to know if you are using a cream or milk cleanser and how you like it. I do still double cleanse; its just that I substituted the oil cleanser with a cleansing milk. I know this isn‚Äôt for everyone but when skin throws a hissy fit, sometimes its worth taking two steps back and trying something new. Thankfully this worked! üòÄ Paris B Swissline is a salon brand and products are available at Energy Day Spa and various other salons.

This is one of them. I forgot to take a picture of my lashes before use. Sigh‚Ä¶ So what I do have to show you is a picture of my lashes after about 1 month of using LashMantra. I‚Äôve got the usual stick straight, short sparse lashes quite common among those of Chinese stock. Previously, I‚Äôd tried using the Mavala Double Lash serum which worked to lengthen and thicken my lashes somewhat, but when I stopped, they too stopped and went back to their puny skinny selves faster than you can say ‚ÄúGet on a diet!‚Äù I was disillusioned to say the least. So when Leon of Lash Mantra offered to let me try her lash growth serum, I was a little sceptical. But try it I did, and yes, it works to lengthen and thicken my puny lashes, but not only that, the effect lasts even after I stop using it! This is the clincher for me! According to the website, ‚ÄúLashMantra is a 100% Natural Eyelash Growth Serum which is made with Eighteen 100% Pure Cold Pressed Oils and Vitamin E Oil (Antioxidants and Natural Preservative). LashMantra is free from Artificial Fragrance, Artificial Colorant, Parabens, Synthetic Preservatives and Chemicals, just perfect for your delicate eyes.‚Äù What this translates to for us is that its a natural lash growth serum. It comes in a serviceable looking bottle with dropper, a wand-brush all in a jute drawstring bag. There are 2 ways of using this:- Apply LashMantra with your fingers ‚Äì I drop 2 drops using the dropper into my left palm and lightly spread the serum between my index finger and thumb of my right hand and then apply on my eye lashes. You only need very little as its very liquid. If you‚Äôre impatient you could get some of the oil into your eyes. It won‚Äôt sting or burn but it will make your vision blurry which can be scary. Fortunately, its all natural oils and things were ok in a while. Apply LashMantra with the wand-brush ‚Äì A tube that looks like mascara is included but instead of a mascara wand, its a brush. Drop the serum into your palm then dip the brush into the serum and brush onto your lashes and the base. I tried this but prefer using my fingers because I get better control. Using the brush, I ended up with oily eyes most times. Results are expected after 2-4 weeks use. I can report slightly longer thicker looking lashes after about 1 month. Its imperceptible but I am used to paying attention to my lashes as I use mascara most days of the week. And what happened is that my lashes seemed to need less mascara and look longer after just one coat. Also, some new baby lashes seem to be growing in the sparse bits especially on the lower lash line where I had pretty much no lashes before. After about 1 month of use, I stopped using the LashMantra on purpose. I wanted to see what would happen to my lashes. Well, nothing happened. They stayed the same length and thickness and did not go all anorexic on me. Yay! So now that I‚Äôve gone past the 1 month use, I‚Äôm using LashMantra sparingly since I reckon I‚Äôm just maintaining lash length and volume and growth. Since I use a curler and mascara most days, I‚Äôm using this as a lash conditioner too. I saw that it can also be used for eyebrows so I might let my sister try it ‚Äì She had the no-brow look before Givenchy even thought about it! üòõ I wonder if it works for those with hair problems‚Ä¶ hmm‚Ä¶ üòÄ A 15ml bottle costs US$48 (inclusive of shipping) and Leon ships internationally. After 1 month, I‚Äôve hardly seen any dip in the bottle so my guess is this serum can last you a long long time. LashMantra says it should last up to 6 months. I say with usage every other day, it can take you up to a year, no problems. I reckon that US$48 is affordable if you are living in the USA or anywhere with a strong exchange rate to the USD. For us here in Malaysia, it can be considered a little pricey. However, when you consider that Mavala Double Lash costs about RM35 and the effects don‚Äôt last if you stop using it, then LashMantra might just be more worth it in the long run. Lash Mantra is available at www.lashmantra.com (not affiliated. Please purchase at your own discretion) Pros: Longer, Stronger thicker lashes with regular use, Lashes stay long and thick even after stopping, Natural oils do not irritate eyes Cons: Pricey by Malaysian standards, Vision can get blurry if you get oils in eyes What are your eyelash concerns? Despite all my efforts to grow them, my lashes will be nothing but stick straight and point right down. No natural curl here hence the use of the trusty lash curler before mascara.The bonus is that now after Lash Mantra I have slightly thicker and longer looking lashes, so any curl is emphasized and they seem to hold mascara better. What are your eye lash concerns if any? Stay beautiful, Paris B 29 Insightful comments ...

makeup collection</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>http://www.mywomenstuff.com/2017/03/chanel-energies-et-puretes-makeup/</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>I could apologise for coming in late with the limited edition Chanel Energies et Puretes le Blanc makeup 2017 collection . I could. But I won‚Äôt. I do wish brands would allow us consumers to catch our breath for a bit before throwing another large collection at us (and our wallets!) I was sent some select pieces from the collection (else I‚Äôd never have known of its existence!) so I‚Äôll do a quick post to show you what they are, and some quick thoughts on them, and if you‚Äôre truly interested, what I think is worth picking up (and what isn‚Äôt). The Chanel Energies et Puretes collection is actually part of the le Blanc collection (whitening) and usually, this invokes brightness and light. But this is Lucia Pica, who has turned Chanel makeup on its head (in my view, and for the better!) so the collection isn‚Äôt what I‚Äôm used to seeing for a blanc collection, as it has all these beautiful bright shades interspersed with depth. I also found out that this collection has only just launched in the USA and parts of Europe (Asia usually gets the Whitening stuff first and exclusively), so if you‚Äôre interested, here are the items and my thoughts on them. Chanel les 4 Ombres Eyeshadow Palette ‚Äì Jardins des Lumieres ‚Äì RM230 | US$61 There are 2 eyeshadow palettes in the collection ‚Äì Jardins des Lumieres and Jardins Eclatants. The one I have here is Jardins des Lumieres. Like all the (by now not so) newly formulated Chanel Les 4 Ombres eyeshadows, the quality is sublime. Soft and smooth to the touch and as pigmented as it gets. The shades in this palette are a mix of cool and warm tones, and apply very smoothly. I love that olive green in the top left and the beige in the top right. However, the purple just didn‚Äôt do it for me, and I felt that it was less buttery and pigmented than the other 3 shades. The other shade is a gunmetal grey. For me personally, the colours in this palette did not work for me. I would never have picked it up for myself because I can‚Äôt work with purple shades. I also found that the purple had a tendency to apply rather muddy. Perhaps it‚Äôs just me not having the right skill-set to work with these colours. If you like colours like these, I think you‚Äôd like this one. You can wear them from day to night quite easily, as the 2 lower colours are deeper than the top layer. I‚Äôm not sold on this one but it‚Äôs primarily due to the colour selection, less so the quality. Chanel Rouge Coco Shine ‚Äì Rose Ravissant, Rouge Lumiere ‚Äì RM120 | US$37 These are the 2 bullet lipsticks in the picture above and come in the Rouge Coco Shine formula. This is the sheerer, balmier, more translucent counterpart to Rouge Coco . I like lipsticks like these (as much as I enjoy my creamy opaque reds) so the formula sat well with me. It‚Äôs not drying and the sheer, balmy colour is easy to wear for everyday. Rose Ravissant is the rosy, almost coral toned lipstick, and Rouge Lumiere is the red. Much to my surprise, I really liked how Rose Ravissant looked on me, and you know how I feel about red lipstick! üòÄ You thought I‚Äôd pick the red didn‚Äôt you! LOL! If you are afraid of wearing bright red lipstick, take a look at Rouge Lumiere. The formula makes it an easier red to wear and ease yourself into the world of red lipstick üòÄ All limited edition colours I‚Äôm afraid (I‚Äôm not familiar enough with the whole range to pick out dupes) but I‚Äôd say these are worth looking into. Chanel Rouge Allure Gloss ‚Äì Vibration ‚Äì RM120 | US$37 Vibration is a bright bright pink coral that gives you such a bright, vibrant pop of colour on your face! I swear, when you wear it, that‚Äôs all anyone would notice, so save your trouble and keep your eyes simple LOL! I love the Rouge Allure Gloss formula, and this one is no exception. Think of this, not as a gloss, but as a creamy liquid lipstick. It‚Äôs beautiful, and this will wear well into Summer as the weather warms up, and the sunlight takes on a more golden hue. Beautiful! Chanel Plisse Lumiere de Chanel ‚Äì RM250 | US$70 If there‚Äôs one item from this collection that will fly off the shelves, it will be the Plisse Lumiere de Chanel. The highlighter. This limited edition champagne powder highlighter has embossed, a pleated design which is spposed to invoke images of washi tape. Planner and washi tape fans, this one is for you LOL! This palette has been swatched a few times, but as you can see, the embossing is still near perfect. That tells you two things. One, use your makeup not just stare at it! Two, you only need very little. I don‚Äôt use highlighter a lot, but I can understand why this one is popular. The aesthetics aside, the texture is creamy and it is shiny but not sparkly (there‚Äôs a very subtle difference) and you don‚Äôt need very much to achieve that touch of shine on your cheekbones, if you‚Äôre into the look. If you don‚Äôt have a highlighter in your collection then this would be one you‚Äôd like to look at. It‚Äôs pretty and functional. But if you already have a highlighter, you won‚Äôt need this one. Unless you want something to gawk at üôÇ It comes with a half-moon brush but I don‚Äôt use it. Maybe it‚Äôs functional, maybe it isn‚Äôt. I won‚Äôt know sorry. Chanel Les Tissages Tweed Cherry Blossom ‚Äì RM185 | US$48 There are 2 limited edition shades ‚Äì Tweed Cherry Blossom (pink) and Tweed Coraline (coral). I‚Äôll be honest and tell you that the Les Tissages de Chanel blushes are one of my least favourite Chanel makeup items. I still remember when Chanel first launched them in 2008 , and I owned a couple. While I loved it the first time around, I found that they didn‚Äôt age well (dries and hardens up something awful and becomes very hard to pick up colour), and they had a tendency to apply with a lot of chunky glitter and the quality was always fairly inconsistent. I may have a few ‚Äúvintage‚Äù ones lying around, but I don‚Äôt use them anymore. I prefer the Joues Contraste (round pans) ones in terms of quality. But I‚Äôm not here to reminisce. This is Tweed Cherry Blossom, which looks like, I don‚Äôt know, bacon? LOL It reminds me a little of the Hourglass Diffused Heat blush. The one that looks like bacon LOL! Tweed Cherry Blossom is a fairly bright pink so you do need a light hand. I do find for some reason, that the glitter really sticks to the skin with this one, so if you‚Äôre using both this blush and the Plisse de Lumiere highlighter, it is actually too much. You‚Äôll see what I mean below. On my lighter skintone (Chanel foundation No. 10), I have to use a fairly light hand and just tap on the blush, and tap it on skin. So I think those with a medium skintone might be able to pull this one off more easily. On deeper skintones, the challenge would be the pale bits, which may be too ‚Äúbright‚Äù and can look off. It‚Äôs a very delicate balance. Oh and that brush in there? Toss the damn thing. It feels and looks like dried straw tied in a bundle and scratches the skin to bits. Ugh. You can afford to give us better quality mini brushes, Chanel! And after all that, here are the swatches for all the items I‚Äôve shown you here. Didn‚Äôt I tell you that the bright Rouge Allure Gloss in Vibration will drag your eye there first? LOL As I told you as well, the Rouge Coco Shine lipsticks in Rouge Lumiere and Rose Ravissant are fairly sheer. I‚Äôll say that they aren‚Äôt must haves because sheer lipsticks are easily duped. But if you‚Äôre angling to treat yourself, then do take a look. Rouge Lumiere in particular, is a nice way to learn how to wear red lipstick and you can soon sport my signature red lipped look! üòâ The Jardins de Lumieres eyeshadow swatches very nicely, but I somehow feel that the purple and grey jar a little. I love the olive and beige shades. I don‚Äôt love the other two shades which on me, looked muddy. Plisse Lumiere de Chanel swatches with an almost molten metal champagne glow, but it is a lot less intense when you use a fluffy brush and a light hand. It‚Äôs not glittery but it can be easy to overdo it if you aren‚Äôt careful. And finally, that bright pink is the Les Tissages Tweed Cherry Blossom , which is a bright bright pink! Use a light hand on fair skins but on medium skintones, it‚Äôd look amazing. Here‚Äôs how some of the products look on me. I have the eyeshadow on, but you can‚Äôt tell and I‚Äôm not proud of the way they looked either, unlike the Codes Subtils palette I hunted down . On cheeks is the Tweed Cherry Blossom with a very light hand, topped with the Plisse Lumiere de Chanel. Too much shine? Yes indeedy! I toned it down after this, with some powder, when I saw this LOL üòõ On lips is Rouge Coco Shine in Rose Ravissant. It‚Äôs such a pretty day-to-day sort of colour. Easily duped, I‚Äôd agree. So save it for a treat üôÇ Did you happen to check out this collection by Chanel? Is there anything in here that is giving you the heart-eye emoticon? LOL My picks would be the Plisse Lumiere de Chanel, the Rouge Coco Shine in either Rose Ravissant or Rouge Lumiere and Rouge Allure Gloss in Vibration. I‚Äôm not sold on either the blush (texture) or the eyeshadow (colours). In general, this isn‚Äôt one of my favourite collections from Chanel.

They may not be the most exciting makeup brand, but they make good makeup, sometimes with pretty powders, and that to me, is better than a bunch of mediocre and overhyped products being churned out every 2 weeks. While we have a ways to go yet (I think it‚Äôs expected on our shores in July or September ‚Äì I can‚Äôt recall which. But we‚Äôll see it eventually) Clarins has dropped 2 limited edition makeup products that you can check out right now. It‚Äôs being released for Mother‚Äôs Day that‚Äôs coming up very soon so if you‚Äôre thinking of getting something for Mom (or for yourself ‚Äì really, who‚Äôs counting?!) you can consider these. They are the Clarins Skin Illusion Blush and the Clarins Daily Energizer Lovely Lip Balm , both of which are limited edition and available while stocks last at counters and on the website, for those of you who prefer shopping online (like me!) üôÇ Their release in line with Mother‚Äôs Day is apt, considering the love and kisses design, and it is also quite user-friendly for those who struggle with wearing makeup. Let me run them both down for you and you‚Äôd be glad to know that they both slip in comfortably under RM100! üôÇ Clarins Daily Energizer Lovely Lip Balm / Joli Baume Eclat du Jour ‚Äì RM79 | ¬£16 | US$20 This is a lip balm. Naturally therefore, I was less interested, because I don‚Äôt wear lip balm and am not a big advocate of it. But for the sake of experimenting, I tested it, and that‚Äôs when I got a nice surprise. While this is a lip balm that goes on clear, it also adjusts to the pH of your lips (apparently) to impart some colour! That was what surprised me. I get quite a lovely tint of natural colour on my lips. It isn‚Äôt bright nor bold, and really, it is just a hint on my lips. But it is enough to make you look a little more polished. The balm is also very comfortable, imparting a natural shine to the lips, while moisturising and keeping lips feeling very comfortable without being slick or sticky. But there is something I don‚Äôt like about it, rather unfortuntely, and that is the very strong peach scent. If you like sweetly scented or fruit-scented products, then you won‚Äôt mind this and might even like it. I however don‚Äôt. So, as much as I enjoyed the product, my experience was spoilt by the peachy scent that will not go away üôÅ The lip balm also comes in an adorably packaged cardboard case, in keeping with the fun vibe of the product. As a product, I think it‚Äôs not only effective, it‚Äôs fun. But only if you like the scent of peaches that close to your nose üòõ I love eating peaches, but don‚Äôt really relish smelling of one. Clarins Skin Illusion Blush ‚Äì RM85 | ¬£16 | US$21.50 The Clarins Skin Illusion Blush comes in 3 shades ‚Äì 01 Luminous Pink, 02 Luminous Coral and 03 Golden Havana . The product I have featured here is 01 Luminous Pink, which is a shade I particularly liked using. One of the first things you should pick up when the Clarins makeup line relaunches here, is their blushes. I own quite a few from waaaay back, and they are such underrated beauties. They may not be the most exciting products to look at, but they impart the most beautiful glow on the skin, and don‚Äôt demand your arm, leg and kidneys like some brands do (to be fair, I don‚Äôt know the new prices so they may now demand one kidney. I‚Äôm not sure üòõ ) The Skin Illusion Blush is cute. The design isn‚Äôt new, but it has quite an adorable packaging. Basically, what you get is a sponge puff applicator and the powder blush is embedded into the cover. When you screw the packaging together, the puff picks up the product from the blush, and saturates it for the next time you want to use it. It‚Äôs not new, nor unique, but it has proven to be quite handy. The sponge is rather dense, so there is a nice bounce when you pat it on your skin. It is also a good size, not being too big nor too small. What this basically is, is good for women on the go, who may want a little touch up. This is something you‚Äôd throw into your daily makeup pouch for quick touch-ups after lunch or before dinner, or perhaps after your session at the gym. The mirror in the top of the cover, although small, is quite useful in this regard. In terms of colour, I found 01 Luminous Pink to be a rather warm pink. For a moment, I thought that it was a coral, because it has a warmth running through it. It isn‚Äôt very pigmented when you swatch with your fingers, which I can tell you, is a good thing when you have to deal with packaging like this. In this swatch, I dabbed the sponge on my arm about 2-3 times to get the colour to show up. As you can see, the shade is a rather warm pink with peach undertones. The Daily Energizer Lovely Lip Balm swatches clear, but has adjusted a little to my skin, taking on a slight peach tone as well. To use the Clarins Skin Illusion Blush, you unscrew the sponge, and gently dab it on your cheeks. Because the colour isn‚Äôt very strong, it allows you to gently dab to layer and get the intensity you want. However, I will warn you that the colour seems to intensify after a little while on my skin, so don‚Äôt be overzealous. You will however, need to soften the edges, or you will get a line as you will see below. So, use a brush to gently blend out the edges of the ‚Äústamp‚Äù if you have one, or if not, do what I did and use your fingers. Just lightly blend out the edges, and it‚Äôll be perfect. If you see the photo below, the colour looks a little harsh, before blending out, and that is what you risk when you just use the sponge puff stamp directly on your skin. But just blend out the edges and you‚Äôll be good. You may also notice what I mean when I say the colour develops on me ‚Äì it looks deeper and brighter than it did the first time I applied it. You can also use a brush to pick up colour from the pan in the cover, but really, that defeats the purpose of portability and convenience doesn‚Äôt it? Perhaps Clarins could have designed this with a brush, but then I‚Äôd probably have complained that it was scratchy LOL! The sponge puff is soft, at least. I found that I did not have to pick up additional colour for both cheeks. The blush is, as I‚Äôve noted, not intensely pigmented, but pigmented enough to show up on my skin, and the puff picks up just the right amount of colour without fall out. If you have deeper skintone than mine, then you may find that you need more product, or perhaps a deeper colour. I did not notice any sparkles in the product which is mostly matte on me, and while I‚Äôve seen references to this Skin Illusion Blush as a highlighter colour, I‚Äôd beg to differ, because of how the colour develops on my skin. I like using it on its own, and it is fairly long lasting over a good base. No complaints at all, except that the design and packaging isn‚Äôt something I‚Äôd normally go for. But for something to carry around with you, and if you‚Äôre not as big on cream blushes like I am, then this is pretty much perfect for its purpose. It‚Äôll also be good for busy Moms ‚Äì Just dab on cheeks, tap a little to blend the edges, and you‚Äôre good to go, with a lovely glowing visage üòÄ IN A NUTSHELL The Clarins Skin Illusion Blush and Daily Energizing Lovely Lip Balm are both limited edition items available while stocks last. The lip balm is clear but adjusts to your skin pH to impart a tint of colour. It isn‚Äôt exactly a tinted lip balm, but there is a hint of colour. On me, it is a light peach that just keeps from washing me out. There is however, a strong peachy scent that doesn‚Äôt sit well with me, so it‚Äôll be best for those who don‚Äôt mind fruit scented lip products. I do however, like the Skin Illusion Blush, despite the gimmicky packaging. The sponge stamp is soft with a nice bounce, and picks up colour well from the pan, and transfers it to your skin easily. You do need to blend out the edges, and I found that the colour deepens a little on my skin, so less is more. The colour Luminous Pink is more of a warm pink with slightly peachy undertones, that is flattering, and refreshing. I think it‚Äôs cute and portable and something I‚Äôd use if I were on the go or travelling, or in a gym bag. It‚Äôs perfect that way. PROS: Affordable, Cute packaging, Flattering colours that will suit most skin tones except the very deep skin tones, Lip balm is very moisturising without feeling oily or greasy or sticky, Lip balm imparts a nice shine and a tint of colour, Blush is long lasting CONS: Lip balm has a strong peach scent that I don‚Äôt like, Limited Edition products WHO WILL LIKE THESE: Anyone who likes tinted lip balm, Anyone who prefers natural tints of lip colour while needing moisture for lips, Anyone who wants a portable powder blush PRICE: Daily Energizing Lovely Lip Balm ‚Äì RM79 | ¬£16 | US$20; Skin Illusion Blush ‚Äì RM85 | ¬£16 | US$21.50 WHERE TO BUY: Clarins counters and website (MY) website (US), Sephora stores, Nordstrom , Saks Fifth Avenue C‚Äôest moi with the Clarins Skin Illusion Blush in 01 Luminous Pink on cheeks and the Daily Energizing Lovely Lip Balm on lips. I like the rather natural look (once I toned down the blush somewhat) and it was surprisingly long lasting, except the lip balm of course ‚Äì it‚Äôs not meant to last. If you‚Äôre interested in what else I have on, from memory, the base is Bobbi Brown Skin Nourishing Glow foundation (AMAZING STUFF and only available in Asia Pacific, lucky us!) with Nars Radiant Creamy Concealer (onto my 3rd tube!), topped with Hourglass Ambient Lighting Powder (hit pan! Ok, I‚Äôm done with the superlatives LOL). On brows I‚Äôm testing the Bobbi Brown Long Wear Brow Gel, On eyes is Make Up For Ever eyeshadow and lined with Pixi eyeliner in black (my new fave!) but you can‚Äôt really see it anyway here so there‚Äôs no point my telling you about it LOL! üòÄ Do these Clarins makeup pieces catch your eye? Have you used Clarins makeup before? I like that they‚Äôre priced below RM100 each. For the blush, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs good value. For the lip balm, it might be considered a little pricey especially if you‚Äôre uncertain about scent. So I‚Äôd say get the blush. It‚Äôs cute, it‚Äôs easy to use, the colour is wearable and it‚Äôs portable and handy üôÇ Have you used any Clarins makeup?

not sure if it‚Äôs just me being a little jaded, or if cosmetics brands are starting to spread themselves a little thin on quality when they release limited edition or seasonal collections. More so when the colours on offer don‚Äôt interest nor excite me very much. I skipped most of the Summer collections this time around because Summer isn‚Äôt my thing, and because I found a lot of them boring *gasp* I said the B-word! With a summer collection created in collaboration with fashion designer Christopher Kane, Nars Cosmetics has released a limited edition range of makeup with what they call ‚ÄúNeoneutral‚Äù ‚Äì Neon colours that are oxymoronically neutral to wear. In some ways, it made sense. I‚Äôd have passed on this collection, if I‚Äôm to be honest. There was nothing in there that grabbed my attention. However, I was gifted with a couple of pieces from the collection and much to my surprise, my goodie bag contained Silent Nude blush instead of Starscape (hot pink!) which most other people received. I don‚Äôt deny I was a little taken aback but I felt I should therefore share my thoughts on it. If it had been Starscape, then it‚Äôd be just more of the same-old-same-old for you right? üòÄ Silent Nude, as you can see in the picture above, is a straight neutral blush. So neutral and so beige, I wasn‚Äôt sure what I should do with it LOL! Now pink, that‚Äôs easy, right? We could all do with a pink blush; but beige? Erm‚Ä¶. Incidentally also, the blushes in the Neoneutral collection represent a new formula. Thinner, sheerer and matte. Well, if you‚Äôre wondering how I did with Silent Nude, check out what I think, and if you have an idea on how to wear beige blushes ‚Äì SHARE! üòÄ Well, let‚Äôs just say that I struggled a little with what to do with Silent Nude. I‚Äôm not into shading and contouring and I felt that what Silent Nude would work best as, would be as a very light contour shade for the fair-skinned. Silent Nude Blush (RM128) In pan, the powder is a rather bland peachy-beige. On skin, when you build it up somewhat, it takes on a slightly warm peachy tone. If you wanted to wear a blush without looking like you were flushed, then this might be one you would want to look at to try. It adds a touch of barely perceptible warmth to the skin. The problem however, is that I am fair-skinned (I wear Mont Blanc ‚Äì Light 2 in Nars foundations) and even I had to layer this blush on to get it to show up on my skin. I used the Nars Bronzer Brush (I really like this brush!) to shade the sides of my face, and it added a bit of depth and warmth. Just to give you an idea of how Silent Nude looks when I wear it, here‚Äôs a picture. I am aware that I should and could have piled on more colour to get it to show up better, but I tried, and I had to walk out of the house after this, so I couldn‚Äôt risk putting on too much makeup. In person, it‚Äôs a bit more noticeable. On left, I only have Silent Nude on, which I applied along the sides of my face and cheeks. You MAY (I highlight the word ‚Äòmay‚Äô) notice the slight, warm shadow. On right, I‚Äôve topped up with a pink blush on the tops of my cheekbones. I feel the pink makes me look more alive, but the beige operates as a bit of a contour/warm base. If you are fair-skinned and have always wanted to play with bronzers and contour powders, but don‚Äôt want to deal with the brown and orange powders in the market, then Silent Nude might be what you‚Äôre looking for. Personally, I‚Äôm not into that so this isn‚Äôt a colour I‚Äôd use often. However, I also tried using it on my eyelids and I think I prefer that better. It makes a very good ‚Äúnude‚Äù eyeshadow base and blending colour and because it‚Äôs huge, it‚Äôll last forever ‚Äì yay! üòõ As for the texture, I found it a little dry and sheer. Sheer is good, if you were eyeing Starscape, the hot pink number. That one gives your cheeks a lovely, fresh, youthful pop of colour. If you wanted one item from the Christopher Kane collection, I‚Äôd suggest Starscape blush. The other item I‚Äôm wearing in my FOTD is Mezmer lipgloss (RM95) . Bright pink in the tube, but it goes on fairly sheer but pigmented. I don‚Äôt know if that statement even makes sense LOL! What I mean is that you get colour on your lips, but it‚Äôs not the neon pink you see in the tube. It‚Äôs a very lovely, bright but very wearable pink on lips. This one‚Äôs worth considering too, if lipgloss is your thing. It‚Äôs not sticky and very flattering. One more item from the collection is the Violet Atom Illuminating Multiple (RM154) . An iridescent pale violet in the tube, this swatches a transparent duo-chrome shimmer, rather like the rainbow at the top of an oil slick. This therefore functions best as a highlighter. I was shown at the new NARS boutique at MidValley Megamall, that one of the best ways to wear Violet Atom is to use your finger to dab at it, before applying to the top of your cheekbones, or under your brow. Anywhere you‚Äôd want to highlight. Again, this isn‚Äôt something I‚Äôd personally use a lot of, and is, I feel more suited to someone who is already into highlighters or who are already comfortable using makeup, or even makeup artists. Regular folk may find it a bit too finicky. Here are the swatches of the 3 products I have. Violet Atom, as you can see, is pure shine (no glitter, just shine) while Silent Nude I had to build up with a few layers to show you the colour. It‚Äôs a very natural, neutral sort of blush which I don‚Äôt use a lot of, but might appeal to someone who doesn‚Äôt like to wear pink or peach or coral or to look like they‚Äôre wearing blush but want to have some definition on cheeks. Mezmer, swatched directly from the tube, is pigmented, but sheer as you can tell. It‚Äôs glossy without being shimmery and isn‚Äôt sticky which is always a good thing! I wish I could be more excited about this collection, but the truth is that I was underwhelmed. I felt the eyeshadows ( Parallel Universe RM128 and Outer Limits RM98 ) were just too shimmery for daily wear. I am now of that age where I feel that too much shimmer around the eyes just age you further. If you are a sweet young thing, I‚Äôd say GO FOR IT! Wear all the shimmer you want and can, my young friend, because there will come a day when you feel that shimmer isn‚Äôt your friend anymore. I‚Äôve reached that day üôÅ That said, I was told that the shadows were sold out quite quickly so I‚Äôm clearly in the minority! üòÄ Starscape blush, while giving a pretty pop of colour, feels a bit too dry for my liking. What this means is that the colour is a bit sheerer than usual so it‚Äôs not so easy to overdo. The lipglosses are however, worth taking a look at because they are pretty and bright yet very wearable. Oh and if pink packaging is your crack, then the limited edition metallic pink NARS x Christopher Kane print might just tip you over the edge. But otherwise, you might just hold off till the next one and hope it‚Äôs more universally appealing. Did you pick up anything from the Nars x Christopher Kane Neoneutral collection? Do you wear beige blush? I welcome all ideas on how I can wear the beige Silent Nude blush. I‚Äôve tried piling it on, but it just didn‚Äôt really show up, and when it did, wasn‚Äôt very flattering on me, maybe because I don‚Äôt wear warm colours well. I still needed to top up with a touch of pink, to look better. I do wear it quite a lot as eyeshadow instead.

Anything deepfried is ‚Äì I dare you to disagree! Many of you may be familiar with my wee obsession with Guerlain‚Äôs Meteorites Perles. I have been collecting (and using) the last few limited edition ones that came out at Christmas. This year, I was looking forward to picking up the Champs Elysees Christmas balls when I saw the packaging and fell over myself running in the opposite direction. No matter my prejudices, ugly packaging turns me off, even if the contents appeal to me (Yes I find the Crazy Perles tin ugly ‚Äì sue me). Fortunately also, I thought the Crazy Meteorites Perles looked rather like the Dragon pearls from last year so I‚Äôm safe! Anyway, I declared that Guerlain‚Äôs Christmas offering was persona non grata for me. But when I went shopping for a friend, I *ahem* did cave for a couple of other items that I‚Äôd initially overlooked. Oops! On the bright side, no other Christmas collection appealed to me, so wallet is now safe. On the even brighter side, I picked up a couple of items that I‚Äôd been eyeing for the longest time ever but was previously reluctant to shell out for. The collection is only just available in stores here in Malaysia. I can show you pictures but no swatches nor full reviews because I need time to test it out and it‚Äôs not going to happen in the next week or so. Yet, I didn‚Äôt want you to miss out in case you were really eyeing something. So, here are pictures, quick thoughts and where to get them üôÇ Here are the items I chose from the Crazy Paris collection. On a side note, the name cracks me up. As a friend put it, I‚Äôm a little zany but not yet crazy. I hope. Although after this, I do feel a wee bit crazy LOL! I love Rouge G lipsticks . The ones in a case so heavy you can use it as a weapon, yet delicate enough that a mirror pops up for quick and easy touch ups. The limited edition offering comes in a black case, a departure from the silver cases, and a neon pink touch where the logo is. The shade I picked is 863 Provocative (RM161) , a bright pink. I wasn‚Äôt able to swatch it just yet so look around online for swatches. It‚Äôs a beautiful face brightening colour and the Rouge G formula is unbeatable. The second item I picked up is the Crazy Paris Pressed Meteorites powder (RM224) . This one is the pressed version of the famed Meteorites perles and the colour scheme reminds me of Mythic in the Meteorites Voyage, which I‚Äôve wanted to own for the longest time. The problem is that the Voyage Meteorites is double the price of this powder! It is different from Mythic though. This has more pink in it although I believe it applies translucent. The purpose of this is as a finishing powder. These magic powders give you a diffused, luminous look similar to what you can get from the pearls, but in a compact, travel friendly form. I believe the pan can be popped out and refilled with the Mythic refills too so that‚Äôs a bonus! I‚Äôm really pleased with this because it‚Äôs one of those things that I‚Äôve wanted for the longest time, and to be able to get it for just about half the price (even if it is still very expensive) makes me happy. The final item I picked up surprised me because it isn‚Äôt something I‚Äôd usually look at. I picked up the Crazy Paris Terracotta Healthy Glow powder (RM224) which is essentially a bronzer. Now you see, I don‚Äôt usually buy or use bronzers. No matter how I try, I always look like I have dirt smudged on my face. But I was picking it up for a friend and I was curious. I dug around and Temptalia had me intrigued. You see, despite looking rather dark and brown in the pan, apparently, this Terracotta powder applies more like a peachy blush. BLUSH! Hello blush! üòÄ I wanted to swatch this at the counter, but the testers weren‚Äôt there yet so I eventually decided to take a chance on this. I‚Äôm wearing it today and the reviews are accurate. This Crazy Paris Terracotta bronzer is pretty much a peachy blush on skin and looks very lovely on! The brown bits aren‚Äôt very dark and I expect if you want to use it as a bronzer, just be sure to avoid the pink bits and you‚Äôll have your bronzer. Otherwise, swirl your brush all over and use it as a blush as I do. Both the pressed Meteorites and the Terracotta powder come in the same compact packaging. The 68 Champs Elysees address on the case commemorates the Guerlain flagship boutique in Paris. It looks like plastic, but is very solid in construction and has a good heft to it. Not the light plastic you usually get with these sort of compacts and definitely symbolic of the luxury I‚Äôve come to expect from the brand. I‚Äôm happy with what I got. They‚Äôre items that I‚Äôve been wanting to own and something that I took a chance on that worked out well üôÇ Here‚Äôs a poorly lit shot of the Crazy Paris Neon Look eye palette (RM258) that I took using my mobile at the counter, just to show you what it looks like. The colours don‚Äôt appeal to me so I‚Äôm not in any way tempted. The packaging is similar to the Liu Eye and Lip calligraphy palette from last year which I love and still use often. So these are just my quick thoughts after picking up the items yesterday. Here‚Äôs where you can check them out and buy them if you want (and my recommended SAs) Parkson KLCC ‚Äì I got mine here. Look for Ishak, the male SA who is lovely and helpful and friendly. I think Parkson KLCC is doing some promotion (there‚Äôs a pop up booth outside) so you‚Äôll get lots of GWPs including a set of brushes. Also ask for samples of anything you want to try. Isetan KLCC ‚Äì The SA to look for will be Irene, also friendly and helpful. She told me Isetan will get stock in after 9th November so you can check with her then. I would in normal circumstances get my items from Isetan because of the points I can collect, but this time I had to get it early. There are other items in the collection and various perfume gift sets that I didn‚Äôt have a chance to check out but if you do, I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts on them üôÇ I‚Äôll have full reviews up in a couple of weeks (hopefully) so let me know which you want to see first! So, are you planning to get anything from the Guerlain Crazy Paris collection? Or what did you end up getting? I wasn‚Äôt expecting to get anything but it was all too good for me to pass up. Love them all and if you‚Äôre asking for a rec, I highly recommend the Terracotta Healthy Glow powder especially for anyone who is afraid of bronzer like I am. On light skintones, it‚Äôs a lovely blush. On deeper skintones, it will act more like a contour or highlight but it‚Äôs sublime either way üòÄ If you do end up getting anything, I‚Äôd love to know what you got! üòÄ Paris B Guerlain Crazy Paris Collection prices are as set out above. Available at Guerlain counters ‚Äì Isetan and Parkson KLCC, Sogo, Isetan The Gardens and Parkson Pavilion.

Me, that‚Äôs who! LOL We‚Äôre in Fall/Winter mode in the cosmetics world, and here we have, a product released by NARS as part of their Spring 2015 collection. But what the hey, it‚Äôs a permanent product, so you can still buy it if you like. Besides, friends in the Southern hemisphere are just coming on Spring‚Ä¶ so I‚Äôm still on trend‚Ä¶ somewhere in the world! LOL! The Nars Dual Intensity Blush is a blush counterpart to the dual intensity formula of eyeshadows they released to high acclaim some time last year. I‚Äôd never used any of them. Thought about getting the eyeshadow palette for a while but eventually passed. Each blush comes in a set of 2 shades that allows you to blend as you like. But what makes this formula somewhat unique, is that Nars made it so it can be used wet or dry, and you get two different intensities of pigment and colour this way. Hence the name. But to use a blush wet? Gosh‚Ä¶. I can‚Äôt imagine it, can you? While I understand the concept of using eyeshadow wet for stronger intensity of colour, I couldn‚Äôt get my head around using a blush wet. When I asked a Nars makeup artist how that would work, she explained it thus:- Dampen your blush brush by spritzing some water on it. Brush the damp (not wet please!) brush over the product. Apply to skin and blend out Depending on the colour you pick, and how much product you pick up, the effect will either be a) more intense colour payoff or b) a more transparent ‚Äúwatercolour‚Äù effect. Demonstrated on the back of my hand, it looked intriguing albeit splotchy. Attempted at home, it‚Äôs a mess. So, let‚Äôs just say that unless you‚Äôre the adventurous sort, just stick to using this dry , because it serves up pretty good pigment anyway, and you don‚Äôt have to faff about with damp brushes and what-not. In fact, I think it‚Äôs far more flattering when used dry because of the softer, more luminous effect, rather than the splotches of colour you get when using it wet. The 2 shades I was gifted with, are a study in contrasts. Panic which is pictured in the foreground, is a bright pink on one side, and a warm red on the other. This one is a straight blush, and fairly pigmented. For those with fair skintones, you need a soft, fluffy blush brush and a light hand or I swear, you will find it is too much. But for those with a deeper skintone, I think this will be perfect, because it will give your skin just that right amount of blush-flush. Jubilation , in the background, is a warm gold on one side, and a nude-peach on the other. This one I use strictly as a highlighter. While not highly shimmery when I use a soft fluffy brush, you can amp up the highlighting effect by using a denser brush. Here are the swatches on my arm, dry ‚Äì I‚Äôm a Nars Foundation in Light 2 Mont Blanc for reference, and these swatches were done with my fingers. Pretty intense, and I hardly even scratched the surface of the blushes! The product feels hard, but the colour comes off quite easily onto brushes and fingers. It does remind me of a cake of watercolour you know üòõ I don‚Äôt wear Jubilation a lot, because I‚Äôm not really into the whole highlighting thing. But it is fairly subtle and not very shimmery or glittery at all, which makes it actually quite wearable. As for Panic , I tend to wear the pink side most of the time, because the warm red side doesn‚Äôt flatter my skintone as much, and in fact, makes my skin look blotchy. If you have a pigmentation problem like I do, then colours like these will emphasize your pigmentation and make it look worse than it is. Sometimes, I blend the shades, but the colour does turn out a little deeper than I like. For an idea of how these blushes look on my skin, here‚Äôs how I usually wear it. In these shots, I wore just the pink side of Panic, applied with a light hand using my Lunasol Cheek Brush , which is soft and fluffy enough, and rigorously blended out to soften. I also applied some of the Jubilation on the cheekbones for a touch of highlight. Nothing too noticeable. Some days, I get it right, and it comes out looking soft and flushed. Other days, I get it wrong and I look like someone slapped me, or worse, I look like I didn‚Äôt know how to apply blush, with 2 splotches of colour on my cheeks. So, if you‚Äôre wondering if I like these, I‚Äôll have to say that I‚Äôm on the fence. On the one hand, I like the intensity of colour, and easy blendability of the product. You can buff and buff, and the colour doesn‚Äôt disappear, but looks much more natural. On the other hand, I feel that it‚Äôs a bit too much work, especially if you aren‚Äôt as dab a hand at using blush or makeup, or if you don‚Äôt own a soft fluffy blush brush. As for using it wet, I honestly wouldn‚Äôt bother. IN A NUTSHELL The Nars Dual Intensity Blushes come in a compact with 2 shades that you can use alone or blend. They are formulated to be used both wet and dry, although I find it a little too weird to use a blush with a wet brush. Errors abound, and it goes on splotchy. I find the colours fairly intense when dry, so there‚Äôs no real need to use them wet. As they are fairly pigmented, I‚Äôd suggest using a fluffy brush and a light hand to apply, and build up colour as you need. Also, gently buffing it into your skin gives a nice luminous flush, as the product isn‚Äôt very shimmery, yet gives a nice glow. Longevity is good for my normal-dry skin, lasting pretty much all day. I think these are particularly good for those with a deeper skintone, as the colours are quite intense and pigmented. For the very fair, be gentle. I‚Äôm not in love with either of the shades featured nor any of the shades in the collection as I feel they swing too wildly in the extremes of shade, tone and intensity. The packaging appears to be improved from the regular rubberized NARS packaging but it remains to be seen if it‚Äôll degrade and turn sticky after a while. I can‚Äôt quite tell. PROS: Pigmented and intense colours, Not powdery, Packaging is sturdy and compact, 2 colours in each compact makes it versatile to use CONS: The concept of using it wet is just too weird, Due to the intensity of pigment and colour it is easy to overdo, Pricey WHO WILL LIKE THIS: Anyone who is familiar with and comfortable using blush, Anyone who wants more intense and pigmented blush shades especially if you have deeper skintones The new packaging does deserve mention though. I find that they feel less rubbery, and are more sturdy and feel less fragile. I don‚Äôt know if it will degrade as time goes on, so I‚Äôll update if it does. It does attract dust and dirt so if you‚Äôre anal about keeping your products clean, avoid at all costs. You will go mad trying to keep it clean üòõ Did you try these Nars Dual Intensity blushes, or were you intrigued by them? If you tried them, which colour was your favourite? While I like the luminous effect I get from these blushes, the shades I feel, can be improved on. For now, they are just too much of a contrast, or just too bold. Above all, be sure to equip yourself with a soft blush brush and blend, blend, blend! üôÇ Paris B NARS Dual Intensity Blushes come in 6 shades ‚Äì Panic, Jubilation (pictured here), Fervour, Frenzy, Craving and Adoration Price: RM191 | US$45 Availability: NARS counters and stores online (USA), Sephora (USA)</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Author</name><value><array><data><value><string>Paris B</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>2015-11-06 08:30:41</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>c7de-44fb-8840</string></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>a91229367f91825be4e9f314e61fe6617ad19b61</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Author</name><value><array><data><value><string>Paris B</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>http://www.mywomenstuff.com/2010/02/skinz-infinite-eye-revive-therapy-eye-cream-with-uv-protection/</string></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>Skinz Infinite Eye Revive Therapy ‚Äì Eye cream with UV Protection</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>2010-02-26 13:00:22</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>c7de-44fb-8840</string></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>62cee66ef1360c665d8d7ec58e49e0bcefe252c5</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>Small but Mighty, the Guerlain M√©t√©orites Perles de Blush add an Angelic Radiance to skin</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>http://www.mywomenstuff.com/2015/02/guerlain-meteorites-perles-de-blush-angelic-radiance/</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>I‚Äôve gone a little Guerlain crazy on Instagram lately, but it‚Äôs mostly because of a) cabin fever (I haven‚Äôt been out to a mall in ages!) and b) new pretty things from my favourite brand! üòÄ There are a few items in Guerlain‚Äôs Les Tendres Spring 2015 collection but to be honest, I wasn‚Äôt taken by anything else in the collection except one ‚Äì the M√©t√©orites Perles de Blush Eclat Angelique . There are some pretty looking eyeshadow palettes and some coral lipsticks but I wasn‚Äôt interested. I was there at the Guerlain counter for one thing and one thing only ‚Äì my blush balls! üòÄ There are some misconceptions I should clear up before I tell you what I think though. While these are part of the Guerlain M√©t√©orites franchise, it is a blush. It isn‚Äôt meant to be anything else except a blush so please do not try to use this as an all over powder the way I‚Äôve actually seen some people mention. Of course it will make you look silly ‚Äì try applying any blush all over your face and see how silly you look! üòõ Secondly, please do not be fooled by the enormous close up pictures you‚Äôre seeing everyday on Instagram and online. The product is tiny. Not merely tiny, it‚Äôs teeny tiny. I will show you some basis for comparison in the following pictures but be aware of what you‚Äôre getting and don‚Äôt pan the product just because you thought you were getting a larger product. Remember, images seen online always appear larger (and better) than in real life. It‚Äôs called photo editing and perspective. So, you know I love love love my Guerlain M√©t√©orites and you know that I love love love blush. It‚Äôs something I‚Äôm sort of known for, so naturally, the minute I knew it was available at counters, I was off like a shot to pick one up for my very own üòÄ Here‚Äôs another complaint about the M√©t√©orites Perles de Blush ‚Äì it comes in cardboard packaging. I‚Äôm not going to defend that because I, like everyone plundering their savings for this little limited edition gem, would have preferred something better that would potentially last longer. Yet, from my experience with the plastic tubs we get now as compared to the cardboard tubs we used to get before (I gave mine to my sister) I find that the plastic tubs end up with more powder residue than when I had the cardboard tubs. Is it because plastic is harder and therefore when the powder pearls move around in transit they break up more? Is it because cardboard is more forgiving to impact? I don‚Äôt know and I won‚Äôt speculate. Guerlain picking cardboard, with the vintage design embossed on it seems to imply a throwback to a more classic, vintage period. Also, it is because they know they can get away with it LOL! üòÄ See, suckers like me still buy it! üòÄ I‚Äôve also read comments by people saying that the box is flimsy or that it will crush easily to which my reply is ‚Äì what on earth are people doing with their makeup?! This isn‚Äôt a product you will travel with (It‚Äôs too messy to) and unless you have Hulk-like strength, just be a little more careful with your belongings and you‚Äôll be fine. Again, Guerlain isn‚Äôt going to care about what we think because this was a one off release and they knew full well they‚Äôd get away with it despite all the complaints üòõ There is a puff that keeps the balls in place in transit, but it does pick up product so don‚Äôt use it to apply the product because you will end up using too much. The colour is pretty pigmented despite its diminutive size and packs a punch. So, use a light hand and build up colour as you go along. Oh and the pearls in this one are tiny. They reminded me of sherbet candy that I used to eat as a kid, that snaps, crackles and pops in the mouth. It is so tiny, I‚Äôm afraid to hold it and sneeze because it will end up all over the floor, or I might accidentally inhale it. It is miniscule! Keep it away from children and pets. Besides being a potential choking hazard, your wallet will weep an ocean of tears. I‚Äôm showing you a comparison between the regular sized M√©t√©orites and the ones from the Perles de Blush. The 3 that are smaller are from the blush. It‚Äôs like those little pearls you get on cupcakes. Can I forgive them the size and reduced quantity? (the Perles de Blush are a mere 13g vs 25g in the regular sized M√©t√©orites powders) Actually, no I can‚Äôt. I can understand the smaller sizes ‚Äì it allows for your brush to pick up a more uniform shade which is useful because the product is so pigmented. Yet, I would have appreciated more product for the price we‚Äôre paying. Again however, Guerlain knew they‚Äôd get away with it ‚Äì the proof is in the way it flies off the shelves with everyone cooing ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so cute!!‚Äù üòõ This is what happens when I dip a blush brush into the tub. You may notice how my brush picks up quite a lot of product, and the colour you see is about what you‚Äôd get on your skin ‚Äì a warmed rose-red-pink flush, with some shimmer. I don‚Äôt find it very shimmery. In fact, I find that it has a very transparent colour that offers a glow as opposed to outright shimmer, and that is very flattering when worn by anyone of any skintone. Just layer it on for your preferred colour depth. My advise is to just tap on the surface of the product. Don‚Äôt go jabbing your brush in and swirling it around. You‚Äôll lose all the product and end up with too much colour. Be gentle. Tame that Hulk-like strength üòõ Here is an approximation of how it looks when I wear it. I had to use the phone camera so please excuse the lower quality pictures, but it gave me what I needed. You may notice the pinkish glow I get on the cheeks. This is with just 1-2 layers of colour. It‚Äôs very natural, transparent and flattering. It also lasts all day for me. I love the Perles de Blush. It looks lovely when worn and it fits prettily into my M√©t√©orites collection. It however, isn‚Äôt a rational purchase. Do bear in mind that I‚Äôm a Guerlain M√©t√©orites collector and a blush fiend ‚Äì that makes me irrational in my choices. For everyone else who are on the fence and wondering if this is worth buying or if it‚Äôs mere hype, ask yourself these questions:- Do you love blush? Can you spare RM192/ US$53? Do you understand the siren song of the M√©t√©orites powders/pearls? If you answered ‚ÄúYes‚Äù to any or all of the above, then buy the Perles de Blush ‚Äì you will not regret it. But if you didn‚Äôt, skip it. You won‚Äôt miss it. IN A NUTSHELL The M√©t√©orites Perles de Blush Angelic Radiance is part of the Les Tendres Spring 2015 collection from Guerlain. It is a loose powder blush in a very small cardboard tub. However, the product is lovely when worn on skin as it is well pigmented, and yet disperses a very transparent flush on skin. The colour can be easily built up for most skin tones, and while there is shimmer, it isn‚Äôt very shimmery. For me, it offers a glow to the skin as opposed to outright shimmer. I would advise using a light hand due to the intensity of colour. This isn‚Äôt a must have, nothing is. But if you love blush and M√©t√©orites and have money to spare, it is very nice to have. PROS: Lovely flush of colour when applied on skin, Gives skin a natural transparent glow, Pigmented product, Suitable for most skin tones, Completes the M√©t√©orites collection for collectors CONS: Pricey, Little product, Cardboard box WHO WILL LIKE THIS: Anyone who loves blush, Guerlain M√©t√©orites powders and have money to spare because it‚Äôs expensive LIMITED EDITION: Yes, Guerlain Les Tendres Spring 2015 One more shot showing you the size of the tub and the blush balls held in the palm of my hand. I don‚Äôt have a very large hand, so you might have an idea of what I mean when I say it‚Äôs tiny. But I‚Äôd say this is a tiny product that packs quite a pretty punch! So naturally no, I don‚Äôt regret my purchase one bit. Remember, I‚Äôm irrational üòÄ Did you pick up the M√©t√©orites Perles de Blush? Are you tempted to and if you did, do you love it or are you disappointed? This was the one item I‚Äôd waited for for Spring 2015 and it‚Äôs my first purchase to date of any makeup in 2015! I‚Äôm very happy about that, and the fact that it‚Äôs a) blush and b) M√©t√©orites.

Every collection seemed to look the same and as is wont at this festive time of year, every collection gets that bling factor that can sometimes be far too much for daily wear. I was all ready to shut my wallet and call it a day till Fall/Autumn 2014 when my eye fell on Guerlain. And just like that, I tumbled head over heels for 3 items in the Guerlain Crazy Paris collection . Damn you Guerlain, you just know how to grab me! I‚Äôd shown you the photos of the items when I picked them up so this is mostly just my thoughts on the items I bought, why I love them so, and why I think they are worth considering if your budget allows it to be stretched that far. The primary item I planned to pick up was the Crazy Meteorites Radiance Power . You see, as much as I love the Meteorites loose perles, they are a right bitch to travel with. The packaging is bulky, the balls will disappear and it creates a right royal mess if they open up in your travel pouch. So, I‚Äôve been lusting after the pressed version for the longest time. However, the Meteorites Voyage weigh in at a staggering RM400+ and that‚Äôs just mind-boggling. I may be mad, but I have my limits and I will not pay over RM400 for a face powder. When I saw the Crazy Meteorites Radiance Powder, I thought that like the Wulong powder from last year, it too would stagger me at prices over RM400. So, imagine my surprise when it wasn‚Äôt! Guerlain Crazy Meteorites Radiance Powder ‚Äì RM224 Sure, at RM224, it‚Äôs not exactly loose change either. It‚Äôs still very expensive and yeah, I have to be crazy to spend that much money on a powder. But hey, if I didn‚Äôt get it now, I‚Äôd never be able to buy it! And after 2 weeks of using it, I‚Äôm so happy I got it üòÄ The powder reminds me of Mythic, the radiant finishing powder, but with more significant pink tones. Don‚Äôt layer on too much if you don‚Äôt want to have the pink tones show up on skin. I use a large fluffy brush, swirl it all over the powder and the apply it all over my face, to finish off my look, as it were. The effect is amazing. You can‚Äôt see anything, it‚Äôs a translucent powder after all, but it is almost as if you have taken a blur tool to your face in real life. It just makes my skin look better and natural. Pores and lines appear softened, skin looks smoother and brightened, it‚Äôs like photoshop in a compact. Love! As you can see, my compact is already showing wear which surprised me a little. But I‚Äôm not too fussed because the compact will fit the refill pans of the Meteorites Voyage which come in under RM200 so I‚Äôll be able to refill it as I go, and I plan to. If you don‚Äôt intend to pick anything up from any makeup collection this year, pause for a moment to consider the Guerlain Crazy Meteorites Radiance Powder. I have never been happier with a piece of makeup! Guerlain Crazy Terracotta Healthy Glow Powder ‚Äì RM224 This one was an impulsive purchase that I‚Äôm also very happy with. I‚Äôve read so much about how wonderful Guerlain Terracotta bronzers are but all shades, including the light ones look muddy on me. I don‚Äôt wear bronzers well. But when I was about to pass on the Crazy Terracotta Healthy Glow Powder, I paused for a moment. It‚Äôs unusual to see a bronzer in a winter collection but it certainly caught my eye. It looks quite dark in the pan, but all reviews pointed to it applying very sheer with a peach toned flush on skin. When I saw it in person, I had my misgivings. It‚Äôs so dark! But I bit the bullet anyway and I have never regretted it. This is a beautiful blush! On fair-medium skintones, it shows up as a peachy flush which serves well as a blush. It makes skin look healthier and perkier with just the right amount of colour on skin without looking muddy or dirty. The texture is very transparent so you get that glow from within, and you can use any brush to apply it. I use a regular blush brush and it applies beautifully. You only need a little to give cheeks that beautiful flush of colour. I‚Äôve been using it a lot as well since I got it, and it‚Äôs barely showing any wear at all! The texture in pan is quite hard, and even when you try to swatch it, it‚Äôs very hard and doesn‚Äôt give off a lot of colour. The secret therefore is in using a brush. Any brush and the colour is picked up and deposited on skin with the right amount of glow without glitter. There is the signature scent of violets but I forgive them because it doesn‚Äôt last and the product performs so well anyway. Oh and longevity is crazy! It lasts all day, looking perfect from morning to evening! I sometimes like to top up a little pink blush on the apples of the cheeks, but only when I want an extra flush of colour. Most of the time, I wear it on its own because it‚Äôs just so perfect. I never thought I‚Äôd ever wax lyrical about a bronzer, but here you go. This is the best thing I‚Äôve ever used. Ever! Guerlain Rouge G ‚Äì Provocative 863 RM161 This is the bright fuchsia lipstick that you see in the picture and some better pictures of it brand new here . This is the Rouge G formula which is creamy, pigmented and super long lasting. They are among my favourite lipstick formulas simply because they are creamy and long lasting without being drying on lips. The limited edition Provocative 863 is a bright fuchsia that reminded me at first glance of Madame Batifole but turns out more pink. Instead of the regular shiny metal case, we get a black metal case with a neon pink logo. I seem to find the violet scent a little stronger in Provocative than I‚Äôm used to. But again, it dissipates and I forgive it because it‚Äôs such an amazing colour against any skin tone. Here are some swatches because you have no idea what I‚Äôm on about without seeing them in action right? üòõ Swatches! Left: Guerlain Rouge G Provocative Right: Crazy Terracotta Healthy Glow Powder Provocative was swatched just one. Don‚Äôt you just LOVE how intense it is?! üòÄ I had to rub hard at the surface of the powder to get Crazy Terracotta to show up but this gives you an idea of what it looks like if it were applied heavily. Despite the deep brown, bronzed shades in the pan, the product shows up as a peachy flush on skin, which is what sold me onto the idea of getting it in the first place. And here‚Äôs an idea of how the products look when worn. In the picture, I‚Äôm wearing the Crazy Meteorites applied all over, Crazy Terracotta on cheeks and Provocative on lips. Eyes were a mixture of colours from the Urban Decay 15th Anniversary palette . You can‚Äôt actually see how the Meteorites look, but just trust me when I say that it acts like a diffuser so imperfections are blurred and diffused. The bronzer isn‚Äôt too dark, acting as a contour with a light hand, and as a blush on apples of the cheeks if you layer it on. The lip colour is pure gorgeousness. In a nutshell These 3 pieces of Guerlain‚Äôs Crazy Paris collection are to me, the best of the collection and quite underrated. This is a good time to pick up the pressed Meteorites because it‚Äôs more affordable than the regular Voyage version. Almost half the price! The compact is refillable. If you have been afraid of using a bronzer like I have then you will love the Crazy Terracotta powder which is essentially a light warmed peach flush on skin. The texture is hard to touch, but you only need a brush to lightly swipe across the surface and apply to skin for an instant healthy glow. They weren‚Äôt kidding! The lipstick will appeal to anyone who loves bright creamy long lasting lipsticks. All in all, I think these are winners and worth the splurge if funds allow. If you could just pick one, my suggestion is to pick either the Crazy Meteorites or the Crazy Terracotta depending on what you will use more of. I promise, you won‚Äôt regret it one bit. I haven‚Äôt üòÄ Pros: Everything I‚Äôve been raving on about above ‚Äì they‚Äôre just perfection! Cons: Pricey, Limited Edition, Violets scent in powder and lipstick are a little strong but dissipate Who will like this: Anyone who already loves the Meteorites perles, Anyone who doesn‚Äôt like bronzer but wants a light healthy glow on skin, Anyone who loves longlasting creamy bright coloured lipstick I realise these are pricey items so no, they aren‚Äôt must haves. If you are already in the market for something similar then these are there, at the top of the heap. Quality is excellent as I‚Äôve come to expect from Guerlain and the finishing of the product and the case is lovely and luxurious. Did you pick anything up from the Guerlain Crazy Paris collection? Are there other collections you‚Äôre eyeing? These were all I picked up. The rest of the collection was blah to me and I cannot get over my dislike for the Crazy Paris Champs Elysees tin of pearls LOL It‚Äôs the only tub of Meteorites I haven‚Äôt bought since I started collecting them! üòÄ Paris B Guerlain Crazy Paris collection.

There was a reason why this was so. Old movies and photographs were taken in black and white, and colour photography wasn‚Äôt as high definition then as it is now, so and strong, bold colours show off contrasts better. Then again, maybe people valued elegance and glamour more back in the day. There was a charm about old Hollywood that I think has been much eroded in modern times. Movie stars seemed more like stars ‚Äì glittery, golden, glamorous, elegant, untouchable. I think this is what Bobbi Brown envisaged in the Old Hollywood collection released for Christmas 2013. These are some of the items in the collection and I think you can already see how it all ties in with the festive season. The touches of elegant red on lips, the golden glitter infusing the eyes, nails and lips and an easy elegance in the sleek lines of the packaging. Performance of products aside, this is quite a visual feast for the eyes and fitting to its theme. You may already have seen this around or even picked up an item or two from the collection so let me know what you think of it while I run it down quickly for you. Get a coffee, we have lots to get through üôÇ The Old Hollywood Eye Palette (RM290) is quite easily the star of the collection, with it‚Äôs eye catching grid of 9 neutral toned eye colours in a slim, handy palette. This is one of those palettes that will catch the eye of those who love wearing neutral eyeshadow. Up to 5 years ago, I‚Äôd have given this a cursory glance and headed for a palette with brighter, more tropical colours. But in this past 5 years, I‚Äôve grown fond of neutral tones so this did catch my eye. I actually think this to be quite a balanced neutral palette in that the tones are quite equally cool and warm. So, someone with a cooler skintone like me will be able to wear these colours without them looking muddy on the eye area, as will someone with warmer skintone. It won‚Äôt look ashy. However, I will have to tell you also that not everyone will like this palette. The reason is because for the most part, people will find the colour pay off to be a little poor in most of the colours. It‚Äôs not unwearable, but it will take a little more work to pull off and with the many options out there *cough Naked2 cough* this does fall a little short. I‚Äôm quite used to working with sheerer colours for eyeshadow as that‚Äôs what I do gravitate towards, so I didn‚Äôt think too much of it. For the matte colours, you will need to layer for them to show up well. For the shimmer colours, barring one or two, most of them are mostly for highlighting. Use a good eye brush (not the one included please) and you‚Äôll appreciate it better. But use fingers and you‚Äôll just wrinkle your nose. These swatches of the Old Hollywood Eye Palette should give you an idea of the colours and texture. I‚Äôve swatched them from left to right, top row to bottom and I‚Äôll label and describe them below. Bobbi Brown Old Hollywood Eye Palette swatches Ivory ‚Äì a matte ivory shade for base or highlight. Swatches sheer. Golden Pink ‚Äì a metallic eyeshadow that is pigmented, but to me is more of a golden bronze than a golden pink. I don‚Äôt see any pink tones. This makes a nice accent colour and if you blend it out, takes on a foiled appearance that‚Äôs quite pretty. Gold ‚Äì a sparkle shadow that applies as a sheer sparkly gold, best used as a highlight or to add glam factor Opal ‚Äì Another spakle shadow that is also sheer and applies with a silvery tone. Also best used as a highlight or to add glam Fog ‚Äì A matte grey that feels hard to the touch and swatches sheer with fingers. I built up the colour by layering, so you can see what it looks like. Best applied with a dense eyeshadow brush in a patting motion and can be used to add definition and shadow. Beige ‚Äì A matte camel tan eyeshadow that has significant warm tones. Also swatches sheerly and buildable but not flattering on a cooler skintone like mine. This is the colour I use the least of. Chocolate Bronze ‚Äì A sparkle shadow that looks quite strong in pan but applies sheer as per Gold and Opal. Best used to accent and add sparkle over a base but not best worn on its own unless you layer it. Candlelight Gold ‚Äì A very pretty cool toned light gold that is pigmented and makes a very pretty lid colour. Eclipse ‚Äì a matte charcoal black that has a hard dry texture and takes some layering for it to show up All in all, I can‚Äôt say this palette is a must have, because I do think many people will be disappointed with the dry and sheer texture especially of the matte shadows. You can work with them of course, but you will need a good dense brush and patience. Also, it will depend on the sort of eye makeup that you do. I usually only do makeup for work and this does fit my lifestyle because it isn‚Äôt too intense and I can wear a colour like Candlelight Gold but lower the intensity by using a matte shade to blend it out, and a dark shade to add some shadow. Nothing too intense. But if you love your shadows strong, bold and pigmented, don‚Äôt get this one. You‚Äôll be disappointed. You know me and red lips and what‚Äôs an image of Old Hollywood without the signature red lips worn by screen sirens of old right? This is the Bobbi Brown Lip Color in Old Hollywood (RM98) , a bright warmed red in limited edition gold casing. You know what‚Äôs interesting? I just realised I‚Äôve never tried Bobbi Brown lipsticks! This would be my first. The colour in tube bright and I can imagine, intimidating to many. I personally find it a bit warm for my tastes, but it does harken back to red lipsticks I‚Äôve been used to seeing from the past. That sort of bright chilli red that really gives that POW! glam look. Left: Bobbi Brown Lip Color Old Hollywood Right: High Shimmer Lip Gloss Candlelight I think that swatch says it all right? üòÄ It‚Äôs bright, it‚Äôs bold and it‚Äôs Old Hollywood. Contrary to the eye palette, the lipstick applies creamy and pigmented and one layer is all you need for a lovely glamorous red lip. But if you want it to last longer, layer on another layer for even more intensity. I didn‚Äôt find it drying and longevity was fair enough. It didn‚Äôt travel either because the formula isn‚Äôt that creamy. Just creamy enough so it doesn‚Äôt tug on your lips. The colour isn‚Äôt matte but there is no shimmer so if you want to give it a more modern twist, then dab on some of the High Shimmer Lip Gloss in Candlelight (RM88) . It adds golden shine to the lips and makes it look very festive and plush. There are 4 colours in the range ‚Äì Candlelight (light pale gold), Rose (shimmer pink), Siren Red (red) and Old Hollywood (yellow gold) so if a layering gloss isn‚Äôt something you‚Äôre looking for then look to Rose or Siren Red instead. If glitter and shine on your face isn‚Äôt your thing then how about a touch of glitter for your nails instead? The Bobbi Brown Glitter Nail Polish in Chrome (RM65) is a bottle of multicoloured glitter that adds that touch of bling to your nails. I‚Äôm not into nail polish and if you‚Äôre not good at it, like me, always go for a shimmer/glitter polish. Mistakes don‚Äôt show up and the bling on your nails will blind anyone into thinking you have perfectly polished nails üòâ Pictured swatched just in one layer. Already you can see how festive your nails look! If you want more bling factor, apply 2 layers. Of all the items in the Old Hollywood range, I think this has the most fun factor and the most festive. Plus, in terms of nail polish, it‚Äôs also reasonably priced. Did I mention fun? üòÄ I do have one more item from the Old Hollywood collection that I want to show you but not today. It‚Äôs a personal favourite and I‚Äôll dedicate it its own post üòÄ In a nutshell If you ignore the overly photoshopped Katie Holmes that fronts the Bobbi Brown Old Hollywood collection, I think there are items to like in here. But as with all makeup, it will always depend on your style and preferences. The Old Hollywood Eye Palette is nice to me, and I can make it work but I think that for the majority who want something easier to work with, it isn‚Äôt ideal. The texture is a little hard and dry. It‚Äôs nice when you mix and match the textures but it‚Äôs one to check out in person. The Old Hollywood Lip Color will appeal to those who are bold enough to pull off a bright red lip and the texture is quite nice and creamy. It isn‚Äôt so creamy that it bleeds or feathers which is always a boon. I felt it was comfortable to wear even if the colour isn‚Äôt as flattering on me as I hoped it would. The High Shimmer Lip Gloss isn‚Äôt something I personally like because I‚Äôm not into layering gloss over lipstick but it does make a colour like Old Hollywood look more modern and also helps tone down the colour, even if it adds high shine. Pros: The eyeshadow palette is a nice portable neutral palette with a mix of matte and shimmer shades, The lipstick is creamy and pigmented, The nail polish is fun and easy to apply Cons: Many will find the eyeshadow palette sheer and pricey, The Old Hollywood lipstick will not sit well on those who have very cool tones in their skin Who will like this: Anyone who might be looking for a bright slightly warmed red lipstick, Anyone who loves sparkly glitter nail polish, Anyone already familiar with Bobbi Brown eyeshadow textures and who prefers a sheerer texture in eyeshadow Here‚Äôs how I wore the items I‚Äôve featured to give you an idea of how they look. The first picture is of the lip colour without lip gloss. In the second, I dabbed on some of the Candlelight lip gloss to add shine. On eyes I had the Old Hollywood Eye Palette with Fog and Eclipse to shade from the lashline and in the outer corner, Candlelight Gold as an all over lid shade and Ivory to blend and tie all the colours together. Add liner to define eyes and voila! üôÇ On cheeks, I had the Nude Glow shimmerbrick with a touch of Apricot blush, and pressed Meteorites all over . Did you take a look at the Bobbi Brown Old Hollywood collection? Does anything leap out at you (even if you aren‚Äôt looking to buy?) For me, the first thing to leap out at me was the eye palette, strangely enough. You‚Äôd have thought it would be the lipstick! I found the lipstick a bit old fashioned but damn! It channels Old Hollywood, alright! üòÄ Paris B Bobbi Brown Old Hollywood is a Limited Edition collection for Christmas 2013.

all my attempts at using a bronzer, and despite how user-friendly the Dior Nude Tan Aurora Bronzing Powder from Summer 2012 was, I‚Äôm still not your best example of a bronzing beauty. But pair the bronzer powder with a blush and my sights zero straight on to the product ‚Äì no blinking, do not pass Go, do not collect $200. This was the 1 item from the Dior Bird of Paradise Summer 2013 collection that I was most excited about ‚Äì the Dior Nude Tan Paradise Duo Blush and Bronzer duo . In Asia, we only get Pink Glow (001) while the collection boasts 2 shades ‚Äì Pink Glow 001 and Coral Glow 002. What the product is, is a 2 in one face colour with a bronzer on one side and a pink toned blush on the other. You can blend all the colours together when applying to skin, or just use each side separately. I‚Äôve pictured it here with the limited edition Dior Summer Brush, which is a fluffy face brush for light coverage, and has distinctive red bristles. I‚Äôll tell you about it and also about the Pink Glow bronzer-blush. If you are a blush fiend though, I suspect you already own it and can tell me a little more about it yourself! üòâ You don‚Äôt need the Summer Brush to use the product, actually. The Dior Nude Paradise Duo comes with a mini kabuki brush. Don‚Äôt be fooled by its diminutive size. This soft, dense and full kabuki brush picks up colour very easily and very well, and applies it to skin very easily too. I find that using a gentle hand and applying the product in circular motions on skin gives a smooth, even colour, and you can buff it to blend as well. A very worthy inclusion, just as they did with last year‚Äôs bronzing powder. A+ for execution! The compact is similar to that of the Diorskin Nude Tan bronzing powders. The palette is a heavy shiny metal case with the Dior signature cannage print on the top. I have to say, packaging wise, they made sure you got your RM198 worth! üôÇ Diorskin Nude Tan Aurora Bronzing Powder (2012) and Dior Nude Tan Paradise Duo Pink Glow 001 pictured with the Summer Brush Here is the comparison with the Diorskin Nude Tan Aurora Bronzing Powder from Summer 2012 for comparison purposes. Aurora was the lighest shade available in the Nude Tan Bronzing Powder collection and had pink tone to give me a more natural, gentle touch of colour to my skin. By contrast, you will notice that the bronzer side of Pink Glow has a deeper tone. On the pink side, you get 2 shades of pink ‚Äì a light pink and a deeper, brighter pink. I personally found that the colours were rather pigmented when I use a brush with them, but when I tried to swatch the shades, it wasn‚Äôt so easy. Here is my best attempt üòõ Left-Right: Top Left quarter, Bottom left quarter, Top Right quarter, Bottom Right quarter You may notice that the shades don‚Äôt show a dramatic change in colour gradation, but are fairly pigmented. The bronzer half is rather warm while the pink blush side has a slightly cooler edge to the colour. Personally, when used alone, I find that the bronzer side pulls some strong orange tones on my skin and can look much too warm. The pinks when used alone, have a warm rose-pink tone that is quite flattering even on their own. However, you won‚Äôt be using it quarter by quarter. You‚Äôd just swirl your brush all over in a circular motion and then blend. You could also use it half and half ‚Äì bronzer to contour and blush for colour. I just do an all over colour because of the previously noted orange tones. I also find that the blush side has very fine milled shimmer but the bronzer side is matte. So I don‚Äôt quite agree with the reviews that say that the Paradise Duo bronzer-blush applies matte. It applies with a hint of shimmer on skin so do note that if you prefer something matte. It isn‚Äôt obtrusive, but there is most certainly a glow. If you are a touch heavy handed, you end up with something like this üòõ I used the Summer Brush initially, and I was very surprised at how much product it picks up. So, I strongly suggest that you swirl the brush over the product and be sure to tap off excess before you apply to your skin. I spent a while blending out the colour before I could comfortably step outdoors LOL! üòÄ But I showed you this, because I wanted to show just how different the colour looked on skin as opposed to in the pan. In the pan, I expected to get a light pink toned powder but on skin, it turned out peachy-pink! The rose pink tones blend with the bronzer to create a peachy shade that I think will flatter most of us. If you have a skintone that‚Äôs deeper than mine, you will find it much easier to wear this product because it will give you a very pretty glow to the skin. The pink tones add colour while the bronzer side adds warmth and the result is a healthy glow. If you have light skintone, I will warn you to please be a little light handed or you may end up looking like you spent a little too long in the sun. I just spent the weekend sitting by the beach so as you might imagine, I look a little like my photo above‚Ä¶ without using Pink Glow! LOL! üòÄ After I blend it out a little more, I get something a little better. Other products: Giorgio Armani Eyes to Kill Silk Eyeshadow in #15, Dior Addict Extreme lipstick in Lucky A peachy pink glow with a touch of warm base. I like to add on a little more pink on the apples of the cheeks for a little pop of colour. Also, I found that if you use the little kabuki that‚Äôs included, you actually end up with a slightly more forgiving colour on skin and its very easy to blend. A very soft blush brush too gives a softer, more forgiving colour. I do however, also find that the product is rather powdery. So, after using, I have to blow off the excess powder from the surface. Nothing that really bugs me, but something I have to mention üôÇ Is it for everyone? Well, nah it isn‚Äôt. But its a beautiful piece of work, it stays on well on my skin, its incredibly easy to blend, it gives you a beautiful glow and for me, its really pigmented so I‚Äôd say its bang for your buck! üòÄ The accompanying product launched in the collection is this Summer Brush Blush Brush . The bright red bristles are, I‚Äôm told by the SA, synthetic and it is pretty soft, although not as soft as other synthetic brushes I‚Äôve used. It is supposed to be a blush brush, so it is tapered to allow for easy blush/bronzer application. I have to say that the red bristles do add a bright, fun pop of colour to the usual black brush arsenal most of us will own, but its actually a bit of a damper, because its not easy to see just how much product you have picked up. I find that it does pick up product very well, having tried it with various blushes I own, but its hard to tell just how much you‚Äôve got on the brush. So its actually quite easy to make mistakes. In terms of application however, it does live up to its claims of offering light coverage and easy blending. If you tap off excess colour, it will apply a light veil of colour to your skin, just enough to give you a gentle blushing glow and blending product is also very easy. It feels soft on skin, not too scratchy and it does a pretty good job overall. I‚Äôm just not too sure about the colour. Left: Dior Backstage Powder Brush Right: Dior Summer Blush Brush Here‚Äôs a comparison between the Dior Powder brush and the Summer blush brush for an idea of size. Its not as fluffy or as dense as a powder brush, and the longer bristles mean its more pliable which results in a softer application of product and colour. Its nice to have but not a must have, in my view. I‚Äôd still stick by my Lunasol blush brush üôÇ In a nutshell The Dior Tan Paradise Duo Pink Glow bronzer-blush is a limited edition offering in the Bird of Paradise summer collection. The product can be used by swirling the included mini kabuki brush around the colours, tapping off the excess and then applying to your cheeks as you would a blush. I personally find its best use this way. You can however, also use it separately as bronzer to contour and then blush for colour and a pop of colour on the apples of the cheeks. For me, I find that Pink Glow applies to skin a rather peachy pink tone that will be flattering to most skintones. There is another shade in Coral Glow that isn‚Äôt available in Asia. The Summer Blush Brush is a limited edition red bristled blush brush. I‚Äôm told by the sales assistant that the bristles are synthetic but they do pick up product very well, and do apply and blend product well on skin. I do find that the red bristles, albeit very eye catching, can be a bit hard to use in that you can barely see how much product you have picked up. I already have a blush brush I adore so I‚Äôd say that this one is a nice one to have, but not a must have. Paradise Duo Pink Glow Pros: Flattering to most skintones, Pigmented, Kabuki brush included is practical and very usable, Fine milled powder and very easily blended on skin Paradise Duo Pink Glow Cons: Limited edition, Very fair skinned ladies will need a very light hand Who will like this: Anyone who loves a pretty blush or a peachy pink blush Summer Blush Brush Pros: Bristles are not scratchy, Easy to apply product and blend Summer Blush Brush Cons: Red bristles make it hard to see how much product is picked up Who will like this: Anyone who wants a fun and usable blush brush in their collection Asia doesn‚Äôt get Paradise Duo in Coral Glow so you can see it in action on Tine . To say I wanted Coral Glow badly after reading her review is an understatement. I wanted it so badly, I told my Aussie beauty/bag buddy to hoof it down to her closest Dior counter and test them both side by side for me to tell me if I needed Coral Glow. I trust her views implicitly and I knew she would tell me if I did. This was A$82 we‚Äôre talking about here. Waaay more than RM198! Thankfully (or maybe not) the report was that no, I did not need Coral Glow. Swatched alongside each other, they look similar enough that I could forsake one for the other. Christine of Temptalia agrees. That‚Äôs A$82 saved for ‚Ä¶ Tom Ford makeup brushes! LOL üòÄ Did you pick up the Paradise Duo in Pink Glow or Coral Glow? Is the Summer blush brush something that you might like to own? I had my eye firmly on the Paradise Duo powders the minute I saw the promo images. I have to say I‚Äôm very happy with this and I think its quite worth what you pay for, if you‚Äôd like to get a workable bronzer and blush in one handy compact. I‚Äôm less crazy about the brush. I love the colour red, but red bristles on a brush is rather unnerving LOL! üòÄ Paris B Dior Nude Tan Paradise Duo Pink Glow Price: RM198 ; Dior Summer Blush Brush Price: RM210; Availability: Dior counters nationwide Limited Edition: Yes, Bird of Paradise Summer 2013 collection</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Author</name><value><array><data><value><string>Paris B</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>Date</name><value><array><data><value><string>2013-05-27 08:30:59</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>_template</name><value><string>c7de-44fb-8840</string></value></member><member><name>_cached_page_id</name><value><string>cde85d1a1bbc751476bd62fe8ffaf2d8b406179d</string></value></member></struct></value><value><struct><member><name>_type</name><value><string>Period Skin Care Companies maternity skin care</string></value></member><member><name>Title</name><value><array><data><value><string>When planning a summer mix holiday, put Panama and Capri on your list even if they‚Äôre just Diorblush Cheek Cremes</string></value></data></array></value></member><member><name>url</name><value><string>http://www.mywomenstuff.com/2013/07/diorblush-cheek-creme-panama-capri/</string></value></member><member><name>Text</name><value><array><data><value><string>When word leaked out that Dior was doing a cream blush in little pots that looked like macarons, you should have seen how much of a tizz the beauty blogging world went into! Suddenly cream blush was back IN! I‚Äôd say its rather opportune since I‚Äôve only just worked out how best to apply cream blush for a lovely natural look, so I was finally brave enough to tackle these. For your viewing pleasure today is the Diorblush Cheek Creme in 651 Panama and 851 Capri , 2 of the 4 shades available in the capsule Summer Mix collection. The cream blushes come with matching nail polishes in similar bright pops of colour. Dior‚Äôs offering come in a glass pot with a black screw on cap, with CD printed on the cover. What I like about the pots is that the opening is large so its easy for you to get your fingers or the tip of a brush in there quite easily. It reminds me of the pots used for cream eyeshadow and its about as big. Something that perturbs me when I open the cap is to find that the cream blush has ‚Äúshrunk‚Äù. You may notice even from a brand new tub, that the sides are pulled away from the glass tub and if you are experimental as I am and upturn the tub over your palm, the cream blush falls out like a little cake. It does look very much like a macaron at this point! üòõ In this regard, I do think a little work needs to be done with the formula in terms of presentation. In terms of performance, I have to say, colour me impressed! The texture of these cream blushes are actually rather dry to the touch. They aren‚Äôt sticky or ‚Äúwet‚Äù the way some cream blushes are and have a dry touch so it is pretty much a cream to powder finish that is comfortable for application and when wearing on skin. Left-Right: Panama and Capri You might be able to see how the blush has pulled away from the sides of the tub. I tipped Panama out by accident while taking these sets of pictures üòõ 651 Panama is a bright coral shade with warm orange tones. Truth to tell, I was a little afraid of it. It looks a little too bright for my use and a little too warm. The swatch which you‚Äôll see below didn‚Äôt quite help allay my fears either. However, as you will see a little further down, when I sheer it out on my cheeks and only use a little what I get on my skin is a lovely coral-pink flush. It is a little bright, but quite easily sheered out and has a nice pop of colour. On a more medium-deep skintone, I think this shade would be made for you for the prettiest flush on your cheeks! 851 Capri is a much more acceptable to the masses light pink shade that is described as ‚Äúcotton candy‚Äù. Its light, but not that light to me. This one does not swatch very impressive. It looks almost too light going on my arm but remember, you don‚Äôt wear blushes on your arms, you wear them on your cheeks! So I was very pleasantly surprised to see the very pretty fresh kawaii glow it gives to my cheeks, seemingly a bloom of youth from within. Very pretty! However, this one will likely work best for those who have light to light-medium skintones because it is a very light shade and anyone with a deeper skintone will be frustrated. These swatches of Panama on left and Capri on right should give you an idea of what it looks when applied heavily. I just rubbed my finger over the surface of the blush and drew 1 swipe down my arm. It is surprisingly pigmented! You might also see how Panama on my skin is such a bright orange while Capri is a much more wearable colour on my skintone, but how it may not show up well on a deeper skintone. But its when its on the cheeks that I think these cream blushes come into their own. They are very easy to apply with your fingers. I use my 3rd and 4th finger, pick up a little colour and then tap it on my cheeks, blending as I go. The colour goes on quite strongly but it is very easy to blend but I don‚Äôt favour this method because I find it messes up my base of foundation and concealer. However, what I‚Äôve found is that when I use my cream blush application technique with a brush , lightly bouncing it on my skin, the colour goes on a little more light, but much more even and makes it a lot easier to get it right immediately and to add layers, and I don‚Äôt mess up my base! On left, we have Panama which as you have seen in the arm swatch above, is a scary bright orange. But when just a little is used and sheered out, I get a warm glow to the cheeks, that looks like I‚Äôve spent some time out in the sun. This was applied using fingers and I used a little more so it‚Äôd show up in photographs. When I wear this normally, I apply a little less and it is less of a ‚Äúsunburnt‚Äù look üòõ On right is Capri which is a very pretty glow-from-within pink on the skin. Again, I applied this with my fingers and a little more than I would wear normally so the glow is generally a lot more subtle. It does dry down to a powder finish and doesn‚Äôt really slip once it goes on. It doesn‚Äôt stain skin either, so you can wipe your fingers on a piece of tissue when you‚Äôre done and it‚Äôs clean. As for longevity, the general consensus I‚Äôve gleaned from Tracy and Tine is that they last long, almost all day. I do wonder if it might be the climate where they are both based (cooler and drier) because here in the tropics, I didn‚Äôt experience all day longevity. It does last on me up to about 5-6 hours with no problems (and even through very vigorous house cleaning as I did after I took the photos haah! üòõ ) but not much longer than that. I also find that how well it lasts depends on the foundation base I use. When I use the Diorsnow BB Creme , it lasts longer than when I use the Guerlain BB Creme or the Clinique CC Cream. When I use the Revlon Colorstay foundation or the Laura Mercier Silk Creme foundation as I did in these photos, it lasts longer than when I use a more emollient foundation. So, for me mileage varies but I sort of forgive that, because the very natural transparent flush on your skin is just SO. DAMN. PRETTY. ‚Äônuff said üòõ In a nutshell The Diorblush Cheek Creme cream blushes are limited edition offerings from Dior in their Summer Mix capsule collection that introduces 4 shades of cream blush and matching nail polishes. The cream blushes have a dry powdery finish and they perform like a cream to powder product so it isn‚Äôt sticky or slippery at all. It is very easy to apply whether with fingers or a brush and the colour is very easily built up. I like the transparent pigment that allows it to give your skin a very natural flush of colour, almost as if you were truly blushing from within. A very healthy sort of look, without looking like you‚Äôve put on makeup. The only thing I don‚Äôt quite like is the packaging element where the product looks like its dried out and pulled away from the sides of the tub even though its brand new, and also how it can fall out like a piece of cake if you aren‚Äôt careful. Otherwise, these are winners in my blush book. Pros: Portable, Lightweight texture never turns oily on skin, Cream to powder finish that gives a lovely natural flush to the cheeks, Wide opening makes it easy to pick up product, Pigmented colour that is easily adjustable with fingers or a brush, Longlasting with the right foundation or in cooler drier climates Cons: Pricey, Limited Edition, Looks dry even though its new Who will like this: Anyone who likes using cream blushes, Anyone who wants an easy to use non-staining cheek colour that looks very natural on skin In case you were wondering, yes for purposes of this post, I did wear both Panama and Capri on different sides of my cheeks üòõ Panama on your left, Capri on your right. Other products used: Laura Mercier Silk Creme Foundation in Soft Ivory dusted with Guerlain Meteorites in Teint Beige, Nars Radiant Creamy Concealer in Vanilla Light 2, Giorgio Armani Eyes to Kill Silk Eyeshadow in #15, Lancome Gloss in Love I might even be able to get away with going out looking like this. Eh? Eh? üòõ Have you checked these new Dior cream blushes out? Which colour do you prefer? I spotted these at the counter early last week when I was hurrying through and peeped at the other 2 colours not featured here ‚Äì Bikini 871 (a bright warm pink) and Pareo 971 (a bright deep fuchsia pink). I‚Äôm sort of glad I didn‚Äôt get those because they do look like quite a handful. But I‚Äôm also glad Dior came out with those shades because I can safely tell you that there‚Äôs a blush for everyone in this little collection of 4. Most of the shades will show up very prettily on most medium-deep skintone while Capri prettily covers the light skintones.

You may have to hit up some friends in Asia to help you if its not coming to a store near you any time soon üòâ Like Serie Noire, the blush comes in a smooth pebble shaped compact that despite being a bit bulky, is actually very ergonomic when held in your hands.

Size and weight wise, its exactly the same as its deeper cousin from 2 years ago. Colourwise, you can see they are quite different. Blush G Sakura on left is predominantly pink with a cool slant to the colours, while Blush G Serie Noire is decidedly more coral with a warmer tone. Don‚Äôt be fooled by that large strip of bright pink in Blush G Sakura however. The colours apply very light on skin. Here are the swatches I showed you before, where I swatched it with my fingers. Sometimes, fingers don‚Äôt pick up color as well as brushes so that was my initial impression. Blush G Sakura swatched Top to Bottom : L-R: Shimmery peach, Shimmery white, Shimmery deeper pink, Shimmery light pink, Blended Yep, very very light and sheer colours. Now, this is both a good and bad thing depending on how you like to wear your blushes. When I use my regular Lunasol Cheek Brush N (which I use for every blush) I need to actually layer it on before the colour starts to show up on my skin. I do have quite a light skintone to start with (Guerlain 01 Beige Pale foundation) and even then, this takes a couple of layers for it to show up nicely. If I use a stiffer more dense brush, its easier to get the colours to show. As I said, its a good and bad thing. Good if you are the sort who likes light pink blushes that you can quickly swipe on and go without making a mistake. Bad if you are used to strong colours and prefer using a blush that needs less work. These were 2 angles I thought represented the blush best, to show you just how it looks on my skin. I used about 2-3 light layers in these photos (using my Lunasol brush) and you can see that on my skin, I get the barest hint of pink on my skin but it is a very natural sort of pink that doesn‚Äôt quite say ‚ÄúHey look at me! I‚Äôm wearing pink blush!‚Äù In the photo on the left, you can also see that there is shimmer reflected but it isn‚Äôt metallic or very bright. It doesn‚Äôt accentuate my pores nor does it look artificial. It gives my skin a nice sort of glow to the cheeks, but I do have to apply more of the lower half to see colour. I can tell you though, that this one is terribly hard to overdo. I know, that‚Äôs a strange sort of statement but its a plus point. I can layer it on and on and still don‚Äôt look like a baboon‚Äôs bottom. The colour is that subtle so its a nice blush to start with if you think finding a blush that doesn‚Äôt turn you into a clown is hard work. I‚Äôve started to really like wearing light blushes. I went through a phase of strong coloured blushes once but I‚Äôm now slowing easing back the throttle and wearing light colors (Benefit Dandelion, Hervana and most of my Dior blushes are finally seeing more love! Yay! üòÄ ) so for now, this Blush G Sakura fits right into my routine. A cute little pink brush is included if you lift up the blush pan. I personally find the bristles scratchy so I don‚Äôt use it. I have never used the ones included in any of the Guerlain face palettes. Guerlain may do makeup well, but their brushes could do with more work IMO üòõ Holding both Blush G Sakura and Blush G Serie Noire side by side however, I noticed there were differences between the two. Primarily, this was on the quality front. I felt that Blush G Serie Noire had a better constructed case that felt more solid in my hands. The black case feels almost like a heavy lacquered case and so does the area that holds the blush. By contrast, I felt that the white case of Blush G Sakura felt lighter and thinner and less solid. It felt like the plastic that it is. The metallic frame that holds the blush didn‚Äôt appeal to me. I felt it would have been better symmetry if they had constructed a white frame instead as they did the black one. Even the velvet pouches felt different. The one that houses the Blush G Serie Noire is black velvet with fuchsia satin lining. The Blush G Sakura one has a grey microfibre feel with satin pink lining. The microfibre feels less luxurious and even if it could be hardier, a lot of us think with our senses and the fact is that velvet feels more luxurious. Once more for good measure üòõ Cheeks: Guerlain Blush G Sakura | Eyes: Dior Cherie Bow Smoky Rose Trio | Lips: Dior Addict Extreme in Plaza Despite the fact I do like this blush and I‚Äôm very happy I got my hands on it ‚Äì what blush fiend wouldn‚Äôt? üòÄ ‚Äì I will stick my head out and tell you that this is NOT a must have. Shiseido Camellia was a must have. This one is a ‚ÄúNice To Have‚Äù. The colour is easily duped with any light pink blush and if you have deeper skintone, you will definitely be let down as there is a risk all you‚Äôd see is shimmer on your skin. But if you like light sheer pink blushes and you have the funds, and you love how this looks, then I think its a great quality blush that is nice to have üôÇ In a nutshell The Guerlain Blush G Sakura Cherry Blossom blush is a limited edition in the Blanc de Perles range which Guerlain releases in Asia. As of now, this appears to be sold only in Asia or perhaps in very limited distribution in the Western world. The blush tone is predominantly pink and it is very light and sheer. If you use a fluffy soft blush brush, you may need a few layers before it shows up to your satisfaction. If you use a more dense brush it shows up better. On deeper skintones, there is a risk of it showing up as just shimmer so I‚Äôd not recommend this one for anyone with medium-deep skintones. I do like it, and I‚Äôm happy I got it, but this one isn‚Äôt a must have. Just very nice to have üôÇ Pros: Light sheer pink is sweet and gives a glow from within look, Easy to wear and almost impossible to overdo, Pretty! Cons: Light and sheer colours may not suit everyone‚Äôs tastes, Limited Edition and only in Asia Who will like this: Anyone who likes light sheer pink blushes, Collectors and fans of Guerlain powders Did this blush catch your eye? How do you feel about these continent exclusive releases? I‚Äôve been around the scene a while and I remember that about 5-6 years back, every brand had some form of Asia-Exclusive item from various collections. MAC ones especially would fetch crazy prices on ebay. But that craze seems to have faded. I wonder if its coming back. I sometimes wish we get certain items found in other countries but having spoken to some marketing people, I understand now that different markets have different preferences and I guess they can‚Äôt please everyone!
